when steve lopez , <unk> times , one day , one day , one day , one day , a day , a day , he was going to come from the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a african-american , <unk> , rough , homeless , homeless , who had just lived on a violin who had two vibrating .
many of you will know the story , because of <unk> article about it was a book , again , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> , and that 's the fundamental career of a <unk> career in his <unk> schizophrenia .
<unk> left , and then , a <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived as a <unk> in the streets of <unk> <unk> in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you to read , <unk> book , or to read the film , not just understand the wonderful relationship between these two men , but also , how to the music that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's going to get the <unk> , <unk> way to get the <unk> .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the alliance , <unk> <unk> .
he had just a map of <unk> and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he talked in a very <unk> and <unk> clay and <unk> clinton , and hillary clinton in the <unk> world , and that 's all the <unk> of the world , and that 's all the <unk> , of the first part of the first <unk> of <unk> fourth program .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got a email in the state that the state of <unk> was interested in me .
i need to mention saying that <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it was already treated with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been <unk> him .
and as a result , he 's now , in the <unk> , they 're just <unk> , and they 're like that , and he 's sometimes in the streets of <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> , and the <unk> of his own mind is <unk> .
and in exactly like a <unk> , <unk> , when we started with the first grade in walt disney grade , he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible cause and smoke and it was telling him in the sleep .
i had scared , not the way , but i had scared that i could lose it in a particular state , and that i could destroy his relationship to <unk> and talk about the <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , in <unk> eyes , a whole whole change was in .
it was as though he stood under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose thought was a catalyst .
<unk> <unk> attachment to understand , in a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracle took his violin , and then , after a miracle , some clips of <unk> <unk> , and asked me to play , and she asked me to play her , `` <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started talking about music , started from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he did n't only have a <unk> of knowledge of music , but it was also a close personal relationship .
he talked from her with her passion and a understanding of that i could only know of my colleague from los angeles .
by making music and over music , from this <unk> , confused man who was pulled from the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> musicians , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for <unk> , music is <unk> health .
because the music allows it to him , and the <unk> and delusions of his imagination , and the world with its imagination , creativity in something that are real suffering .
and so he 's how he <unk> his <unk> fellow .
i understood that this is the natural creature of art .
and this is the reason why we make music : so we have something that we have in all , deep , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our art lens .
and the reality of the expression is that we 've got all of us all , and it 's going to be inspired and create us .
what 's <unk> , so took the music back to a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music took him back in a family of musicians that understood his talent and then learn it .
and i 'll always get back to <unk> music , whether , in terms of disney <unk> , or in <unk> , in <unk> , because he 's remember , why i grew up and remember that musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i 've got to stolen the <unk> .
i hope you express me .
so i 've known a lot of fish .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate kind of a little bit .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , a book on the ground .
what a fish are .
it 's better , he was in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of sustainability .
so you could be able to get it to sell him .
i had this story with a whole story .
one day , the boss would call the boss 's company , and asked whether i could have a event with a event that 's the sustainability of the farm .
and of course , i said .
here was a company that would have been trying to solve what this incredible problem has become a difference . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans like we 've beat the forests of forests .
it 's hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the large fish , who are , who love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so , perhaps or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments of the environment , <unk> <unk> , most of you , most of you , most of you , are very inefficient , we take images . a big disadvantage .
he 's got a <unk> of 15 .
that 's called 15 pounds of <unk> , so you get a pound of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it 's not very good .
so finally , finally , i was going to make a company that tried to make it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day i was called the <unk> of the boss 's boss for the company .
call him the statement .
`` the <unk> , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right , you 're famous in the ocean that you do n't have a little bit of
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste are distributed to the <unk> of the fish , not focused . ''
and then he added , `` we 're essentially a own world .
this is a <unk> of <unk> , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
one thing to be great .
`` <unk> to what ? '' you get your ticket ?
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . put on .
and in this evening , i was in bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just to the event , it 's <unk> .
i said , `` well , what 's sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he knows that . he 's going to be the <unk> .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a boatload answer to a <unk> answer , until i finally <unk> the <unk> biologists .
let 's call him , and we know .
`` frank '' i said , `` what are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , `` well , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . ''
i said , `` how much percent of your own person <unk> is chicken ? ''
in the assumption , perhaps two percent .
`` well , this is about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what is sustainable in the <unk> ? ''
there was a long pause in the leadership and he said , `` there 's just a terrible chicken on the world . ''
i 'm betting me from this fish .
no , not because i am a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i 'm actually .
no , i 've got <unk> , i actually <unk> this fish , because i swear to god , the fish after that entertainment after chicken .
this second fish , that 's another kind of <unk> .
it 's romantic kind of , the way you know , the better you know , the better you know , you know the fish , you love the fish .
i 've eaten it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish for a fish .
she was in a way of a <unk> .
he came on the table with a bright white white white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can be a fish doing so good , after <unk> ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
call him miguel <unk> . in fact , he 's <unk> .
and no , he did n't have a <unk> , and he 's not an chef . at least in the way that they do , and i understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner , right ?
it 's near the <unk> river .
until the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're in the <unk> , which is basically wetlands .
they were doing that by the country .
they built these complicated of mating , and they were <unk> water out of the country , and beyond the river .
well , they could n't make sure that was n't , not economically economically .
and the green was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what the place are a lot of birds .
and there 's a spanish company in green company , and there 's a spanish company .
what did you do ?
they have the river of the water .
they literally have the <unk> .
instead of <unk> the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of acres -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> , <unk> , and he did n't have miguel and his company , the environmental destruction completely .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this one .
you 're looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see , what you see is , are <unk> channels and these dense , voluptuous , <unk> .
i was there in a long time ago with miguel .
he 's an incredible fellow , three parts of the <unk> and a part of the <unk> .
okay ? there were and fighting us through the wetlands and i was <unk> and <unk> , and i was <unk> to my knee , and miguel <unk> is in calm in peace .
and here he takes a rare <unk> landfill .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , there 's a pattern of <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> .
it turns out that miguel the largest part of his career spent in africa national park .
i asked him how he became a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i do nothing about fish .
i am a expert in relationships . ''
and then he goes , and there 's <unk> in more <unk> birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and you do n't understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> , which i had in the <unk> .
so i had it , i had a <unk> . i said , `` miguel , how does it come so good as well ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , phytoplankton , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what do your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he 's going to go to tell me that there 's a <unk> system that is that fish would eat , which would be eating the wilderness .
the <unk> biomass , which is phytoplankton , which is what the fish get beat up .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there is no food .
the farm is , who 's not a stick to get your <unk> ?
later , i was going to <unk> <unk> with miguel <unk> and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , which seems like , '' which seems like any farm , which is a <unk> , which i 've ever been , `` how does you possibly succeed ? ''
in the moment , it was a <unk> , too .
and we <unk> the corner and we had a lot of the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of thousands of <unk> , literally <unk> the eye .
`` this is success , '' he said .
`` look at your <unk> , pink .
she <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> you do n't your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> in birds .
well , last year , these <unk> birds were 18 than 250 different ways .
it 's the largest and one of the most important private <unk> in the whole continent .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> , not the last one that you want to have on a <unk> ? ''
he saved his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> , not heavy .
this is a <unk> network .
the flamingos , they 're doing the shrimp .
they 're <unk> <unk> .
so the <unk> the belly is the better the system .
okay , let 's rethink the mental . one farm that does n't get their animals and a farm that 's going to measure their success on health .
one <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , these flamingos should not be even in the state of the war .
they 're <unk> kilometers from a city where the <unk> <unk> is better for the <unk> .
you 're <unk> <unk> over the farm .
and you go through <unk> miles .
they do that , because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had an kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , miguel , fly <unk> kilometers to the farm and fly fly back to the night ?
do you make the kids ? ''
he looked at me , when i had a song in the <unk> of the <unk> .
he said , `` no . they do that because food is better . ''
i did n't mentioned the skin of my loved fish , the delicious , and i do n't like a <unk> . i do n't like it . i do n't like you .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm not going to leave you almost .
and yet , when i tried to try and tries to try and miss it in <unk> , she did n't even bother <unk> .
they were <unk> and in fact , as you would take a bites from the ocean .
i mentioned <unk> , and he 'd <unk> .
he said , `` the skin looks like a sponge .
she 's the last authority before you get in the body .
she 's made of evolution to be <unk> <unk> . ''
and then he added , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , which is not <unk> your fish . a farm who has its success on its own legacy .
and then i realized , if he says , one farm that has no farm , he had a lot of , he <unk> the water , because the water , which is going through this farm from the river .
it 's a river that brings all the things that are all the things that rivers are tend to have these days of these , they 're <unk> , chemical pollutants , by <unk> .
and when it was fighting by the system , and this is the water , and it 's water as a water .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only a farm that not feed their animals , not just a farm , which is a farm on your own legacy , but a farm , which is literally a <unk> , and not only for these fish , but i do n't have to be
because the water is <unk> , it 's in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'll take it , and i think it 's also to do , because these <unk> , which is also telling me .
you could say that you 're a recipe for the future , whether we 're talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need is a radical idea of agriculture , of agriculture , from one , from a , actually , actually , really <unk> .
but for many people , this is a little bit too much .
we are not a <unk> , we 're lover . we are lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that the things are you who tell you the future of food , someone else says , `` hey , people , i love pink flamingos , but how do you feed the world ?
how are you feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we 're going to produce enough calories to produce more than to feed more than the food .
a billion people will be dying today .
one billion -- this is more than ever -- because of <unk> neuron in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i do n't like this question because they have the logic of our <unk> , the last 50 years .
<unk> grain of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , chemicals on earth , <unk> , chicken , the <unk> , are just to <unk> agribusiness , `` when we feed more people like this ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the business business of the american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , the <unk> capital that allows the ground to the production .
this is not a school , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> country , not by pump , but by <unk> water , not by chainsaw , but not by <unk> , but not in the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , do n't look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it 's never done something really good to eat .
so instead , we 're looking at the ecological model .
this is the one that 's in two billion years of <unk> .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel ,
businesses who are not the worlds for themselves , businesses , rather than <unk> , businesses , businesses are growing , rather than only hard , but they 're only <unk> , farmers , farmers , but experts are <unk> .
because they 're the ones who are also experts for flavor .
and if i am really honest , you 're a better chef than i ever .
you know , this is right , because if the future is good food , you will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to talk to you today is that the complete data we consume , is it bigger than the sum of your parts , and rather than thinking about how to be more as we use information , and we see how to see the way that we see information , and we see that trends would be able to see that shape , and we see that trends would be
so what we see here is a typical state of war in age .
so the program i use is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter to a particular cause of a cause , say , accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that 's because the <unk> are in the <unk> , and they 're over the <unk> .
we can go out and see the data and then look at the data , and then you see that <unk> are <unk> , but not for the usual suspects , but not for each other .
now , if we go on and old , and old , we see 40 years or two years , or the younger thing we have to worry about the world is about people .
and who looks like that , is true that this is true of men .
so you realize that this is the way of information and data in this way , in this way , in this way , in a living in the way of swimming in a living in the different way .
and if we can do this to raw data , why do n't do it for content ?
what we 've got here are the <unk> of the <unk> , which is ever printed in the <unk> .
it 's all there . it 's all online .
you can like to test it in your talk to the talk .
with <unk> , you can get to get to a decade .
you can jump into a particular year .
you can jump straight to a particular copy .
so if i look at this , i see the athletes , which looks like this <unk> and the sports .
i 'm an lance <unk> , so i click on this to me , all expenses to be mentioned in the event .
now , if i want to get a <unk> situation , i could think `` ok , what if i 'm going to look at all of the talk ? ''
so i go back to a step and i 'm going to get the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a idea of it , you know that if you 're going to show you in this kind of information , <unk> , spread , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you 're not looking at or not just or <unk> , not just or <unk> .
you do something that 's a little bit different .
it 's something between and we think it can change the way that information can be used .
i want to make a little bit more on what a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is we took each individual <unk> , and they were <unk> on a little bit of <unk> .
the <unk> contains a short , and a symbol for the area that you come from .
i 'm just showing the top-10 500 <unk> in the <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the themes that are the issues of wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose the issue of the topic .
now , after i 've been elected , i know , i know , the <unk> who are <unk> at most of the day , the time of the year , the year of the year .
this is really important , there 's a realization that is not a realization that 's not a single <unk> .
this is just to see when you step back and look at all .
<unk> on a particular of these <unk> , i can see this <unk> in time , `` people '' in the year , '' and all the year , you can see all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of these are <unk> . some of science , some of the science , there 's less , from the economy , here 's my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , a ted prize winner .
so we can jump up and watch the watch , and we look at all the ted prize .
you see , we 're looking at the web , the first time is a network , not just to the side of side , but it 's a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else could be a little surprise .
i just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i do n't want to call a browser ; it 's really no browser , but you can see the websites so we have to put these <unk> , and we 're going to give these <unk> to each of the individual website .
so i can go back to a step , and you can jump up a specific to a specific <unk> .
so that 's why you 're important , because you just look at the look at random and in the way that we can look at the same way of the same way in the same way .
so i can see in my course , in a particular <unk> way .
so here 's the state of the entire demonstration i 've ever been going to go to this .
and i can sort of all of all , what i 've been looking at now , is <unk> .
and , when i go back to it again , and i look at all , i can look at this , i could be new to my <unk> , and here i was looking for <unk> , and here 's my name of life , or here , in life ,
and from here , i can go into the side , and you 're going to call it .
it 's a metaphor that 's going to be used in again , and each time it 's bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the curse in the <unk> .
we talk about `` <unk> in information . ''
what if we could turn these situation and the internet on the head , so that 's what we 're going to go from a to a different things , and then you can go to many things , and then see how otherwise otherwise otherwise have remained hidden ?
if we can do this , then this is going to be a <unk> , maybe a new source of information information .
and , instead of going to move in information , we can know it .
and if we know , maybe we can even pull out of the wisdom of it .
so i hear that , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> science fiction .
in my school , i was in school , i was a <unk> in school every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day .
and my nose had always been in a book , a <unk> , which my thought of language in other worlds , and my deep <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
and this curiosity also came in , when i was not in school , by the forests , traveled and <unk> , and they were <unk> , frogs and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
i was totally <unk> , you know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the study .
and my love to science fiction seemed to <unk> in my surroundings , because back in the late '60s , we went to the moon and early in the back of the <unk> .
jacques <unk> came in our living room with his intriguing <unk> , which are we both animals and places and places that we could never could have before .
so that 's probably the good thing that has been <unk> to the <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games still with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so we had to all the time we had to read when kids read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen in our heads .
my response to this is the <unk> and paint from aliens , alien worlds , robots , the <unk> , the way .
in math , i was caught up the teachers , like i was hiding in the textbooks , <unk> , <unk> .
the creativity had to get out of it .
and something happened , what was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows , was that this idea of a unknown world in our earth itself .
certainly i would never be a quiet world with a spaceship . that seemed to me quite unlikely .
but here 's a world i could actually be in the earth , and she was as fascinating and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic , and what i had introduced me to this books .
so i decided to be 15 , i grew up .
the only problem with this is that i was in a little village in canada , a thousand kilometers from the next ocean .
but i did n't know , but i did n't get it .
i 'm betting my father , until he finally finally had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , finding right on the other side of the <unk> , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in the winter in <unk> in the winter of the winter in the winter of the winter , new york .
but the ocean , but the ocean is a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since the 40 years , the 40 years of the <unk> , i spent about three hours under water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the <unk> ocean , the largest ocean , is so rich , how we really ca n't even imagine it .
the heart of nature is not known to the fact , which is not the boundaries , in the way to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until today , i 'm a <unk> awe of the day , i feel the deepest awe of what i see on my <unk> .
and my love to the ocean is in the same intensity like , and the same way , it 's the way .
when i was a <unk> , it was the <unk> .
and the best way of the way that the best way of my inner line , tell me to tell stories with my need to create images ,
and as a kid , i had <unk> and so .
so , the way of the path , images and stories , and that fit together .
of course , the stories i was <unk> from the <unk> , `` terminator , '' `` aliens '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> , i could connecting my preference for the <unk> and then put in the <unk> .
so , my two passions is in my own physical senses .
something interesting happened in `` <unk> '' : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- that we put on <unk> animation , back ,
what was that was , first of the <unk> <unk> , which is ever in a film .
the film took a money , which is , he was just playing his <unk> , but i realized something amazing , the audience was on the world , like <unk> from the magic that ran out of it .
according to arthur , is the law are , of <unk> technology , and magic is not going to be more .
so they looked at something magic .
and that 's what i found is incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that has to be in the <unk> . ''
so we went to `` terminator two , '' my next movie , has a lot .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal . the success was getting quite a very much of the effect on how that effect come .
and it worked . again , we had a whole magical design , and the effect in the audience was the same . but , but we have the film with a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was done , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , together with my good friend of <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called digital <unk> .
the idea of this company was to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and then we did this and sent us a advantage of advantage of a advantage of advantage .
but in the middle of the '90s , we realized that we had in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we had started in the company , it was actually started <unk> .
i wrote this piece of the mouse , which is the bar to talk in the bar in things and <unk> effects in very new heights , with lifelike , expressive characters , which was being made by the <unk> . and the world should be all the <unk> .
but the bar , the bar , and the bar , and the people in my company told me that we do n't have to do it in the way .
so i started that , and i made this other movie about the great ship , the goes on .
the <unk> <unk> , i sold it as a <unk> and julia and <unk> on a ship . it became a <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
but i was actually going to have the real train in the titanic .
so i made this film .
this is the truth . the studio knew that .
i think , i think , by saying , `` we 're looking at the train . we call the real train .
we 're going to show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is incredibly important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i 'm going to <unk> them a expedition .
sound crazy . but this is back to this , that your imagination can create a reality .
we actually started a reality six months later , in a russian months , in a russian <unk> , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , four kilometers under the north atlantic , and i was the real titanic in a <unk> <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really did me really really really really really worst .
and the whole thing was enormous . we had to build cameras and <unk> and everything possible .
and i realized how very these <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go in these <unk> , then you 're going to be <unk> , physically soil , where no hope is on rescue , if you do n't make it back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's as well as i was in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was just obsessed with the deep deep deep deep .
anyway , from the part of curiosity and science , it was all . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and there was a experience that would not be hollywood to me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature , and i could create a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside the <unk> .
in some of the next , i 've seen these things in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , and things that never had ever seen before , and the science of the science , when we saw it , even more words had been found .
so that 's what i was right now , and i wanted to be more .
and so i 'd met a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of decision .
and after the titanic , i told me , `` okay , i want to put my <unk> in hollywood to <unk> and get a while . ''
and then we started , we started to <unk> , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we went back to the train .
we took little robots that we had built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our intent was , and then , the inner ship had been done , which never had been done before .
nobody had ever had the inside of the <unk> . you had no tools for it . so we developed the technology .
now , and there 's now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is quite like this <unk> , and from which i know that once a band had played there .
and i walk with a little <unk> in the ship .
i 'm actually <unk> it , but my mind is within the <unk> .
it felt like i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> , which i 've ever experienced . because before i was a vacuum , i always had to show what the same thing i was left in the <unk> of the <unk> , and i was left tired of <unk> back to <unk>
and this kind of was a precise replica of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
she made this <unk> idea that you use such <unk> and so that 's how to be the own consciousness in the vehicle , in these other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a little bit of view , perhaps , perhaps , maybe maybe in some decades , if you have a <unk> , to do something like , in all kinds of things that i could imagine .
so after these elaborate , we started seeing what we had seen in the bottom , to be able to find out , for example , which is that <unk> , where we saw these incredibly astonishing animals , but that 's kind of alien , but there 's the scale .
they live with <unk> .
they 're not in a local system , which is what we do .
and so you see animals that are directly to <unk> a <unk> c , which is that they can survive .
and at the same time , i was very interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and the story to do with nasa , and the <unk> plan , and you drive to russia , from the mission of the mission of <unk> , and then you go to the international <unk> , and then
this was fascinating .
but at the end , it was at the end of the end , i took me to <unk> us with us in the deep ocean .
i took them with and <unk> them to the world , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the vents for the vents , and they took out to look at the <unk> , and so
we were doing science and actually <unk> science , but we said , `` well , <unk> .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , then as a child , and the plays in reality .
and over this <unk> , i 've learned a lot .
i 've learned a lot of science , but i 'm now now think you have to think a director , a director can be a leader , or so .
but i do n't mind much of leadership before i do this led to .
because of a particular point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what 's coming ? ''
these stinking films do n't bring us money .
we 're just playing the <unk> . it 's no turning back .
everyone , i 'm between titanic and avatar , '' and he would have a lot of the <unk> on a towel on a towel .
i 've all these films , which made these <unk> , for a very little audience .
no fame , no honor , no credit , no money . what do you do ?
you 're going to make it to be the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment , you 're making it , and because of the weird link , and because of the weird link , which is that a little group of people are a team of people .
because we have all of 10 to 12 to 12 people who have been working on , for years , we 've got to have been a lot of these <unk> <unk> , sometimes we were two to three months to lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the impact you have a difference because you have a task to explain .
when you go to country , and we got ta do it , we had to do that , the <unk> , which is the whole technology , and the things that 's really , the human <unk> , and the issues of the human <unk> , '' and that 's like the other people , and that 's like the other people , and that 's like the other people , and the other thing that you 're on the other <unk> , and the other people do n't explain , in the other way , or the soldier in the world , the other people who can be in the police , and in the other people , the other people who have been in the world , and in the people , in the world , and in the people ,
there 's a connection , a link to respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film , and i tried the same leadership role , which is that you get his team and respect to the lobby .
and that 's the dynamic in the way that the dynamic changed .
so i stood back with a little kid on a little kid on a little kid on a little kid on a little bit of light on the <unk> area , and we turned `` avatar with a new technology , which was n't yet before .
it 's incredibly exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were going to have a period of weeks .
and so , my way , my way , the way , the films is going to be done .
there was people who thought we 'd have this <unk> , yes , really <unk> and <unk> in the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , which is really the way that has changed .
so what can we have to conclude with all ?
what are we learned ?
i think , i think , the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the movements of your team is more important than all of these world 's population .
and i get a kid , i 'll say young filmmaker , say , `` give me a advice , how i could do something . ''
and i say , `` do n't give you a problem .
the next one is , you know , do n't give you a little bit of yourself . do n't do you yourself not not not make you against themselves . but you take risks on you . ''
the nasa has a <unk> : `` fail is not a alternative . ''
but in the art and in the study and in exploration , failure to be a alternative , because it guarantees it in a <unk> .
no big achievement , the innovation , became ever been stopped .
you have to be prepared to take these risks .
this is the idea that i want to give you with the path , not , is a alternative , fear , fear . thank you .
today , i 'm talking about energy and climate .
and that 's surprising , perhaps , because my <unk> of the foundation are primarily about the <unk> and seed , to provide the things that we 've been inventing and provide the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , which is actually more than the more important than for each other than the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to be grown over many years , and it 's too much better than it will be as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as things like it can not be done in terms of how it can not be done in the way that your <unk> environment can not be .
it leads to <unk> . it leads to <unk> . it leads to <unk> .
so , there is an issue for you , it will be a climate .
and also , the <unk> of them for them is very important .
in fact , if you could only have a price of one thing , the price of the price would be far from far from the most effective .
well , the <unk> is about time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> drive , the industrial revolution in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we 've got mad , <unk> materials , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but , when we cut the price -- let 's cut up the price -- we 're going to get a new barrier and these <unk> is filled with co2 .
co2 warms , the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the co2 <unk> , which leads to the <unk> and put some very negative effects . effects , the <unk> , which is the surprising ecosystems that are actually <unk> that the natural ecosystems are not to adapt to be able to adapt and then <unk> .
now , the exact connection between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are there , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there 's a lot of things that are bad about how bad these consequences are . but they 're very bad !
i have asked the <unk> times , `` do we really get to zero to zero ?
is n't it not a quarter of a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we get near zero , is going to continue to increase the temperature .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than saying , we have a 3.5 mile high truck , which has to have a three feet of bridge , and then you can just put it in the same .
this is to go down to down , to zero .
well , we 're <unk> each year , over 26 billion tons .
each americans are about 20 tons of tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it 's about five tons of five tons of the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that are <unk> to zero .
it 's been <unk> .
just different economic changes have it affects and we have to have to be in <unk> increase in reduction and to be a reduction in zero .
and these equation has four factors . a little bit of <unk> -- they have this thing -- co2 -- the co2 , which you want to bring to zero , and that 's the number of people that are on the service of the service , which is a human being in the average , which is a human being in the cost of the service , which is
so let 's look at each factor of one factor , and we think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come to zero .
now , this is basic algebra , but let 's go through .
first , we have the population .
today , there 's a billion people .
and it 's on nine billion to go on the nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , we could lower 10 percent to 15 percent , but we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that 's all of the food that we eat , clothing , <unk> , heating .
these are very good things , and they mean , `` <unk> , this services are moving to each other on the planet .
it 's great that this number is going to go .
in the rich world , the upper billion , we could have been able to be able to make a <unk> and less use , but in the average , that number is going to be going to double each year and double the number of
so here 's a very basic service . there 's the light on the light so you can read the homework .
and these students did n't have it , so they go out , and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally good news .
we have something that does n't go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , by other ways , by new ways , in the <unk> , there are many services , which is a lot of food , to be <unk> 90 percent .
in other service , how the manufacturing process of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , is very much more very much .
by the whole , if we 're optimistic , maybe we 'll get a reduction for a factor , or maybe even have a factor .
but the first three factors , we 've got over 26 billion billion tons , and it 's not just out .
so let 's look at the fourth factor , and this is going to be a <unk> -- this is the amount of co2 , which is a <unk> .
it turns out , it 's the question , you can get to zero .
when you burn coal , no .
when you burn natural gas , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity today today , except the renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do is to create a global level , is a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i do the term , `` wonders , i do n't do that .
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people have contributed to the evolution of many of these wonders .
typically there 's no <unk> , you need a miracle to a particular date .
you 're just like that , you 're just going to come back and some of them , not .
but in this case , we have to give up and give up a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked me how can i really get this really <unk> ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration , which is the idea of the people on the people of the people ?
i was reminded me at last year when i brought the <unk> and somehow liked the people who were doing .
the idea was really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know that there are people who are living in the way that are living with mosquitos .
for energy , i was one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you have to give me that you ca n't bite you . actually , you 're not going to leave you the glass .
well , there 's all kinds of <unk> like these , but they do n't all get much .
we need solutions , either one or several thousand <unk> , and even though there are many directions , which are there , are there , in which people are looking for , i 'm looking at five , i 'm really just five , which is a lot of them , which is
i have declined , <unk> , merger and biofuels .
and you might afford a <unk> contribution and if you expect to get better than i expect , it 's great , but my boss here is that we have to give all these five work , and we ca n't give up of them because they 're going to give us all of us , because all of us have
let 's look at the burn fossil fuels , it 's like the coal of the coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is , maybe it 's easy , but it 's not . you have to be the co2 that comes from the burning of the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and hope that there remains there .
there 's some <unk> , which is the <unk> of a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it 's going to get 100 percent of the co2 , is a big challenge , but the largest problem is the <unk> .
who is going to make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally has a lot of billions of a lot larger than any kind of junk you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a hard <unk> .
next , we 're going to go .
the <unk> are three big problems . the cost of countries , are in <unk> countries , which is to be high , which is the question of being really wrong , despite the human genome that 's not being used for weapons .
and what do you do with the junk ?
because even though he 's not very large , there 's a lot of consider .
so three difficult problems that might be soluble , and that 's why you should work .
the last three of five one i 've summarized .
it 's the renewables , as you 're often called a lot .
and even the have -- although it 's great , they 're not really need a fuel -- you have some <unk> .
one is the <unk> that these technologies are growing low as much as the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , a thousand place as a normal power .
and then these vents are <unk> .
the sun seems not the whole day , they also does n't seem to be every day and as you do n't even get the wind up .
so you have to have to get out of these vents , when you have to get a way to get a way to get the energy in times when they do n't have available to it .
so there 's big <unk> . there 's challenges in the transmission . if we say , if you say , if we say , is that the power of the country is , you do n't have to be the technology that you have to deal with the risk of where the ground is from where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way of where the way
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i 've all kinds of batteries , which are made , the computer , mobile phone , <unk> , <unk> , which is , and i 've got out of the electronic energy , which is that the world is , so that all batteries we are producing , so all the batteries we are producing , so that all batteries we can produce , so all batteries and so that all the batteries we can produce , less than 10 minutes ,
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be 100 better than the marketers are time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
and that happens when you try to do this , these <unk> vents are about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest .
when you want to have 100 percent of it , you need a incredible <unk> .
now , where do we go , what is the right thing ?
one `` manhattan project ? how do we go to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of firms that work in it . hundreds of thousands .
in each of these five areas we need 100 people .
in many , you 'll say , `` these are crazy ! that 's good .
i think there 's a lot of the ted group there are many , who are already engaged there .
bill 's big firms , under one of a <unk> called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are investing in dozens companies making the great things and have interesting opportunities and i 'm trying to support that .
nathan <unk> and i suppose a company , who might be <unk> to the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; exchange , <unk> .
the development has been in this industry , some time , so it 's not a big surprise that some good concepts around .
the <unk> means that instead of the <unk> , which is a part of the <unk> , which is a percent , which is the <unk> , we decided to burn 99 percent , the <unk> .
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it , but you could n't really simulate a reasonable simulate , whether it would work , but it 's modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , yes , yes , yes , yes , yes , it 's so far as well .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it 's a lot more better .
in fact , you burn the junk , and you can even use the waste of these reactors as a <unk> .
instead of <unk> , you burn it . a great thing .
it 's a <unk> value , a little bit like a candle .
you see that there 's a kind of <unk> , often often , <unk> wave , `` <unk> . ''
the enemy really is the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that 's 99 percent . you have the part of it , so it 's called <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> u.s. national year ,
and when you 're cheap , and they 're just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's a example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let 's think about how we should measure our success .
how should our statement look like ?
well , let 's go to the target we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many of a 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it 's really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be generated in poor countries , and still there 's still a little bit agriculture . hopefully , hopefully , <unk> and cement is going to be clean down .
so to get these 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other note says , if we use the <unk> technology , whether it 's in all developed countries , and we 're on the path to get them to the rest .
this is great important .
this is going to be a shift change in this <unk> .
when we go back to there , how to be reflected in the 2020 ?
it should be the two elements .
we should use the <unk> use to get to reduce the resources to the way . the less we <unk> , the lower is being the <unk> and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note is the note that we do n't have companies that do n't completely completely <unk> to the great <unk> , just a little bit , or even something less important , which is less important to the <unk> of the innovation to the breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs have to track us with <unk> and we can measure it : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are a lot of great books in this topic .
the al gore called the choice and david <unk> <unk> <unk> , `` the <unk> air in the <unk> air . ''
they 're really going to go through and create a frame , where this is a picture of a wide , because we need to support for all sides .
there 's a couple of thing that needs to come together .
that 's a wish .
a very <unk> wish we invent this technology .
if you 're just a desire for me , you know , i could choose a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose a <unk> , and the love i would choose , or i could choose this desire , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , and that 's a wish i would take .
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get these wish that we 're going to have a pair of the survival of the long , and not a lot of people are terrible between the united states between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and all of these lives are very much less .
so what do we need to do ?
for what the systems i do ?
we need to use it for more .
when countries are doing in places like <unk> , you do n't just talk about co2 .
you should talk to these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous tiny money that are going to be spent for this innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 control , <unk> <unk> trade , trade trade , and we create something that 's going to be a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to go to the <unk> and whole whole , and also the things that will be done by the government .
it 's a important wish , but i think we can get it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand <unk> something better -- first , you can give us a idea of scale of scale of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , which is all great scientists , and we 've just put some 10 million . and even if we have tested our materials in a russian reactor , you just do it in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is that the building is the first <unk> , more billion , which is the ground in fact , actually , the ground of the first of it .
once the first thing is , when he 's going to be like this , everything is quite clear , because the economy that 's so much as much as we know .
so to understand the right thing , which is a vertical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , this used to <unk> this system and then it starts to go up and then it 's going to go down to the bottom ?
bg : exactly . now you have to be . now you have to be new into the reactor , so there 's a lot of people and many controls , and many controls , that 's the thing that you go wrong , and this thing you get to open and things that 's going to be open and do n't . that 's not good .
but if you have a low-cost fuel , you can use it in 60 years -- think of a pillar -- you bury them in the whole <unk> .
and it 's there and <unk> 60 years , and then it 's done .
a <unk> , who itself is a solution to the waste .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the waste is : you can sit there -- there 's much less waste , and then you take it in the next thing , and it 's going to go out it .
and we start by looking at the garbage who already exists in this <unk> or <unk> of them , and that 's our <unk> .
so , what 's what you have to do is a problem , which is what we put in our fill and it 's been reduced to the <unk> , the <unk> movement .
but while they talked about these world about the world ,
where is the most important interest , what really do ?
bg : now we have n't <unk> a place , and there 's a lot of interesting things for all the names . it 's big interest , and the people of the company were in russia , india , china , and i 've met the minister of the energy and talked about how to fit in the aging , and
i 'm optimistic . you know , you know , the french and japanese and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a flavor of a thing that has been done .
this is a important step ahead , but it 's like a faster , and some countries have this built built , so everyone 's done is a little bit of a little bit of precious , a <unk> thing to our first .
in your idea : <unk> and probability really are actually going to call your life ?
bg : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent 20 years .
this is the <unk> that we 've introduced us to see the <unk> , which we have to have to do .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is doing good , and that 's a big wish that could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of firms , and we need hundreds of these things that work , if their work work , that 's the way that work for their channel , for example , to make it .
and it would be the best if there 's a lot of these , because you could use a mixture of it .
and there 's a solution .
are the great possible breakthroughs , is this the largest thing you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it 's not as a <unk> , but it 's not the power of it .
there are other innovative companies .
you know , we know , and we know , it 's not how to do it as good as these , but there 's the <unk> way , that 's another approach .
there 's a texture <unk> , which seems something hard , but maybe the tell us about us .
and so there 's different , but the nice thing is that a <unk> of a million times more energy , and so , if you can deal with the problems , the radiation , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the footprint and the cost , the footprint and the cost , the footprint and the cost , and the cost of the country , and other things , the impact , and other things , the impact , and other things , the impact , and other things , the impact , and other things , the impact , and other things , the impact , and other things ,
if that does n't work what ?
have we have to be able to be square to try to think the <unk> <unk> ?
bg : if you get in this situation , it 's like too much , and you 'll be a heart attack , what you do is , you might need to do it ?
there 's a <unk> <unk> that 's called <unk> , which is in the way of scale , to be <unk> warming , so we had 20 or 30 years to be taken us .
this is just one <unk> .
you 're not to do that we do n't need that .
some people say , you do n't mean to work on insurance 's insurance 's law because you might be lazy because you 're going to be lazy and make it on , because you know that a <unk> will be save .
i do n't know if you 're smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there 's a funny thing in <unk> , whether you should have the things that 's going to be faster , or this innovation we need to have more than we expect .
<unk> : have you have a or two sentences for the ones to persuade you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , life live in very different types .
the scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there 's negative impact that have the clouds to do things ?
there 's very , very few things that you can tell you , and there 's a chance of a million .
the <unk> here is so similar to aids .
you do it a mistake now , and you pay very much later .
and so the idea of all , now , if you all have all kinds of <unk> problems , in something that 's only one thing that you 've got to see , which is that the investment is not so obvious , and in fact , the ipcc report in the rich world , and it 's going to look at the worst of the world , which is n't going to look at all right and say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about .
but my dream here is , if you do it , and at the same time , the atmosphere can do , and then the skeptics are also saying , `` okay , i 'm not interested in the atmosphere , i 'm not interested in the ground , i 'm not interested in the ground , i wish it 's not sure it would be able to accept it , but i 'll probably accept it as it 's cheaper than the previous method . ''
and that would be the answer to the <unk> point of the <unk> argument that if you use all these time and energy , the co2 's energy , the other goals is suffering from malaria , the <unk> , the <unk> , that 's going to invest in the basis of resources , and that 's the better things that we can do better things that we can do better .
bg : now , the real spending for research -- say , the u.s. spending have to spend 10 billion per year than you do today -- that 's not so dramatic .
there 's no way to suffer from other things .
you get too large <unk> , and so you can not disagree with something that is not that , and it 's trying to finance this . for me to work on me here in me .
it 's because you 're very quickly , and funded by the <unk> learning process , and i think we should have more things that have more things that have the potential to be a lot of cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get a very high school teacher , just to keep the rich <unk> .
i mean , each of us here could be five times so much for our energy without changing his lifestyle .
but the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even the <unk> is thinking .
his new <unk> is now , `` why will not have to talk about the research ? ''
he 's still still , because of his early stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that it 's a very low group , and so he 's going to be the <unk> .
and this is a line i think of is appropriate .
the research , it 's just crazy as a little bit .
bill , i think i 'm telling all of all people , if i say , i really hope that you 'll hope that your desire will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , there 's a ted conference , peter <unk> called <unk> , called `` the <unk> . ''
the idea is quite simple . <unk> need to be a <unk> structure , and we have to build 20 <unk> , ca n't come and <unk> <unk> tape , and you can build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , even though it 's really easy , it 's actually really hard to work on , because it 's working on the way , really work with work .
and so i thought that this is a interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since since i 've done about 70 workshops in the world , i 've done , with students , <unk> , and architects , even with <unk> of the <unk> and there 's something to the point of what deep space in the world 's work is to share with
they usually start to <unk> the people in the task .
you talk about how it 's looking at how it 's going to be , you know , it 's power .
then they invest in planning and organization , and they came and put it out .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> environment , and they 're developing the environment .
and eventually , before you have no time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and they put it gently on the top , and `` <unk> ! ' they call her work .
but then , what 's still happened is that the `` <unk> '' is being <unk> , because the weight of the <unk> does that all the thing is and <unk> .
there 's a number of people who have a lot more <unk> , <unk> , and under worst , there are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused and they 're really confused and producing really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> , and the best of the <unk> <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
as peter , peter told us not just do the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how is this ? what ? what is with that ?
and peter 's telling : no one of the children are going to be in time to be time in the <unk> of the <unk> .
they do n't invest in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that 's the <unk> were engaged , to find a real plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you do n't have time more and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> is doing is that they start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , and that they 're going to get up with the marshmallow , so that they 're <unk> to repair the possibility of <unk> prototypes .
and , <unk> , these kind of collaboration is as a core of a <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids get <unk> and what does n't work .
so performance is working with prototypes , but we see , see how different teams are doing .
the average for most of the average is about <unk> , <unk> , provide half of them , are more of lawyers are more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they 're understanding , and we 're using geometric geometric patterns to build the key to stable structures .
ceos are about average . but there 's interesting .
you get an <unk> <unk> , you 'll be able to be significant better .
it 's unbelievable . you see and see , `` this team is going to win . ''
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they 're leading the process , you understand him .
and this team that regulates their bodies and on the work is , is significant to the <unk> of the team of the team .
and to make a difference and <unk> and the combination of success .
when you have 10 teams who have a typical system , you get about six , which have robust structures .
now i tried a little bit more exciting .
i thought we were going to get the <unk> .
so i got a <unk> $ <unk> for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if you did n't have a <unk> high school , he would have worn off the price of it .
so is it not interesting that high , a strong effect have a strong effect ?
we repeated these exercise with the same students .
now , what do you think ?
now , you understand the advantage of the <unk> .
so , this was the same way of the same , bad team of a under the best .
they 're produced the highest construction in the least of the time .
so there 's been <unk> lessons for us , and it 's about the power of it , and success .
you might like , why would anyone actually invest in a way to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i 'm <unk> digital tools and processes to help help the team , and we 're designing cars , video games , `` <unk> <unk> . ''
and what the <unk> is doing is , they helps to identify them remotely protein .
because open , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is , a common experience , a common language , and a common language , and they 're building the right piece of machine .
and this is the value of this experience that simple exercise .
and those of them , who are interested in , can be <unk> .
it 's a blog where you see how you build the <unk> .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples from all world , like people the system are hawking and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think that 's the construction of a <unk> sports .
it 's going to be all the senses that we 're all our senses on the task , and we 're using our thinking , how we need to be able to have our feelings and our things , in the challenge , the challenge .
and sometimes a little prototype of these experience is everything it takes us to get a `` <unk> '' moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so , we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
and you can go in the past , you can go in the future ; you can go in here and you ca n't remain in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i 'd like my friends in last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to come back in time before , or it was to be a lot of twitter or `` america , ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of just find out to nostalgia recognition .
and that 's what i do .
i 'm not part of these group , i need to say .
i do n't want to be in the past , and not because i am a study .
it 's because the possibility of the planet is not going back to go ahead and go ahead .
so i want to go in this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most successful time that there was on this planet , no matter what 's scale you do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , opportunities , opportunities , opportunities .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> had died of 60 times .
my grandparents ' shoes were these number of 70 .
my parents are the 80 in turkey .
so , there 's better at a nine at the start with my <unk> .
but it 's not even people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a kid who is born in new delhi is going to live in a living room , so long as the richest man on the world , a hundred years ago .
think about it . that 's an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox had been <unk> billion people in this planet .
you 've got the demographics of the earth in a way , how it does n't have war .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we 've got them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases that are not a million of us only have a generation of the generation of the generation , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody know , anybody who is ?
so , we can be able to have modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people who are the aid of science technology .
and from my view , the scientific method is , to try and look , whether it works if it does n't do it , one of the great risk of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , this is all good news , because there 's a couple of problems , and they 've been talking about it .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world , go hungry to bed to bed .
this number is going to go , and they go very quickly , and that 's an <unk> .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to celebrate the world , the world 's existing .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , oil , gas , it 's going to be , soon , and then , soon , we do n't get out of this chaos , we disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food , that will be more than the billion people , without the country you live in .
i think we can force these world with energy , and it 's the world that do n't get destroyed it .
i think that 's really , and no , that 's not a wishful wishful wishful argument .
but this is me telling me at night -- one of the things that i think i 've never had a lot of , we 've never had a science progress in the way that we were never meant to how now , i 've never been
and we 've never been able to be able to make it in the same way of doing it , like we can do it .
we 're in the threshold of astonishing , amazing events on many areas , and yet , i really think we have hundreds of , 300 years ago , the <unk> , to find that education , in which we have progress in the way we have been doing is that we have to have this kind of thing that we have to have over these things that are <unk>
people <unk> themselves in their faith , and that 's so deeply that you ca n't release them .
not even the truth is it going to be free .
and you hear , everyone has a right on his opinion , even a right on its opinion , in the opinion .
but you know what you do n't have n't right ?
you do n't have a fairly on your own facts . <unk> , you do n't .
and i needed a while to find out that .
a decade ago , i wrote a article about vaccination to the new yorker , a little paper .
and i was amazed at the <unk> , too , to the <unk> of what the most effective thing in health in the history of humanity is .
i did n't know what i should do , so i did just do what i 'm going to do , i wrote a article and ran on .
and soon , soon i wrote a article about <unk> changed .
same thing , it 's a bigger thing .
people were crazy .
so i also wrote a article , and i could n't understand why people thought that would be `` <unk> , '' why they believed that molecules in a particular rather than a random kind of <unk> in nature .
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i was writing the article i 've done .
i mean , i am journalist .
we call it , we 're eating food that 's okay .
but these papers made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it out .
and that 's because that <unk> were doing me crazy , and i did n't really have a <unk> .
these were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that 's been the disturbing ...
but then i thought , you know what , are we ,
we have a point where we do n't have the same relationship to progress in the progress of how to be used .
we talk about <unk> .
we talk ironic , with little <unk> , it 's called progress .
okay , there 's reasons why , and i think of what reasons are .
we 've got the trust in institutions in the institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of science , and there 's no reason why not should be so .
you can call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weapons , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they were always quite a very , so they were skeptical .
ask you ask , claim you , the evidence , require evidence .
do n't have a given one .
but now , you 're going to get here , if you have to find evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we 're not good at it .
and i can say that in the reason that we 're now in a epidemic of fear , how i never saw them , and hopefully soon end up .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that was <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
a lot of studies have been done to see whether it was true .
a lot of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no correlation , no connections , no connections , no connections .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't power because we believe in excitement , we believe what we see to see what 's going to be really feel .
we do n't believe in a hundred of documents from a <unk> , who is data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was <unk> .
and so , because of the fact , the u.s. is one of the only country in the world where the neurological increase in the world , is that immunization is <unk> .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed of it .
it 's awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . this is what i do .
because anybody here , there 's somebody who have ?
did a single one in the audience ever see someone in the audience ?
it 's not really often .
in this country , not in the world , but 160,000 times in the world .
these are a lot of death from <unk> , 20 pounds .
but because this is not here , we can be an urban <unk> , and people like <unk> <unk> are <unk> and <unk> from <unk> and <unk> king and larry king live .
and that can do you because they do n't get cause and correlation .
they do n't understand that these things are actually going to be too much , but almost never ever be the same .
and that 's something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he 's <unk> of one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle , there 's not so much .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he 's just a <unk> in a different other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 kids in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
now , this is good , besides that paul <unk> and says , and say how hard you are , and that people would just stop in the <unk> .
and that 's actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public language , he ca n't tell you without armed .
he gets to go home , because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul did a <unk> .
i do n't need that , but we have a lot of <unk> .
you get it up , you go back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and that 's going on .
we 've got in this country now .
and that 's going to be worse , and quite soon , children will dying over and that 's just one question of numbers .
and they 're not just dying in <unk> .
what about <unk> ? do we do that . why not ?
a <unk> of mine wrote a few weeks ago , and you say , i think i think i 'm a little bit more .
nobody said that before .
she would not be their kid to <unk> . it 's not a case .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country .
now , i do n't know , i do n't know somebody in lagos , and there 's a plane , and then it 's going to los angeles , and it 's about a ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and it 's going to come on long beach , and it will come to a whole <unk> of the night .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a <unk> disease , and we know that , because it 's not the world the world works .
this is the planet that we live . do n't do it as if he 's not .
we love it to lie . we love this .
have you all taken up tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , you 're going to be able to get you on the leaps .
i know that they did this because half of americans are doing that every day .
you take the stuff , and you take alternative to the idea of cure , and it does n't make any difference , how many we find that they 're useless .
the data came back all the time .
they 're <unk> their urine . more they never never do .
this is okay , you want to do <unk> billion dollars to dark urine .
i get it completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> business .
we hate a strong government . we do n't trust the system .
and that 's not the way we should . our health system is <unk> .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely cool and <unk> themselves to us that it can afford .
so we 're going to go away from the way , and where do we go ?
we 're going to go in the poor , the poor age .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really serious a serious thing , because this stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i 've all been all kinds of things here .
no one -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because i do n't even know what that 's , but we give billions of dollars for it , it 's been <unk> .
and you know what ? if i say that , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , i would say , ``
you know , you know , you feel good . ''
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
because it does n't care whether it 's the minister of the minister , it 's the time says , `` hmm , i 'm going to choose the evidence of my experts not have to attack the evidence of mammography , '' or some <unk> , who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
when you get out on this path where and magic and magic to replace the things , and science , you get to a place where they do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 400,000 his people to be because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> drugs are much more effectively than the <unk> of drugs we can know that they can slow down the way of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than each other disease .
do n't tell me that these things do n't have the consequences .
they have . they 've got .
now , the <unk> epidemic , in which we 're just right now is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> food , and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . you have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , each branch , every <unk> , has changed from people .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden .
there was no <unk> .
there was no first time . we did this all .
we 've done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them has work and not .
we 're broke , what did n't work .
now we can do it , and of course , there 's risk . but we can do something like to be a <unk> , and of course , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , millions of people .
do n't you want to do that ?
i have to say that i do n't understand that .
we reject <unk> food , and we 're going to get changed .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is , many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we do n't want to have huge fields with a thing that is wrong .
we do n't want to <unk> companies .
we do n't want to do that companies have seeds .
and you know what my answer is in all ?
yeah , you have right . we 're right . we 're going to do that .
it 's true , we have a huge amount of <unk> , but that 's not science .
that 's not something to do with science .
it 's fairly , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it 's actually work , but it 's not , but the idea that we should n't allow science , because we 're scared , because we 're a real dead , and she 's not going to be millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to grow 70 percent more food than currently .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
marcus : a <unk> .
you need this , and we do n't give them .
and why ? <unk> change food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like , for example .
<unk> is something that 's half a billion people .
it 's like a potato .
it 's just a handful of calories . it 's <unk> .
it 's no nutrients , it 's not a protein , and scientists just build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food and would n't be blind .
you would n't starve , and you know what ?
it would be nice . it would n't be <unk> <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , you ask , why do n't fight this ?
because we do n't want to <unk> genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not all chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our own <unk> , our food , better food , to be unique food .
it 's not about rice <unk> , it 's about getting people to get people who is alive , and it 's highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do that , if we 're doing so much of a good , we do n't have a guilty that i think , not good , high-tech diet , high-tech diet .
there is no other description of what 's happening here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not worthy , and we have to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , `` do you want to go in this ridiculous time and in the future ? ''
everyone 's . i want to be a case .
in the moment , they 're in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this time card , and we want to do anything .
we can <unk> them , where we want them to be <unk> , and we 're going to move them to where we want .
we have to have this conversation , and we need to think , but if we 're going to go into the time period , and we 'll be happy in the future , we 're happy to have this .
i know that we can , and so far as it 's about it , what 's something that is going to be what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
and for some time , i 've been interested in the <unk> , and it might seem to be strange , that 's because it 's true to it , it 's because i think it 's like , as i think , as i think , as i think , as i think , a deception that will be really important when someone believes in something that you only believe in it .
in other words , <unk> , a measurable effect , which is a measurable effect , which is , the <unk> , which is that , and that 's just because the person is , is a <unk> or a kind of a kind of -- for example , is a kind of -- for example , is that the patient believes in the body , which is a measurable effect in the body , which is
a deception is going to be a real thing , because someone is like this .
so we can also understand each other , i want to understand a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i 'll show you how he works . this is a trick who has at least for the 1950s in each <unk> for kids .
i 've had to learn it magic magic magic of the <unk> <unk> .
i 'll do it for you and explain .
and then i 'll explain why i 'm explaining him .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand you can study .
i 'll just get that <unk> in my hand .
i 'm going to leave my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing goes down , or from him , i 'll just get my wrist on this wrist here .
so , in this way , you can see that there 's no time in life . as long as i 'm going to <unk> here , nothing can come up or get out there .
and the goal is quite simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is all right , it 's going to be <unk> by my naked physical <unk> .
it 's actually so unpredictable in his place , i can do it , without that <unk> <unk> .
nothing goes in my sleeve or there 's no <unk> , and you can look at all .
yay !
now , this is a trick i often <unk> little kids , which is really interested in magic , because you can learn a lot of deception when you look at a very little bit , if you 're looking at a very simple trick .
probably many of you here are there in the room , this trick .
so , he 's the way it works .
i think that 's the knife in my hand .
i say that i 'm going to <unk> my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , and then it 's a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist , is that the real secret of illusion is .
and in the moment , where i 'm going to <unk> my hand , so you see it from the back , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position , in a position , in the location , in the location .
amazing trick ?
there 's somebody who was not a kid who had no childhood .
so , there 's here . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , the fingers changes its position .
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't see , you know , there 's just three fingers : because the brain function is , they do n't know , one , one , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
but that 's not what i 'm not here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it 's going to be there , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , which is now there .
and if i 'm going to leave my hand , the same thing , the same thing , i would get up , by looking at this movement , hidden out that the fingers are <unk> .
i take these hand away . and here 's the knife .
this trick is , you can show your friends and the neighbors . thank you .
now , what did the <unk> do to do with the <unk> ?
a year or so , i read a study that really did really have been really focused on .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so that was a amazing thing .
so , this turned out , it turns out , when you provide a <unk> in a white pill , in a <unk> , that 's just a round , white pill , which has a particular measurable effect .
but if you get the shape , you know , in a smaller pill , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue <unk> and a letters that 's actually more effectively .
and that , even though no <unk> -- it 's just <unk> .
but one white pill is not so good as a blue pill .
what ? i was really mad .
but it turns out , it 's not all that .
when you take a <unk> , the more effective , it 's more effective than pills .
a colored capsule , which is yellow and the other red is better than one white capsule .
the <unk> is a role .
one pill to be a day in a day , not so much as three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact statistics . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is , is , ...
... that 's a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab the needle .
right ? one syringe with a <unk> -- a <unk> of a <unk> substance , which you 're going to be a patient .
this is a very strong image in your head . that 's much stronger than one white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm showing you -- i 'll show you another one , if we have a <unk> .
so , the fact is that the white pill does n't be so good like the blue pill , which is not so much as good as a capsule that does n't make it as well .
and nothing is actually a really <unk> quality . it 's just our belief that they have to make a stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i suppose something obvious , obviously , it 's a deception , and it 's going to be really a real look .
we know , yes , we have to grasp the needle when it 's supposed to go .
this is a 18 inches of a long time . she 's very , very , very , very , very <unk> . and i 'll first put it a little bit very low .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> <unk> .
this is my skin . that 's not a <unk> from hollywood .
i 'm going to get these needle in my skin , and they go through it , until they go back to the other side of the other side .
if you 're bad , if you fall , you know , if you fall in a little bit of <unk> -- i 've got this one couple of friends in the hotel room , and some people who did n't know , and then one woman 's almost <unk> .
so i 'm going to show you , if you 're being a kid , you 'll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , what , i 'm going to do the first <unk> part of this .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also see , but you can also want to do it as well , if you want .
so , it 's so right here , right here , where my meat starts to look at the lower part of my <unk> , i 'll just make a little bit of a little bit .
do i 'm really happy . does it crazy ?
and now , just a little bit of my skin and on the other side of the other hand , and so again .
now we 're actually in the same situation we had in the <unk> .
it 's about .
but now you ca n't count my finger , right ?
so , i 'll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes ,
i know what people think if you see this .
you say , `` okay , that 's probably not so stupid and <unk> itself , '' just to entertain us a few minutes . ''
well , i 'm going to show you .
how this looks like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people say , `` okay . i do n't see that . ''
the people in the <unk> are going to be in .
let me show you about it .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can <unk> it .
i 'm sorry . if you 're going to be a bad kid , look at the way , look at all .
the back or the ones who looks later in video later , you 'll say , `` well , this is quite impressive , but if it 's real , you would see , here 's a hole and there , if it would be really , ''
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yes , there 's it .
now , usually i would have the needle and then .
i would show you my arm , and you know , there is no wounds .
but i think in this context here and with the intention of a deception , i 'm going to make a funny thing , i 'll just go to the needle and go and so from the stage .
we 're going to have a few times more in the next days .
i hope you 're looking at it . thank you very much .
everyone talks about the happiness .
i 've never add some people who have the number of books in the age of the <unk> in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in
there 's a big wave of interest in happiness .
there 's a lot of <unk> .
everyone would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide , there are several cognitive quality , which are very basic , which is all impossible to think of happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by these cognitive fall .
this applies to <unk> , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it 's true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so disturbing how everyone else is like everyone .
the first of these fall fall , is a <unk> , complexity to admit .
it turns out that the word `` good word is not a useful word , because we apply it in a lot of different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning , which we could have to limit on the limit , but in the big and all of all , that 's something we have to give up , and we 'll have to give the complicated perspective on what is
the second trap is , and memory is , and memory is basically , you basically have his life in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two different concepts , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's the <unk> of the fact that we ca n't think about a situation that affects well-being without being opposite .
i mean , that 's a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now i 'd like to begin with a example of someone who had a <unk> , which is a story , and [ unclear ] he said he was a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and there was a <unk> sound .
and then he added to the <unk> , really emotional experience , which has been completely transformed .
but that did n't .
what it had been ruined by the experience of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music , and he had a lot of music .
she did n't <unk> , because he was the memory with <unk> ; the memory was ruined , and memory was all of what he had to keep it .
what really says that is that we might think about and other people might think about two ways of ourselves .
there 's a <unk> self who lives in the present and the present thing that lives in the present time , and basically the past , but basically , the present .
it 's the <unk> self , which is the doctor 's doctor -- you know , `` the doctor asks , `` do it hurts if i 'm going to <unk> it ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself , the <unk> and the story of our lives , and it 's the doctor 's doctor by making the question , `` how did you feel like this , `` how did you feel like this ? ''
or `` how did their journey come to albania ? '' or so similar .
these are two very different units , which is the <unk> themselves , and the <unk> themselves , and the two of the two things are part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that 's really what i think is a very basic response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we do n't tell you all stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we 're looking at from our own <unk> are still a story .
and let 's start with a example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who are <unk> in a painful .
i 'm not going to go into detail . it 's not more painful , but it was painful as these trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds to report .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask , `` who 's got more organized ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b has been <unk> . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that had a patient , and more .
but now there 's another question : how very these patients thought they were <unk> ?
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient 's a lot of a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is , how they ends .
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this obvious thing ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse is , when the pain was quite a <unk> on his peak . it 's a very bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we 've been asked that people asked to ask for their <unk> , and then , like , how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a as a as a <unk> in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the point of view of the <unk> itself , it clearly had an <unk> time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we actually have clinical trials , and it 's made , and it 's made , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , you could actually be able to make the <unk> to <unk> the hose without <unk> him without <unk>
that 's going to be the patient , but just a little bit , and much less than before .
and if you 've done a few minutes , you did n't have a bad word , and you 've got to be a bad word , and you did n't have a lot of your own patient 's better , because you 've given your patient to be a better story about his experience .
what is a story ?
and that 's true of the stories that the memory is to give us and also it 's true for the stories that we invent .
so , what a story is , and there 's <unk> , great moments and end .
end is very , very , very important , and in this case , in this case , the end of the end .
well , the <unk> self lives all lives .
it 's a few times of the <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to this moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most of our days of our life -- and i 've done this -- you know , the psychological present in the world , you know , you know , about 600 million of them . there 's about 1,500 million of them . most of you are not
most of you are completely ignored from the <unk> itself .
and they 're going to get the impression that you should have count that what happened in the period of the <unk> life expectancy .
it 's the quality of resource that we use in this world .
and as we use them , but that 's not the story that makes the most popular self in the face .
so we have the <unk> themselves and the <unk> themselves , and they 're really quite different .
the largest difference between you is the most of time .
from the point of the <unk> self , when you have a vacation and the second week , the first week is exactly how the first week is as good , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as a <unk> vacation .
that does n't work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> vacation is not much more than a mentally holiday , because there 's no new memories to get a new memory .
they did n't change the story .
and in this way , the critical variable , which is a <unk> of different danger itself , and time , has a little bit more impact on this story .
now , the <unk> themselves are more than remember and tell stories .
it 's actually one of the one that makes the decisions , because if you have a patient who had two <unk> in two different surgeons , and you decides that the <unk> who 's going to the memory that 's less bad and that 's the surgeon that 's been selected .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this election .
we do n't elect between these <unk> . we choose between the memory of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't normally think of our future .
we think about our future , memory .
and in the way , you can look at , you know , when you do n't know , as a tyranny of the <unk> themselves , and you can think of the <unk> themselves as a , which is the <unk> of the <unk> themselves , the <unk> themselves , the <unk> themselves , the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we 're going to get vacation a lot of the case , that 's what 's going to be mentally mentally <unk> in the services of suffering .
and that 's a little bit difficult to justify , i think .
i mean , how very <unk> we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that gave us to provide for the dominance of the <unk> .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation , which we 've done in antarctica , which is clearly the best vacation i 've ever had , and i think i think in the relationship , i think about how often i think about other <unk> .
and i probably probably had a memory of these <unk> journey , i would say about 25,000 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i 've ever opened the folder , i 've had spent a <unk> back in 600 images i had a more lesson .
well , these are three weeks , and these are the one one a half a year for a second .
there 's a toothbrush .
well , i like a little bit very much , you know , how little <unk> , i have to do things like , but even if you do it a real question , why do we give you the obvious weight in the <unk> , which we give
so i want to think you want to think about a thought of thought of thought .
imagine your next square , you know that the end of the <unk> are all of your images , and they get a <unk> drug , so they 're not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose another inch , there 's a conflict between your two ways of self , and you have to think about how conflict do n't , and that 's really obvious , because if you think of time , you think of time , you think , and if you think of the senses of memory , you could have a different answer .
why we choose the <unk> , which we 're calling is a problem that is a choice of choice between the two ways of self .
now , the two ways of self is going to be able to be two terms of happiness .
there are two concepts of concepts that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask , how happy is the most popular self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments of the life of the <unk> themselves ?
and they 're all -- lucky for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and , we 're now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the <unk> of the <unk> of the time .
when you ask for the happiness of the <unk> , it 's a very different thing .
that 's not how happy a person alive .
it 's how happy or <unk> the person is , if these person 's person think about her life .
very different concept .
everyone who do n't be different to these terms of being happy , and i am not one of a lot of researchers that have been a lot of security , who have been the study of happiness .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self and happiness of the <unk> itself has been found in the last few years , and now you 're going to be trying to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , where more than a half million people have been asked about a million people have been thinking about what they think about her life and over their experiences , and there were other efforts to make .
so the last few years , we started talking about the happiness of the two kinds of different kinds of themselves .
and the main reasons that we have , i think , is that they 're really different .
you can know how to be happy with his life , and teach them not much about how happy he lives alive and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation , which is linked to gravity .
what is that means that if you would meet someone and you would say you , oh , his father 's <unk> , how much is you know about the size ?
now , you would have something about your scale , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone 's life has a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so correlation is tiny .
we know something that 's being a little bit of <unk> .
we know that money is very important , and we know , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is being being engaged with people who are going to spend time , to spend time , people who like .
there 's other delight , but that 's really fun .
so if you 're lucky to maximize , you 're going to be able to do a very different things .
and the conclusion from what i said is that we 're not going to be lucky to imagine , is not to imagine a label of well-being for well-being .
it 's a completely different word .
well , very soon , a different reason that we ca n't realize about happiness is that we do n't think about the same things , if we think about life and actually , if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , you 're not going to get the correct answer .
if you think , if you think that the question is that people have to be happier in california , if you have , we say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we have to be in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it 's not even important to the <unk> self , decides that are happy .
but , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can take a <unk> of the end of california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track of what happens to people who are going to go to california , happier .
well , you 're not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you 're going to think you are happier , because if you 're going to think about it , you know , you 're going to think about how many of the weather is in ohio , and they 're going to get the right decision .
it 's very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we first sent a few weeks ago , you know , you 've got to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this <unk> survey .
is that what you can do is to give us because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : safe .
i think i think the most interesting outcomes we 've found in the <unk> survey is a number that we had absolutely not been being found in .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the <unk> itself .
when we looked at how emotion is to <unk> .
and it turns out that under 60,000 dollars in america , americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 20,000 , but it 's a big representative sample of 400 dollars in parallel dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they 'll be more happy , the poorer , you 'll be a lot of the world .
and we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not a <unk> , but that lack of money , is certainly not to raise , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve , you 're a lot of music , you 're making .
it 's not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american development , it 's about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take these insights seriously , i mean , it seems to be all in the head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians would be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
dk : you know , i think there 's no evidence that there is a <unk> of the role in the political .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , they 're going to happen and in other countries .
people are , to realize that they should be good at happiness , if you think of policy .
it 's going to be a while , and the people are going to explore whether you want to study <unk> or whether you want to study <unk> , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
so how you 're lucky , very different from how you think , and whether you think of it and whether you think of the <unk> themselves , or whether you think of the <unk> themselves .
this is going to affect policy , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you 're <unk> to measure the population of the population .
this is , i think , in the next , i think , is a national conversation in the national world .
well , it seems to me , this is the subject , or should you have the most exciting political debate in the track of the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i make video games .
i think now , i think of it 's <unk> and my target is <unk> for 10 years , and the next decade is , it 's as easy to do it as easy to save the world in the reality , to save the world in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to persuade people , including all of all , more time with play and <unk> games .
now , we 're going to spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of you may think , `` this is a whole bunch of time for games . ''
perhaps a much time , if you think about how many problems we need to solve the real world in the real world .
but in my research , the research in the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive this next century on this planet , we need to increase the time in the time , we need to increase in the time .
i have a lot of <unk> that had a time of age 21 billion hours a week .
so , this looks at something that might first be a little bit more precise , so i think , so i think , so i think , if we 're going to do it : if we 're going to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global , global , and obesity , is we need to play with the next week for the end of the next decade
no , i mean , really seriously .
why ? this picture is quite exactly why i think that games are so important for survival of the human species in the future .
this is a tudor image of photographers <unk> .
he wanted to work with the emotions in play . so he has a camera in the players .
this is one of the classical expression of play .
if you 're not a player , you might not try to do some of the <unk> in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something , but also very much , very much concentration , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really difficult problems .
and if you play , you see some <unk> here , which are <unk> on top of the top and the mouths are a sign of optimism . the eyebrow the eyebrow .
this is a player who is at the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok , so , so we have some player here .
a <unk> victory is a result that has been so far positive , that they did n't know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you reach it , they shocked that they 're actually capable of being able to be able to be a <unk> victory .
this player is a short victory .
and this is what we have to see in millions of faces of the world if we take the <unk> of the next century , the face of the presence of all odds at the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the country in the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the country .
well , unfortunately , we see this face of the real life , if we face tough problems .
i call it as a `` living in life , '' and it 's really bad . and it 's actually my face , you see ? ok ? ok ?
this is me how i 'm a bad kid in life .
this is a graffiti in my former <unk> home in berkeley , california , in my phd of my phd , in my phd of my phd , in games are better than in games than in real life .
this is a problem that have a lot of players .
we think we 're not in reality as well as in games .
and i do n't just just have less successful , although that 's probably one .
we 're going to reach more . i mean , i mean , in terms of doing things in terms of motivation , to do something a <unk> , inspired by collaboration .
if we 're in a <unk> , i think many of us are going to turn us in our best version , anytime , and immediately , the problem is , the problem , we try to make it as long as well as it
and in reality , if we fail , if we get to obstacles , we 're often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> . we feel threatened , maybe it might be <unk> , maybe it might be frustrated , or <unk> , or <unk> .
these things never never have when we play games , there 's just not just not .
and that 's what i wanted to do as a <unk> .
why is it impossible to be impossible to think , you could n't get easy to do anything ?
how can we use these emotions into the reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , the ideal environment to the collaborative environment .
and i found some things that are possible in the epic <unk> in <unk> .
so , first , if you put in one of these <unk> , especially of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters who are willing to get to you , and that immediately immediately .
but not only a mission , but a mission , the perfect thing to fit your first level in the game , right ?
so , you create that .
they never get one task that you ca n't solve .
but still the edge of their capabilities , so you have to work in the ground . but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you 're not around and spin <unk> . there 's always a very specific thing to do something important .
and there are tons of workers .
where they go to , hundreds of people who work with them to work with their epic mission .
that 's what we have not just in the real life , this sense that 's willing to be willing to stand with a <unk> .
and also there 's these <unk> story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you 've got to be a level of the level , `` <unk> strength '' or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i did n't have a little bit , plus-one speech and plus-one crazy idea , crazy idea .
i do n't get in real life in the real life .
so the problem of the world 's <unk> like the world of warcraft is that so , there 's how to be so different , anytime you have a <unk> of a <unk> , in the edge of a <unk> , that we would rather have our whole time in these <unk> .
they 're just better than the reality .
until now , all the world of <unk> are working together to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
this is not a little bad thing .
it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context : a <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go to the <unk> .
so the first kind of <unk> <unk> .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we 're going to spend on play , is that it 's just to make sense of the time in terms of the human development in terms of what 's extraordinarily relevant .
but also , the way , because it turns out , because it turns out , by using these whole time , actually , what we 're doing is , what we are in the way we are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
we 're developing each other , you 're afraid ,
this is the truth . i think i think .
so , look at this interesting statistic , which recently published an amazing university of students in the carnegie university , the average boy of a country in a country with a country with a country with 10,000 hours to <unk> <unk> .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
first of the united states , for kids , <unk> hours of children who are <unk> in school , from the five .
so we have a complete <unk> lab on the young people just to learn what it means , how everything else they learn to learn from school .
and maybe some of you , the new book of malcolm <unk> , `` <unk> . ''
so you know his theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours .
she 's based on the great research of <unk> , that if we have 10,000 hours to have a little bit of a <unk> , in the age of a subject to the 21st century , we 'll be <unk> .
we 're going to be so good at what the most important people of the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what are the two , are the player 's <unk> ? ''
because if we could find out that , we would never have to have a human potential for human potential .
so many people we have in the world , which is at least a day a day in a day , a day .
these are our <unk> , 500 million people who are extraordinary in `` something . ''
and the next decade we have another billion players , which are extraordinary in what are .
you do n't have a person who have n't heard .
the <unk> developed <unk> , which is save the energy and work on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so , so , the <unk> are <unk> , especially in india , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china ,
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have a whole billion player .
so i started to think what it 's , what 's our games to be in the way .
here 's four things i found . when you 've got , you know , <unk> .
okay , imagine how a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately , a challenge , together , with the faith , with a belief that we have a <unk> hope on success .
and so , the player always believe that a <unk> is possible to be done , and that 's always worth it , and that 's the same .
players do n't sit around .
players are masters in the spiders of the spiders of the spiders .
there 's a lot of more interesting , which show us that we like people who are more mature , even if you have been suffering out of the <unk> .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust , to play a game .
we trust that , someone spends time to be more time to give us the rules that we have to have the same goal and to the <unk> .
so the video is to play the game that 's grown , and we can grow through bonds , trust and each other .
and as we 're going to build a consequence of that , we 're getting stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why there 's a <unk> of <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a week , a week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we 're actually happier , work to work hard , when we do n't do , if we do n't do , or nothing .
we know that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a human being done , if we do hard , great work .
and players are still willing to work hard , if you get the right job .
and eventually , the arts , is what it is .
so players love to be part of the awe of connections to some of the intractable of the twist .
so here 's a <unk> , to back to the right light , and you know all the wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> of the world , with nearly 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
you 've got more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than about any other subject of the world in each other <unk> of the world .
they 're creating a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge of the world of warcraft .
so , these are four superpowers who are running at a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
there are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is , you think you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i 'm trying to do .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people have so much time and money and money in <unk> .
and he says , `` we 're going to be able to be less than one <unk> than one <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and that 's a economist . so he 's logical .
and he says ...
not like i -- i think i think i think i 'm a little bit more useful .
so he says that 's actually making sense , because player can get more than in <unk> , and they can get in a real life .
they can be stronger of more powerful with social relationships as a real life , and they get more feedback and reward in games as a real life .
so , he says it 's right now , that player 's <unk> in virtual world than in real time .
i just get it to the voice , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event , which is six years ago .
there 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> . you know ?
this fantastic fantastic <unk> , there was <unk> .
and these were kind of the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you 're familiar with the <unk> of the old greek <unk> , you might know , you might know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom of a famine .
laennec , there was such a great famine that the king of <unk> was to be able to be a crazy idea .
people were done . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so she invented loud <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and they would take a national strategy . you would take food . you would play .
and they would be so much more interesting to the <unk> , there 's so fascinating and <unk> , <unk> productivity , <unk> productivity is that they would forget that nothing was to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and on the next day , you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they survived this famine , by the famine , by the end of a day and they were playing the next little bit of a day .
likewise , i think , we 're going to give you games .
we 're going to put games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we 're playing games to avoid all of the things that do n't work in real world , especially in the real life , and we get out what we need from the games .
but that does n't have not the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
according to <unk> , became a famine , so the famine were not better . so , the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a <unk> , and they had to be <unk> to a <unk> adventure .
they were <unk> <unk> and made a new home . she was just going to go back in a new people , so many people back to the time they had to survive , and they were able to find a place where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> <unk> , which is later the <unk> , the same dna that the old <unk> have to have .
so , scientists recently had a point of what the <unk> story is actually , actually , it 's crazy story .
and geologists found the evidence of a global cooling , which took almost 20 years , which could explain the famine .
so these crazy story could be true .
you might actually saved her people by play , by making 18 years of games , and then they started to play this <unk> , and so they had to get that all of the entire civilization .
so , we can also do it .
we 're going to play with a <unk> of terrorism .
this was the first <unk> in real world of <unk> , which was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> <unk> , we 've been playing with <unk> years .
i 'm telling us , we 're ready for our own personal play .
so , they sent half of their civilization on the search for a new world , so i suppose my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be <unk> that half of us have a lesson every day every day , until we 've done the problems of real world .
i know you 'll ask , `` how do we solve problems in games ? '' and right ?
we have this banner in the office in palo alto , it 's going to understand how to understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best result , and then people have to make these perception of the mind in the reality .
we 're going to provide <unk> <unk> and give people the opportunities to reach them .
i 'm going to show you three games that i 've designed to try to provide people in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where you have to get over a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it 's realistic , and they 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to fly , and then they 're going to be able to fly how to be in the way that they 're going to be in place , whether it 's going to be in the world , whether it 's going to be in the world , whether it 's going to be in the world , whether it 's been going to be in the real life , and we need to find it , and we ask them to get it true , and we ask them to get it , and we ask them to get it , and we ask them to get it , and we ask them to get them , and we ask them to get it , and we ask them to fill it ,
we 've been playing this game with <unk> players , and we 've been <unk> in 2007 . and we 've had one of the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change because it 's good for the environment or because we should be .
but when you 're in a <unk> adventure , and they said , `` we 're the oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure to go .
find out how they 're survival . the most of our players have a little bit of habits in the game of habits .
so the next <unk> game , a bigger , higher goal , it 's a higher risk of goal .
we have a play called <unk> .
what is a little bit of , a <unk> of the <unk> , that people have only have 23 years on the planet .
this dramatic supercomputer called global <unk> , of course .
the call on players , you have a <unk> , we 've moved to a `` <unk> '' <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where there 's the <unk> , and they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and just together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it 's our job to create the future , food , '' security and the future of social justice .
8,000 player were playing eight weeks .
they found 500 creative solutions that they can read if they 're called `` <unk> '' .
and the last game we 're going to call the three . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you leave the game , you get from the world bank , the <unk> of social abuse , at 2010 .
we work with universities in the sub-saharan africa , and they 're going to learn to build a , social entrepreneurs .
we have a comic book . we have the level of understanding , <unk> , sustainability , sustainability , vision , vision , vision , vision , vision .
i would like to invite you all of these game with boys people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , which benefit from their own social enterprises to save the world .
i 'll come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happened next ?
we have all of these fantastic player , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't going to be not saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree with that , that player 's human resources are , that we can use to work in real life , and that games are a great meaning for change .
we have these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to provide narrow social nets , and the desire to <unk> meaning .
i really hope we 're playing together in the world , to survive a different century to the planet .
and i hope you 'll be able to design me with these things and play .
when i put in the next decade , i 'm sure to be a lot of things that we can create every <unk> future , and that we can all play possible games .
so i say , let 's start playing games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something that 's a written meeting a story for a <unk> of <unk> .
i 've always write my <unk> <unk> , but i was with the <unk> of the <unk> , and i realized that i was never going to be in my life , which is the word `` disabled ''
i read the post .
`` <unk> '' : `` <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , sensitive to be sensitive .
i 've got these list of a friend of a friend who read and i had to look like this , it was so ridiculous , but i was n't going to be <unk> , and i had to stop and i had to stop reading that <unk> <unk> , and
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that a copy has to be a very old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i started building school and so , in the process of my family sphere , also in terms of other children , and also in terms of the world around me .
and so god is not using a <unk> experiment .
would i have a post , i would have a lot of a world that someone would be able to perceive as a person like me as a person who can perceive as a person who can be able to be able to run their lives in <unk> , but i 'll be able to be a chance of opportunities for the odds and adventure i 've experienced ,
so i immediately struck the <unk> of 2009 , and i expect that i find a <unk> <unk> .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it 's not better .
in particular , i 'm in the last two words , in near near <unk> , '' `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about people that we think about these words .
it 's about the values that put in these words , and how we do these values .
our language impacts our language and how we see the world and people around us .
many of the <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> force is , because what you can be <unk> ,
so what do we want to do , what we 're doing is , a <unk> person , or a powerful person ?
only one person is called a child as a child , you might have to be able to <unk> and <unk> them , and they 're <unk> .
would n't it be nice to open the doors ?
a person who opened me to me , my pediatrician was in the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , who can do , who can not think most americans could n't mean , so he became dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> was always very colorful , and he was just as kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to repeat the exercise of these <unk> , and i 've got to create a lot of things -- in several colors -- and i 've got to <unk> them , and i hated them . i hated her . i hated it .
and imagine i 've even had a <unk> kid with dr. <unk> , and so i tried to stop these exercises , <unk> without success .
and one day he 's looking at my exercises -- these exercises were just italian and <unk> -- and he said to me , `` wow , you 're like a strong girl , <unk> and calf girl , you 're going to get one day of this <unk> .
and if you do it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
and that was one of a simple quote from dr. <unk> , so i did n't want to make the exercises i would not want to get in the middle of the ward , but he was actually <unk> my daily <unk> with new eyes . so it became a new and new experience .
and i 'm going to wonder , how much his vision of me as a strong and <unk> young girl shaped my own self , and i could imagine as a strong , of a strong , powerful and <unk> human being .
this is just one example of many , like adults , in <unk> , the child 's imagination .
but how to talk about the <unk> idea of the <unk> prove , to be our language , we have no room , to imagine something that we would all want to see , to see each other people to see a powerful person .
our language <unk> of the societal changes of the world , which is in many cases of technology .
and from the medical standpoint , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of
so maybe that kind of technological change , because it 's always one other truth , which is that everyone 's human being a very <unk> and very <unk> , and that the human ability to adapt , is to adapt to us , to adapt , our biggest plus .
human ability to find out -- this is a interesting story , because people are always to tell me about it , and i 'm not going to give you a little bit of proof , and i 'm not really comfortable with me , and i felt very uncomfortable with people who are really excited about people who are going to answer questions from people , and i think i think , and i think i think i think ,
this sentence from odds are struggling to be a point that success or happiness depends on the idea of a challenge , without being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
but the truth is that we change us . of course , we are the challenge of the challenge , whether you do n't physically , whether it 's physically , emotionally or even both .
and i 'm telling you that this is good .
against odds , not an obstacle that we need to be able to get to get better in our lives .
against odds are just to be our lives .
and i tend to know , inventing odds , to see my shadows .
sometimes i realize that he 's very presence , sometimes it 's not to see , but it 's all the time .
and i 'm not going to do n't really not really do it the impact or whatever the <unk> of a human being brought up .
there 's been frustration and challenges and challenges , and they 're only real and in the way , and every person 's going to be different from it . but the question is not , but the question is not , whether we 're going to be sustainable , but not , but not , it 's not , but
so we 're not only responsible for that , people who love to preserve <unk> , but they 're also willing to get very clear to it .
and we do n't really like our children , if we give them the feeling that you ca n't fit .
you have to be clear to two things : to one of the medical fact , a lot of the way , a lot of the way , the social belief , and to other people , whether i 'm an <unk> or not .
and to be honest , the only real and disability , with me , with me to get me , is that the world is all the world , and i could describe me to these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are in the heart , and they 're the <unk> , to provide hard truth to their medical response to the quality of the quality of life , or even a prediction to the quality of life , we have to be a prediction of the quality of life that we have to have to be the foundation that we actually have a <unk> .
maybe this is the current concept that 's just going to be a broken , and how we repair the repair , for each one of a greater disability than the conversation in the arts .
if we do n't treat a human being , and not all of their forces and expertise , we have to be able to have a level of the natural struggle , which maybe you have to have another disease .
we 're a person who has a value of our society .
so we need to look at the <unk> , and we focus on all the realm of human possibilities .
but most important is that there 's the perception of our facial <unk> and our great <unk> , there 's a connection .
we should n't have <unk> times or even in the threat , we should n't try to avoid them , nor should be on the carpet , but it 's going to be opposed to the odds of odds .
and i might be more about to give you a bit of thinking that we have n't necessarily deeply concerned about frustration , but that we 're open to the motor , to put them to use a <unk> and dance .
and maybe we can make it godless as something natural , selfish and useful , and useful , and useful , and they can not feel that as <unk> us from the presence of the presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 of the birthday of charles darwin and when he had a <unk> years ago over evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in something very true of human character .
i would make it so this : not the most powerful , it 's not the most powerful way of being , and not the most vulnerable way of the way that changes the change in the best .
and from conflict , creativity is coming .
not only from darwin , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , from the fight from human spirit , to turn themselves .
so , change and adjusting , the great answer is the great capabilities of people .
and maybe we 're just aware of what wood we 're <unk> , if we 're really excited .
perhaps that 's the sense of odds , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can imagine something like itself .
we can not innovate a new importance that 's beyond hard times .
maybe we can transform against change as change .
adversities for a change that we have not adapted to have been <unk> .
i think the biggest damage we have to have the two things that we have to believe that we should be normal .
who 's a heart attack , who is normal ?
there is no normal thing .
so , there 's the usual . but not the normal . and you would n't want to find these arms , gray person really know when it could really have really ?
i do n't think it 's not a little bit .
it would be great if we 're going to be a new paradigm of normal versus the strength or the strength , to make it even a little dangerous , and we can give them the forces of a lot of kids , and we invite them to be a very special and precious capabilities in society .
and so , <unk> found that we have people from the members of our society , and have a <unk> , useful to be useful and a contribution .
there 's evidence that 's the <unk> of the <unk> people in the <unk> <unk> , and people with <unk> physical injury , and perhaps that would happen to be the capacity of the people that would be precious .
they do n't have these people as broken and useless , they were treated as a special and precious function .
a few years ago , i went in the city , in a <unk> , in a <unk> in the red zone , in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear how a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not a <unk> . ''
and i call myself around and see the older man . i did n't know who he 's .
and i 'd like , `` excuse me , sir , i do n't know it . ''
and he said , `` well , you 're not going to remember me .
when i saw her , i was <unk> out of her mother . ''
oh , so .
and then , then , it did n't work .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i had just had from stories of my mother 's day , because i had a typical day , typical day to late ,
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew my man who brought me to the world , not .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had to give you a sound of this and a few toes at the other foot , he had the <unk> , this stranger had to be wrong .
he said , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` you would say you would never run so much as <unk> or whether you never had a living life , or that you could never be a <unk> life , and that 's just a little bit of being a <unk> . ''
i was really extraordinary , i was able to have collected my whole childhood , whether i had a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had my fellowship at the <unk> , whether i had my fellowship of <unk> , whether i had my fellowship of my <unk> , and he had this <unk> , and he used this <unk> , and he used this <unk> , and he used this <unk> , and he used to teach his students to teach his students , <unk> in the <unk> medical school school .
and he called this part of his <unk> factor , the potential of human being .
you ca n't even stress enough to the most important factor of the quality of the quality of people .
and dr. <unk> told you , `` i 've learned that kids , if you 've got to say anything else , and if you only get a little support , if you get kids , if you 're going to get kids , then kids can be much more . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has been changed .
he had understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone are doing with their own , two different things .
and i 've got to have been able to have a lot of thinking of time , if you had asked me in the age of 15 years , whether i had my prostheses from flesh and bone , i would n't have a second .
i wanted to be normal things like this .
if you ask me tonight , i 'm not so safe .
and this is what happened , because i 've got something with my legs , and not even in the experiences .
and maybe that change could also happen because i 've been looking at so many people who have opened out the doors , rather than to face people who are , to me , or me , to me , to me , or me to me , and i wanted to be able to find a idea on me .
you see , it 's really just a person who can show you , who 's showing you how they can make their forces , and they 're through .
if you can make it to activate your own , to be its own forces -- human mind is so versatile -- if you can open it , and for someone in a critical moment , you 're opening up to these people , then you are a very good teacher .
they 're going to open them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word `` <unk> '' in the word `` <unk> '' .
it means something that is that in a one , that 's the potential to make .
again , what potential is we want to look at this ?
in the '60s , in britain , a <unk> , <unk> were transformed in <unk> .
they call this `` <unk> <unk> '' in the united states , we call it as `` <unk> . ''
students are <unk> down .
and the a students are being <unk> , and they get better teachers , etc .
and they have a <unk> period of students with a <unk> , a very good thing , they were told you , they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and after these three months , they really had written
and of course , it 's a heart attack , of the heart of the outside of the <unk> was told , they 're just enough .
and then it was also a very end up in the three months .
but only the ones who still were still in school -- except by the students who had had school school .
and there was the key to this study that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
you just said that the student was being a student , and that 's the students who are the student with the note , and they 're also taught you something that 's taught them and they treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind that was broken , broken , has no hope , and he 's not a little bit . he 's missing our natural , <unk> curiosity . and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we create it , to support the human spirit of being alive , and to hope , and other people to find themselves around and then we 're going to be curious , and then we 're going to get our forces really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities is , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i 'd like to end with a poem , which is a <unk> poet named <unk> , and my friend charles <unk> tells me , and the poem is `` god , '' and the god knows , `` the god , '' not the god of the <unk> , but the time i mean , is just going to say , `` come up ,
come , dance . thank you .
