when steve lopez , david <unk> of los angeles , one day in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , homeless , homeless , who played on a violin who had two vibrating .
many of you will know the story , because it 's been a book , later , later , <unk> <unk> , with robert <unk> , <unk> <unk> and jamie <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> at the <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a <unk> on the streets of <unk> row in los angeles .
i recommend all of all , <unk> book , or to see the film that they do n't just understand the beautiful language , but also , as the music is the instrument that is the instrument that is the instrument that is the instrument that is the instrument that is the instrument , when this pun is to get the <unk> , <unk> path to get the
i met mr. mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in terms of disney <unk> .
he had just heard a demo of <unk> and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he talked to a very <unk> and <unk> sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never do in the baseball world , and it 's all the first <unk> of the first <unk> in the last year of <unk> <unk> .
we have to talk about music . and a few days later , i got a email in the state that <unk> was interested in my career .
i still need to mention saying that <unk> <unk> is a medical treatment , because it was already treated with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been <unk> his entire life .
now , as a result , he 's particularly curious about these <unk> stages , and these are sometimes <unk> , and he 's in the streets of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in a <unk> , <unk> , when we started with our first talk to walt disney hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison him in the sleep .
i did n't fear , but i was afraid i could lose that he could be <unk> in a situation , and that i was going to destroy his relationship with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and other forms of the <unk> ,
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and while i played , i fell in <unk> , in <unk> eyes , a <unk> change .
it was when he stood under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose hit my game .
<unk> <unk> ruins itself in understanding in a calm curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracle , he took his refrigerator and started to play some clips of <unk> , and then asked me to play it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then we started talking about music , started from the stream about beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he did n't just know a <unk> about music , but also him with their high personal relationship .
he talked about a passion and a understanding that i only know about my colleagues at the <unk> of los angeles .
by reading music and talk about music , from this <unk> , confused a man who moved by the streets of los angeles , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for <unk> , music is <unk> health .
because the music allows it to make his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real true .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that exactly the creatures of art is .
and this is the reason that we make music : so we do something that we 're in our minds , our emotions , through our artistic lens through reality .
and the reality of the expression has all of us all , and it 's all , inspired and us .
what <unk> did , so it brought him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back into a family of musicians that was the mind that was his talent and the '70s .
and i 'm always going to play with <unk> music , no matter whether , disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> <unk> , because he reminds me , why i grew musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i 've been stolen the <unk> .
i hope to me tell me .
so i was known in my life .
i 've had two loved ones .
this first , that was more like a passionate kind of <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
well , better , he was going to be in <unk> , after the supposedly <unk> of sustainability .
so you could feel like to sell him .
i had this beauty with this beauty of several months .
and one day , the head of the company , and asked if i could be in a event of the sustainability .
of course , i said .
here was a company , which was trying to solve what a huge problem has become a lawyer , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans as we have <unk> <unk> .
it 's hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so , maybe or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it , <unk> the environment , most of you , most of you , most of you , most of them , and they 're inefficient , we take tuna .
he has a <unk> of 15 .
that means , 15 pounds of <unk> are required to get a pound .
not sustainable .
it 's not very good .
so finally , finally a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
in the day of the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let 's tell him .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` only about the facts , you 're famous for it , so far outside the ocean is not a <unk> . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out there , that the waste of our fish will be <unk> . ''
and then he started to add , `` we 're basically a personal world .
and this <unk> of <unk> , '' he said .
`` the best of the business . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> , what do you get your ? ''
`` sustainable protein , he said .
`` great , '' i said . put it .
and at this night , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just a long time ago , unfortunately .
i said , `` well , what are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he did n't know that he did n't . he 's going to be doing questions .
well , i 'm <unk> with a few people in the company . no one could give me a <unk> answer , until i finally <unk> with the <unk> biologists .
let 's tell him it .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` well , for example , are sustainable protein ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yeah , <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much percent of the brain is chicken ? ''
again , maybe two percent .
well , it 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what is sustainable to feed grilled chicken ?
there was a long pause in the leadership and he said , `` there are just a lot of chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
it 's me .
no , i actually have <unk> in this fish , because i 'm <unk> in god , who has <unk> that conversation after chicken .
this second fish , that 's another type of <unk> .
it 's romantic species that you know , the better you learn to know your fish , you know the fish you know .
i first ate it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> reporter have been talking about this fish .
it has been a <unk> way .
he came up with a red white white paint .
the chef had him him .
twice .
astonishingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so good , after he was <unk> ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
let 's call him miguel . actually he is miguel .
and no , he did n't get the fish and he 's not a chef . at least , at the way , and i understand .
it 's a biologist in <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it 's near the <unk> of the river .
in the 1980s , the farm was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're <unk> on what was basically wetlands .
they did it through the country .
they built these complicated , and they were <unk> water out of the country , and from the river .
well , they did n't do that that was working , not economically economically .
and ecological was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds who are many birds .
and so a spanish company bought the country .
what did you do ?
they have the river of the water .
they 're literally <unk> the walls .
instead of the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and his company , the <unk> destruction completely different .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything .
you keep looking at the horizon , the one million miles away , and everything you see is <unk> channels and these density , voluptuous .
i was not a long time in front of it , miguel time ago .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of the <unk> .
okay ? there we were and fought us through the wetlands , and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knee , and miguel commentary is a <unk> .
and here he turns out there , he turns out there .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , this is a pattern of <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> .
it turns out that miguel the biggest part of his career spent in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i know nothing about fish .
i 'm a expert in relationships . ''
and then he goes , and falls in more <unk> of these rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and do n't understand me , it was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , it was like a way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was <unk> about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish i had .
so i did it . i said , `` miguel , how does it tastes like your fish tastes so good ? ''
he showed up the algae .
i know , young , the algae , phytoplankton , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
well , he goes on to tell me that there is a <unk> system that the fish would eat , which they would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish get ruins .
the system is so healthy it is completely <unk> .
there is no food .
the one of a farm is that the animals do n't bite your animals ?
and later , i went to a day on this site , and i asked him , i said , `` well , for a place , `` well , for a place , '' of course , which seems to be so much like any farm i have been , `` how are you success ? ''
in the moment , it was a <unk> <unk> .
and we were bow to the corner , and we had the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of thousands of <unk> , literally <unk> the eye .
`` this is success , '' he said .
`` look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> do n't your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> in the birds .
well last year , last year , 18 birds were 18 than 250 different ways .
it 's the biggest and one of the most important private private <unk> in all europe .
i said , `` miguel , is not a good <unk> that you want to have a <unk> . ''
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> .
this is a <unk> network .
they eat the shrimp .
the shrimp are eating phytoplankton .
so the <unk> the belly is the belly of the car .
okay , let 's rethink this . a farm that does n't divide their animals , and a farm that is your success of your mobile phone .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> should not be there .
they breed in a town of <unk> miles away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
there are <unk> miles to farm .
and every night , they fly miles back .
they do this , because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> line .
seriously .
i had this kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel <unk> .
i said , `` miguel , fly the kilometers of the farm and fly it back to the night ?
do you do the kids ? ''
and he looked at me when i had a song of <unk> houston .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i did n't mentioned the skin of my loved <unk> , and i do n't like a <unk> . i do n't like it . i do n't like you .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm never going to leave you .
and yet , when i did it in this restaurant , they did n't care about <unk> <unk> .
they did sweet and actually , as if you would take a bites from the ocean .
i mentioned , miguel and <unk> .
he said , `` the skin works like a sponge .
it 's the final authority before something in the body .
she has evolved in terms of evolution to <unk> <unk> . ''
and then he said , `` well , our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , which is not <unk> your fish , which is a farm , which is the success of their <unk> .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm , he did n't have a <unk> , he 's huge , because the water that flows through this farm coming in the river .
it 's a river that makes all the things that are rivers of these things , and they tend to lead them with , chemical pollutants , <unk> .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves is cleaner , as it 's <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that does n't divide their animals , not just a farm , but a farm , but a farm , but not only only for these fish , but not just
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , but i 'll take it , and i should do it , because these <unk> , as romantic , is the <unk> .
you could say it 's a recipe for the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food .
but for many people , it 's a little bit too different .
we 're not <unk> , we 're <unk> . we 're <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat organic food .
and when you say that this is the things that you 're talking about the future of the future , someone else says , `` hey people , i love <unk> , but how do you feed the world ?
how do you feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not , because we 're going to produce enough calories to produce more than the world .
a billion people will be fighting today .
a billion -- this is more than before -- because of the <unk> neuron in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i do n't like this question , because they have the logic of our <unk> that has been about the last 50 years .
<unk> grain on <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken , chicken , and the whole time do n't ask them , `` if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can be cheaper ? ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> , it was the business community of the american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> capital that allow the production .
this is not a <unk> , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> today is threat today , not because of <unk> , but by <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by fertile country , not by pumps , not by <unk> water , not by <unk> , and not by <unk> and nets , but by <unk> , but by <unk> , but by the <unk> , but by the <unk> .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable any community to feed itself ?
to do that , do n't look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it never has something really good to eat .
instead , instead , the ecological model .
this is the first billion years old .
see miguel , farmers like miguel ,
the organizations that are not the worlds for people who grow , instead of <unk> , enterprises , instead of growing , growing , farmers , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they 're the ones who are experts for flavor .
and when i 'm actually , you 're a better chef than i 'll ever be .
you know , this is right , because if the future is good , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to tell you a thing about the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about how we can think of how we use information , and we see it is so much so much as well , and we see that trends will be
so what we see here is a typical <unk> for old <unk> .
the program i 'm using here is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> , is that i can filter a certain reason to filter , let 's tell you .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it .
and in fact , because in the <unk> , the people here are on the <unk> , and they are over the <unk> .
we can go to a step further and go and see the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the normal suspects , but not for everyone .
if we go on , and after age , we see 40 years or younger , that accidents should be concerned about people .
and who 's going to see that this is true in men .
so you can see that this is the graph of information and data in this way of swimming in a living environment .
and if we can do this for raw raw materials not for content ?
so what we have here are the <unk> of every single individual <unk> that have ever been printed in .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
you can like to test it in my particular talk .
with <unk> , you can turn it into a decade .
you can turn it into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a particular copy .
so if i look at this , i see the athletes , the athletes , and the <unk> .
i 'm an lance <unk> fan , so i 'm going to check out to me all spending in which surgery is mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> <unk> , i could think , `` well , what if i 'm going to look at it with the issue ? ''
so i go back to a step back , and i 'm going to look at the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a idea of this , that if you show up on this kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you do n't just do or <unk> .
you do something that 's actually a bit different .
it 's something in between , and we think it can change the way it can be used .
and i want to do this idea to make a little bit more uncomfortable .
what we 've done here , we took each individual <unk> , and they were <unk> on a little <unk> .
the summary contains a quick <unk> and a symbol of it .
i 'll just show the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a hint of the topics that are on wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose the issue for the issue .
now , after i have chosen , i know that the <unk> , who are <unk> at most of time , for the time , for time , time , `` people who are <unk> .
this is really important , because this is a realization that 's not in a single <unk> .
this is just when you go to a step back , and the whole thing .
<unk> on a particular of these <unk> , i can go back in the theme of time , `` people in the year , '' and see all together .
now , if i look at all of these individuals , some of them are <unk> , some of the science , some of it , some of the economy , there 's my boss , and one is coming from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize winner .
so we can go back to it , and see a look at all ted .
you look at the web in the web as if it 's a net , not just the side , but it 's more useful .
and so i 'd like to show you what else could be a little bit .
and i just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i 'm not going to call it a browser ; it 's not a browser , but you can see websites -- and we put these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and you jump to a specific <unk> .
and so that 's important , because you just look at the look at the web of websites in this way , and look at all the <unk> .
so i can zoom in my way in a particular way .
here 's the state of the entire demonstration that i 've been looking at this .
and i can kind of like everything i 've been looking at today , again .
and when i go back again , and i look at everything , i can be new to my <unk> , maybe i was looking for <unk> ' <unk> , and here to be <unk> , or here , live in democracy .
and from here , i can go in the side , and i 'll call it again .
it 's a metaphor that goes over again , and every time it makes the big larger than the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a <unk> .
we 're talking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 're talking about `` <unk> in information . ''
what if we could turn this situation , and the internet on the head , so instead of going to go from a lot of things to go to many things , and it can see that otherwise otherwise hidden hidden .
if we can do this , then , then this was going to be a new <unk> , maybe a new source of different information .
and , instead of going to move in information , we can know it .
and if we know about it , maybe we can even get the wisdom of it .
so i hear , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school , every day every day .
and my nose went always in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts in other worlds , and my deep way to <unk> myself , <unk> curiosity .
this curiosity also came to me , when i was not in school , by the forests , <unk> , <unk> , frogs , frogs and snakes and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limits of the study .
and my love to science fiction seemed to <unk> in my environment , because back in the late '60s , we went to the moon and <unk> the deep sea .
jacques <unk> came in our living room with his intriguing shows that animals and places and places and places and places , and a world of the world that showed us before .
that 's probably going to be good at the <unk> .
and i was artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games still <unk> the whole image of computer-generated images in the media landscape , i had to create images in my head .
so we had all the time . if we first read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> it on the screen .
my response to draw the <unk> and paint from aliens , aliens , robots , <unk> and all .
in mathematics , i was caught out of teachers , like i hidden in the <unk> textbook , <unk> .
the creativity had to go out of it .
and some interesting thing happened to me , which was me puzzled by jacques <unk> , was the idea of the unknown world in our earth .
well , i would never get a quiet world .
but here was a world that i was actually going to come in here , and she was as amazing and exotic and exotic as well , when i read these books .
so , i decided to be 15 .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
i did n't try to make it <unk> .
i 'm going to <unk> my father , until he finally ended up a <unk> in <unk> , new york , looking at the other side of the border , where we lived .
i did my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in the middle of the middle of <unk> , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years , i spent about three hours of <unk> , 500 hours of them .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep sea , in the <unk> oceans , and so the realm of the oceans , is the realm of <unk> lives , how we can barely imagine .
the heart of nature knows no limits in fact , in addition to our own , <unk> human imagination .
for days , days , i feel the deepest awe for what i see on my <unk> .
and my love for the ocean keeps out of the same intensity as well , and the ever .
when i was a <unk> , it was the <unk> .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner <unk> , stories , with my need , images to create images .
as a child , i did all <unk> and so .
so the movies were , images and stories , and that adapted .
of course , the stories i 've got to <unk> from the <unk> , `` <unk> , '' `` <unk> , '' and `` <unk> . ''
and i could <unk> my <unk> for the <unk> and connect with the <unk> .
so are <unk> my two passions .
some interesting thing happened in `` <unk> '' : to solve a <unk> problem in this movie -- and that was to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- that was the <unk> of suspended animation ,
and what came out was the first <unk> <unk> that was ever in a film .
the film brought no money , he was just played a little bit of a <unk> , but i realized something amazing : the audience in the world was like <unk> from the magic of it .
according to arthur according to the law , we 're unaware of <unk> technology and magic .
so they saw something magic .
and i found it incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that must be involved in the <unk> . ''
so we went into `` <unk> two , '' my next film , still .
together with <unk> <unk> , we created the guys out of liquid metal , and that success was pretty much about how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we did something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have a little more money .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend <unk> , the best friend of the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called digital <unk> .
the idea of this company was that the stage <unk> processes with visual <unk> , and just start with the digital <unk> .
and then we did , and then we did a advantage of an advantage of a advantage .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we did is actually formed the company -- too slowly .
i had written this piece of <unk> , which is the <unk> of visual , and <unk> effects of the new effects , and <unk> effects of the new heights , with realistic human rights , and the <unk> of the <unk> is created by <unk> , and the <unk> should be <unk> .
but the <unk> <unk> , and the people in my company told me that we do n't be able to do that .
so i started that , and i did this other film about the big ship , the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> , i sold it as a <unk> and julia . it was a <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
but i did n't want to go to the real <unk> of the titanic .
and that 's why i did the film .
that 's the truth . the studio did n't know that .
but i 've convinced them by saying , `` we go to the train . we film the real school .
we 're going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
that 's hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing .
and i <unk> them to finance a big expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to it that your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later in a russian time , in a russian time , in a russian <unk> , four miles under the surface of the sea floor , and i was the real titanic to the <unk> .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so that was really neutral .
and it was a lot of this . we had to build cameras and <unk> and everything .
and i fell in how much these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you 're going to go in this capsule , then you 're going to go into this dark environment , <unk> environment , where no hope is going on , if you do n't get it back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's the same as i would be in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was actually obsessed with the deep sea level .
anyway , the part of curiosity and science was . it was it . it was curiosity . it was a curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature , and i could set up a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
in some of the next of these things , i 've seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes that no one had never seen before , and for the science of time , when we saw it , when we saw it , i did n't see words yet .
so that has my <unk> , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met something some special decision .
and after all of the titanic , i said , `` okay , i want to go to my <unk> in hollywood to <unk> it . ''
and then we started , we went to `` <unk> , '' and study them with <unk> .
we turned back to the walls of the titanic .
we took a little robot that we built up with a <unk> <unk> .
our intent was , <unk> , and the inside of the ship was never been done before .
nobody ever had the head of the <unk> . you had no choice for it . so we developed the technology .
well , i 'm sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see a <unk> , which i 'm pretty much like this <unk> , and i know that once the band played there .
and i 'm floating with a little <unk> of the ship .
i actually <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the <unk> .
it felt myself , when i was living in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> , which i have ever experienced . because before i was going to take a corner , i 'd always been looking at what i was going to walked in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , i was leaving months of the <unk> .
and this kind of was a hidden replica of the <unk> of the ship .
so this was a highly strange experience .
and she made this kind of <unk> that you use such <unk> and the own consciousness in the vehicle , in that other form of existence .
it was really deeply profound .
and maybe a little bit of view on what could happen in some decades , if you have <unk> , to study something or other things that i can imagine as a <unk> .
after these expeditions , we started to figure out what we had to learn to , for example , these <unk> , where we saw this incredible surprising animals . that 's the aliens , but this is on earth .
they live with help .
they do n't exist in a sunlight as we do it .
and so you see animals that are going to go back to a 500 degrees c that they can survive there .
at the same time , i also been very interested in the same time , that was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and nasa is going to sit in the <unk> , and the right now is to go back in the <unk> , and they 're going to go back to the mission of censorship , and then go to the international <unk>
this was fascinating .
but at the end , it turns out that i was <unk> with us in the deep sea .
i took them with you and <unk> access to the world , <unk> , people who were interested in such an extreme situations , and i took them to the <unk> , so they took samples and take instruments and so on .
and we turned out of it , now we did n't have science , actually , <unk> .
and so , the circle between my existence as a <unk> , as a child , as a child , and the connection in reality .
in the course of this <unk> , i 've learned a lot of .
i 've learned a lot about science , but i 'm sure you now think , a director must be able to have a leader , a leader , or so .
i do n't understand a lot of leadership before i do it .
because at a particular point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what come from ? ''
these <unk> movies do n't make money .
we 're just playing the <unk> . it 's not a <unk> .
all i think i 'm between `` titanic '' and `` avatar '' and i had the <unk> on a towel on the beach .
i all have these films , these <unk> , for a very small audience .
no fame , no <unk> , no money . what do you do ?
you 're doing it to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , you 're doing it , and because of the strange connection , and because of the strange connection , that 's a little group of people a team .
because we did all about 10 to 12 to 12 to 12 to 12 to 12 to 12 to 12 to 12 people working , and sometimes we were two to three months in the road .
and in this community , you see the most important thing that you have thought of each other , because you have a task that you can not explain .
if you go to country , and it says , `` we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the difficulty that is working on the <unk> , if you do n't explain that in the <unk> , and that 's like the other thing , '' you can not explain that in the police , and in the other hand , that 's like the police or the police , and in the united states , you can tell the other people in the <unk> , and in the other hand , that 's like the police or the police , and in the united states , the police or the police , and in the united states , that 's like the police or in the police , and in the united states , the police or the police , and in the united states , the police or the police , and in the united states , the police or the police , and in the united states , the police or the police , and in the united states , the police or the police , and in the united
there 's a connection , a range of respect .
so when i went back to turn my first film `` avatar '' , i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you promise to be a team and feel the <unk> .
it was really changed .
so , i was again with a little team in <unk> terrain . we turned `` avatar , '' with a new technique that had not yet before .
it 's incredibly exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were becoming a long time for a long time .
and it changed my way to make movies completely .
there were people who said , we would have had this <unk> <unk> , really <unk> on the planet .
it was more a <unk> way to do my job , which has really changed the process that has changed .
so what can we get out of all of this ?
what are we learned ?
i think , first , the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the death of your team is more important than all of these <unk> .
to come up , young <unk> , who say , `` give me a advice , how i can do something like this . ''
and i say , `` <unk> do n't .
and this is the other thing to do you . do n't do it yourself , you do n't stop yourself against yourself . take risks .
nasa has this <unk> : `` failure is not a alternative . ''
but in the art and in laboratories , failure has to be an alternative , because there is a <unk> .
no important proposition , the innovation was going to be addressed without risk .
you need to be willing to take risks .
that 's the idea i 'd like to give you to the path . it 's not a alternative , fear , but is no . thank you .
today i 'm talking to you about energy and climate .
and this might seem to be surprised because my <unk> of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed , to have the things that we invent and offer to the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate change is extremely important for these people , only more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> is not growing up to many years , it 's too much better than it , things will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to thrive as it can not exist .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
so , it will be a climate effect for you .
also , the <unk> is very important for them .
the fact is that if you could just reduce the price of the price , the energy of the most important most effective .
well , the <unk> is like time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and therefore we can do modern materials and do so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let 's increase the price , we meet a new barrier , and these <unk> are filled with co2 .
co2 warms the planet and the equation for co2 is quite clear .
it <unk> the co2 co2 , which leads to the <unk> , and these <unk> players are very negative to the weather , and maybe worse , the surprising ecosystems , that the natural ecosystems can not adapt such as a <unk> change , and therefore <unk>
well , the exact connection between a <unk> and the process of <unk> and where their other consequences are , there are some <unk> , but not a lot .
and there are certain <unk> about how bad these consequences will be . but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the <unk> times , `` do we have to go down to zero ?
do n't you know half or a quarter ? ''
and the answer is : until we go close to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and that 's why it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a 3.5 amount of fat truck under one three meters of <unk> .
this must be down , on zero .
well , we are <unk> every year of <unk> , about 26 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it 's about five tons of the planet .
and somehow , we need to change changes that are down to zero .
it 's been <unk> up .
only different economic changes , it has been influenced by the world , and we need to be <unk> by risk to reduction and to have a reduction in zero .
and this equation has four factors . it 's a little bit of <unk> -- they have this thing -- co2 -- that will be lost to zero , from the service that every person in the average , the average of the average , the average energy for the average , of the average of every service , the average energy for the average , and the co2 that will be a <unk>
so let 's look at any factor of a factor , and think about how we get to zero .
probably probably must be close to zero .
now , this is the basic algebra , but we go to it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it 's going to go on <unk> nine billion to go to 9 billion .
if we 're successful with new <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> are , we could reduce 10 percent , but we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
it 's something that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> , which means that services almost almost every one on the planet .
it 's great that this number is going on .
in the rich world , in the upper world , we might be able to do more <unk> and less use , but in the average of the average , this number is going to go through every year , and it 's going to double <unk> , the number of services ,
here we see a very fundamental service . there 's a little light , so you can read the homework .
and these students do n't , so they go out and read your <unk> under the <unk> .
well , in efficiency , the e , the energy per barrel , there 's a good news .
we have something that does n't go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through other ways of growing up with new ways , there are a lot of services to grow up with it , to reduce the energy to 90 percent .
in other service , like <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , is the very much smaller .
in total , if we 're optimistic , maybe we 'll get a factor for a factor of three or maybe 100,000 .
but at the first three factors , we 're going to go from 26 billion tons of 26 billion tons , and it 's not a good thing .
so let 's see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a <unk> -- that 's the amount of co2 that will be <unk> .
it turns out if you can get it on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn gas , you know , no .
almost every <unk> of electricity for electricity today , except the renewables and renewables .
so what we need to do on a global level is , is a new system .
we need <unk> .
if i do the term , i do n't mean , i 'm not the impossible .
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and their services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
they do n't have a <unk> that you need a miracle to a certain date .
it 's normally , you know , you 're just going to come back and some of them are not coming .
but in this case , we have to give up <unk> and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i said , how can i really do it ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration , which is the idea of people here ?
i reminded me last year when i brought mosquitos , and somehow , people liked it .
the idea was really important for them , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , that 's what i fell .
i decided to be the <unk> of fireflies to be my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here are a bunch of natural fireflies .
you have to tell me that you do n't bite . actually , you 're not going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they do n't get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or a lot of them have a huge amount of scale , and even though there are many directions that people are looking at that , i 'm actually looking at five , which can do this huge demands .
i have worn , <unk> , merger and biofuels .
this might be a <unk> contribution , and if they afford better than i expect , but my boss is , but i 'm not going to give up of all these five work , and we can not give us about that , because they have <unk> , because we have a significant problems .
let 's first look at the burning of fossil fuel , burning of the coal or natural gas .
and what you have to do , maybe it might be simple , but it 's not all the co2 coming from the <unk> , <unk> , under pressure , and then it 's going to go somewhere and hope that it stays there .
there 's a bunch of <unk> , which is on 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it 's very difficult to get to the <unk> of the co2 , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of garbage you can imagine by <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a hard <unk> .
next : <unk> .
it also have three problems -- the cost of <unk> countries are high , but the question for security is that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human chemistry , that fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because although he 's not very big , there 's a lot of attention .
so three very difficult problems that are solvable , and that 's why you should work .
the last three of the five of the five <unk> .
it 's the renewables to be called <unk> .
and yet , although it 's great , they have no fuel -- they have some downsides .
for a one is the <unk> that these technologies produce dramatically than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , 1,000 thousand than a regular power .
and also , these vents are <unk> .
the sun does n't seem to be the whole day , it 's not even every day , and the same as the wind is not always the end .
and so you have to have , if you 're dependent upon these sources , a way that energy is also available in times when they do n't get available .
so there 's big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission of transmission , if we say , it 's not only the energy of the country , you do n't need the technology , you need to deal with the risk of where the energy is
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i 've all kinds of batteries , which , the computer , cell phone , cell phone , and the computer , for all of the electronic energy , and i found the amount of the electronic energy , and i found that all the batteries that we can produce , less than 10 minutes ,
so we need a huge breakthrough , something that 's going to be 100 better than the process of time .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
that happens when you try to do this <unk> <unk> about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest .
if you want to have 100 percent of it , you need a incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
the manhattan project ? how do we come to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies that are working on this work .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many , they say , they 're nuts . it 's good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many , who have been engaged there .
bill 's big companies who have several companies , which has a great <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are investing in dozens of companies to do the great things and have interesting ways , and i try to try to support it .
nathan <unk> , and i fund a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry before , so it 's not great surprise that some good things around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , the one percent , we decided to burn 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty bad idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it for a long time , but you could n't have a good way , if it was going to work , but it 's modern supercomputer , you can see it , and see that : yes ! with the right <unk> .
and because you burn that 99 percent , it 's very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can use it from the waste of today .
instead of breaking out of the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
this is a <unk> <unk> , a bit like a candle .
you see that it 's a kind of pillar , often , as a <unk> wave .
and the purpose of <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste of 99 percent . you have the part of this today , so it 's called <unk> <unk> .
it 's the most u.s. election for hundreds of years .
and when you have <unk> cheap and simple , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's a example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let 's think about how we should measure our success .
how should our argument look like ?
well , let 's go to the goal we have to reach and then we talk about the <unk> .
a lot of talk about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it 's really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be generated in poor countries , and there 's still a <unk> agriculture , and hopefully it will be <unk> and cement .
so to reach these 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , their <unk> .
the other note says if we 're using the <unk> technology , whether it 's in all of countries , and we 're on the path to get it to the rest .
this is great important .
that 's going to be a shift shift .
when we go back there , how should the 2020 look like ?
it should contain the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to go to reduce reduction in the way , the less we <unk> , the lower is the <unk> , and it 's the temperature .
but actually this note for things we have companies that are not completely independent to the big <unk> , the same , or even something less important as the other things that the <unk> of the innovation .
this risk must be tracking with <unk> and we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books in this issue .
al gore , `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> .
they 're going to go through and create a frame in which this is going to be discussed , because we need to support for all sides .
there must be a lot to come together .
this is a wish .
a very <unk> wish we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , and i could choose , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , and i could choose that wish , `` i could pick it , <unk> , <unk> <unk> without the co2 .
this has the biggest impact .
if we do n't get this wish , the digging between the long , are terrible people in the long of the united states between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we do ?
for what kinds of <unk> ?
we need to use it for more sophisticated .
if countries are living in places like <unk> , you should not just talk about co2 .
they should talk to this <unk> talk , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous small money that are spent for these innovative ways .
we need <unk> , co2 , <unk> , <unk> and trade buildings that make a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we need to go through dialogue and <unk> , and also the things that will be done by the government .
it 's a more important wish , but i think we can satisfy it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better to understand -- first , can you give us a notion of this investment ?
bill gates : to conduct the simulation on a supercomputer , all of the great scientists , what we 've done , we need to test some 10 million , and even if we 're able to test our materials in a russian planet , it 's just
the difficult step is the first <unk> vehicle , more than finding more billion and the place of the first of it .
once the first done is when he <unk> , everything is quite clear , because the economy that is so different as well as we know them .
to understand the right thing : that means deep in the ground , which is almost like a vertical <unk> of nuclear <unk> , and then the process starts on top , and it goes down to the bottom ?
bg : right now . today you have to grow the reactor , and so many people have to go and have a lot of control that can go wrong . this thing you 're going to go wrong and stuff . it 's not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can turn it into 60 years -- think of a pillar of them -- they bury it , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there and <unk> 60 years , it 's done .
a <unk> , which is a solution for itself .
bg : yeah . well , you can go to it : you can sit there -- there 's a lot less waste with this method -- then take it and go into the next thing and burn it .
and we start to take off the waste , which is already exists in this <unk> or <unk> in the reactors . that 's our <unk> .
so that 's what the reactors was a problem , which is what we 're going to fill in our fill and it 's dramatically negative as the process .
but while they talked with different people about these world .
where is the biggest interest , so what really do ?
bg : so we 're not using us on a place , and there 's a lot of interesting things for all of it , and there 's big interest in russia , india , china , china , china -- i 've been met and talked about how to be the minister of the minister and talked about how this is
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese did .
this is a nuance of a thing that was done .
this is a more important step further , but it 's like a faster , and some countries have built this building , so everybody , who has a rapid reactor , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea : <unk> and probability is actually going into life ?
bg : now we need one of these <unk> things , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to build and then take 20 years .
this is like the <unk> , which has shown us the <unk> , which we need to do with .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that 's a big wish , could be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of firms today , and we need hundreds of , and we need hundreds of , which is the same thing that work to work that are going to work for the pilots , for that .
and it would be the best if it can do several , because you could use a mixture of it .
we need a solution .
is the great possible breakthroughs , is this the largest that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it would be without the <unk> , but it 's still much more important .
there are other innovative companies .
you know , we do n't know their work is so good like this , but there 's the <unk> way that 's another approach .
there 's a <unk> <unk> , which seems something hard , but maybe that 's going to tell us about us .
and so there are different , but the nice thing is that a million times a million times as a <unk> , we say , a <unk> , and that 's the radiation , the potential and the cost , the potential , and other things , and other things .
if that does n't work what ?
do we have to be a <unk> , to try to make the <unk> stable stable ?
bg : if you get into this situation , it 's like a lot of heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or anything .
there 's an <unk> called <unk> , which is called different techniques to fit global or 30 years to be used to <unk> us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we do n't need it .
some people say , you should n't work on insurance , because it might be a real way , so you 're going to eat , because you know that one is going to save the <unk> .
i do n't know if you 're smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there 's a discourse in terms of whether it should be done , if things should be faster , or these innovation needs more than we expect .
<unk> : do you have a or two sentences for the , to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the scientific arguments do , are very little .
tell you that there are negative effects that are going to do with the clouds ?
there are very , very few things that are going to tell you that there are a chance of a million .
the <unk> here is so similar to aids .
you do it , and you 'll pay for it very much later .
and so the idea is , if you have all kinds of problems , in something that you 've been going to do -- and it 's not the <unk> report , and there 's not the worst story , and there 's people in the rich world , and says , okay , that 's not a big <unk>
the fact is that this uncertainty should be concerned .
but my dream here is that if you can do it the same thing , and at the same time , the amount of co2 , i do n't know that it 's not to do it , but i 'm going to do it , but i 'm going to do it , but i 'm going to accept it , but i 'm going to accept it , but i 'm going to accept it , but i 'm going to accept it , but i 'm going to accept it , because it 's going to accept it , because it 's cheaper , because it 's cheaper than the previous method .
and that would be the answer to the <unk> argument , that if you 're using all of these time and energy about the co2 , all the other goals of malaria , which is the <unk> of malaria , it 's a dumb waste of resources to invest in it while it can do better things that we can do better .
bg : well , the actual price for the research -- let 's tell the u.s. spending 10 billion per year than you do today -- that 's not so dramatic .
there 's no matter of other things .
you then come up with big <unk> , and here is sensible people , if you have something that is not economic , and it 's trying to finance that , for me , for me , to be most of waste .
it 's because you 're very quickly , and funded the learning process , and i think we should be more things that have more things that have the potential , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> you get a very high <unk> , it 's just the rich can keep up .
i mean , everyone of us here could spend five times for our energy without changing your lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> thinks .
his new <unk> is now , `` why will not have the research that do n't have to do ? ''
it 's still going to be , because of his previous stories , but he has understood that that 's a very <unk> group and so he 's going to be the <unk> .
and this is a line i think i think of appropriate .
the research , it is nuts , just how much the <unk> .
bill , i think i 'm going to speak for all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all the people , i 'm hoping that your wish is true . many , many , thank you .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> wrote a <unk> called `` the <unk> . ''
the idea is quite simple . <unk> need to <unk> the biggest way of <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about <unk> tape , about <unk> <unk> , about <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and , although it 's just really hard , it 's really hard to collaborate very quickly ,
and so i thought that this is a interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since , i 've done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there is something about what deep impressions in the world of collaboration and i want to share some of them .
usually , most people are looking at the challenge to orient .
you talk about how it will look like it 's going to be <unk> .
and then they invest a little bit of time and organization , and they started <unk> .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> of the <unk> environment .
and finally , before they do n't have time , someone takes the marshmallow , and they sit down the <unk> on the top , come back , `` <unk> , '' they 're <unk> .
but then , almost , almost always , is that it 's going to be <unk> , because the weight of the <unk> is going to be the whole thing and <unk> .
there are a number of people who have a lot of <unk> <unk> than others , and under the worst .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused , they 're confused and producing <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams of <unk> , <unk> , and under the best <unk> of the <unk> .
and this is pretty amazing .
and what peter wrote us , they do n't have a highest towers , but also the most interesting structure of all .
what you might ask is : how ? why ? what ? what ?
and peter said , `` none of the children are invested in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . ''
they do n't invest time in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and it 's that <unk> were trained , who were going to find a real plan , ok .
and it 's expected .
what happens when they put the marshmallow on the top , they have no time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what 's going to do things is that they begin with the marshmallow , and then build prototypes , successful prototypes , and so that they 're <unk> the opportunity to repair <unk> prototypes .
now , <unk> recognize these kinds of collaboration as a core of the <unk> .
and with each trial , the children get immediate feedback , which works and not .
so the performance is working with prototypes , but we see how different teams are doing .
the average for most of them is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers are more , but not a lot , <unk> are better than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architect and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest , what i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns to build the key to stable structures .
ceos are something about average . but this will be interesting .
you 're going to be a serious <unk> on the team , you get significant better .
it 's incredible . you see , and see this team will win .
you can predict this . why is this ?
because they have special skills .
they supervise the process , they understand him .
and this team , that regulates the work of the work of the teams of the teams .
useful skills and <unk> and the combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , you have a typical way , you can get six , the stable structures .
i tried something very exciting .
i thought we 're going to get the <unk> .
so i offered a <unk> $ <unk> for the winners .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team .
if anyone had built a <unk> high industry , he would have worn at home .
so is it not interesting that high tech have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what do you think ?
now , they did the advantage of the <unk> .
so in the same time , bad team of the best .
they brought the highest construction in the least of the time .
there are <unk> lessons for us , which nature of the <unk> and success .
they like questions : why would anyone actually invest a <unk> ?
the reason is , i 'm <unk> digital tools , to help teams , cars , video games and <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> is doing , they helps to identify hidden assumptions .
because open , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or <unk> , the right piece of machine .
and this is the value of this experience that this simple exercise .
and those of them who are interested in , you can visit <unk> .
it 's a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples from all world , how people are optimize the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , the construction is a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all focus on our senses , and that we use our thinking about how our emotions and our work , in the challenge that we have .
and sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is everything that it needs to get us from one `` <unk> '' -- for a `` <unk> . ''
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we do this as a machine .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that 's a time machine .
and everybody in this room must .
and you can go in the past , you can go in the future ; you can not stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i 've been asked my friends in last time , and they wanted to go into the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back in the time before it had cars or twitter or `` america . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that i 'm kind of <unk> to nostalgia .
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to be in the past , and not because i 'm a <unk> .
it 's because we do n't go back to this planet .
so i want to go in this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most magnificent time that there 's ever been on this planet , which is what scale they do : health , wealth , opportunities , opportunities .
there was never been a time like this .
my <unk> died when they were 60 .
my grandparents did this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the iraq .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not once people like us , because this is a greater thing than that .
a child that 's born today in new delhi is expected to live as long as the richest man on the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people in this planet .
they have the demographics of the earth on a way of shaped as it did n't have war .
they 're gone . they are gone .
we have them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , millions of people who are faced with millions of us .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anyone know , anyone still know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , which are successes of the scientific method .
and from my point of view , the scientific method is trying to look , whether it works , it does n't change it , one of the great risk of humanity .
so that 's good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , in spite of our achievements , there 's a billion people in this world to go hungry every day .
this number goes , and it goes very fast , and that 's a little bit .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to tell these world .
drinking water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , oil , and it 's soon , and if we do n't go from this chaos , we also disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food that will be able to feed billions of people without the country , to rape it .
i think we can be able to protect the world with energy that it does n't fall in .
i really believe that , and no , that 's not a minute .
but this is me wake up at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night . we have never been doing science improvement as well .
and we 've never been able to be able to be able to <unk> it , so we can see it as we can .
we 're amazing at the threshold , amazing events on many places , and yet , i think we have to find out of the u.k. , 300 years ago , to find a time where we have sustainable , in which we have to have progress in that things that we have to have progress on these things that we have to do about these things that we have about these things , when we have
the people lists themselves in their faith , and that 's so much that you ca n't free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a pretty true on your opinion , even a right on his opinion .
but you know what they do n't have right ?
they do n't have right on your own facts . <unk> , they do n't .
and i needed a while to figure out this .
about a decade ago , i wrote a article about <unk> for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed , at the resistance of resistance to the end of the most important thing in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what i should do , so i did n't do what i do , i wrote a article and the flight .
and soon , i wrote a paper about <unk> changed .
same thing , only bigger .
people played nuts .
so i also wrote a article , and i could n't understand why people thought , why they believed that molecules was a random way to <unk> a random way of nature .
but you know what i do . i wrote the article i did .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we call it , we 're eating food that 's okay .
but this article did me , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that 's because these <unk> , that <unk> did n't have any <unk> .
these were <unk> people , educated people , <unk> people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and this brought me so upset ...
but then i thought , you know what , let 's be honest .
we 're on a point where we do n't have the same relationship to progress in terms of the progress .
we 're talking about <unk> .
we 're ironic , with small <unk> , is that , `` progress . ''
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what reasons are .
we have trust in institutions in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science , and there 's no reason why not should be .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weapons , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who we believed that they were always right .
now , ask questions , demand for the evidence , demand for some evidence .
grab nothing as a given .
but now it 's going to be : if you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and it 's not good .
and i can say that we 're going to live in a epidemic of fear , how i 've never seen it , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story published a horrible story that <unk> <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
a lot of studies were done to see if that was true .
a lot of studies should be done ; it 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in the united states , from england , from canada , and they were all right , no connection , no .
it makes no difference . it does n't make a difference because we think we believe what we see to see what we see to see what is going to see what makes us feel .
we do n't believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> , which is , and i understand that , i think i do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was <unk> .
<unk> because the u.s. is one of the only countries on the world , which is the immunization of <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do it .
because someone 's <unk> here ?
did a single one in the audience ever see someone die ?
it does n't seem very often .
it happens in this country , but 160,000 times in the world .
these are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because this is not here , we can also increase it , and people like <unk> <unk> <unk> and messages from <unk> and illiteracy from <unk> and <unk> king live in <unk> .
and that can do it because they do n't connect and correlation .
you do n't understand that things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and it 's very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle of the middle .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he just created a bunch of other people .
he can save the life of <unk> , 500,000 children in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , this is good , besides that paul <unk> and is talking about how valuable they are , and that the people just should go to <unk> .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul 's going to talk about a public <unk> , he ca n't tell you without <unk> .
he gets to call calls home because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a <unk> .
i do n't need to say that , but this is an essential .
you go back to the diseases , you go back , horrible disease , and it 's going on .
we have now <unk> in this country .
and this will be worse , and quite soon , kids will die again , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just die of <unk> .
what about <unk> ? do we do this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine wrote a few weeks ago , and i said , i think i 'm a little bit too .
nobody said that before .
they did n't get her child to <unk> , not .
stable .
why ? because we have no <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country yesterday .
today , i do n't know , maybe someone morning in lagos , and it 's going to go on a plane , and then in the moment , it 's about ohio .
and in a few hours , it ends up and <unk> a car , and it 's coming from long beach , and he 's going to visit one of this <unk> night today .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a <unk> disease , and we do n't know that , because the world is so much .
this is the planet that we live . do n't do it as it 's not .
we love it in lying . we love it .
now , have you all taken your vitamins ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that helps you do it .
i know that they did that , because half of the americans do that every day .
you take the stuff , and you take a alternative cure , and it does n't make a difference how often we 're doing is useless .
the data came to the time .
they 're <unk> their urine . it 's almost never never do it .
this is okay , you want to see 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate a strong government . we have no confidence in the system .
and that should n't be <unk> . our health health care .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely cool and cool to us , and it can afford it .
so we run away , and where do we run ?
we go in the poor of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know that 's a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of images here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i do n't even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say , `` people in and say , `` what do you do ? let me do what they want .
so you feel good . ''
and you know what ? they have <unk> .
because it should n't matter whether it 's the education system that says , `` hmm , i 'm not paying the evidence of women , '' or some <unk> , who wants to treat their patients .
if you go to this path where it is , and the magic of magic and science , you 're going to lose a place that they do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , a lot of times more than the <unk> drugs we know that they can reduce the process of aids .
hundreds of thousand <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than each other of this disease .
do n't tell me that these things do n't have consequences .
they have it . they have it .
well , the <unk> epidemic that we 're right now is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> of the <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . you have to stop .
it 's a debate about words about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every <unk> , every <unk> , has been changed by people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no first <unk> . we did everything .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them did work and not .
we did n't get rid of what did n't work .
now we can do it , and of course there is risks , but we can do something like vitamin of rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people ,
this is n't going to do that ?
i have to say , i do n't understand that .
we stop <unk> food .
why do we do this ?
well , what i 'm listening is to all of them , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , we do n't want to do huge fields with a thing that is wrong .
we do n't want to patent companies .
we do n't want to make companies have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yeah , you have right . we fix it .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but it 's not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , moral , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we have a real dead , and it 's actually a lot of dead people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 'll grow 70 percent more food than the moment , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
ease . a <unk> .
they need it , and we do n't give it .
and why ? <unk> changed .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like <unk> .
<unk> is something that is half a billion people .
it 's like a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's <unk> .
it does n't have nutrients , it does n't have any protein , and scientists just build all that on it .
and then people could be food and would not be blind .
they would n't die , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it 's not <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , ask us , why do we fight it ?
because we do n't want to <unk> genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our appeal to greater food , better food , unique food .
it 's not about rice rice , it 's about getting people on life , and it will be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we do so much about how far we do about something that we think , not guilty , high-tech drugs .
there are no other description of what happens .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not worthy , and we need to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny entertainment , you might want to say , `` do you still want to be in this ridiculous time and go into the future ? ''
in everyone . i want to be on everyone .
it 's in the present moment , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this time time on everything we want .
we can <unk> them , where we want to do it , and we 're going to move it there , where we want to .
we need to lead to this conversation , and we need to think , but if we 're going to go into the time , and if we 're going to be glad we 're glad to have it to do it .
i know that we can be able to do it , and it 's something that 's something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a long time , i 've been interested in the <unk> . it might seem curious that a magician was interested in it , because , it 's because i 'm looking at it as a deception that 's going to be really important when someone believes in it ,
in other words , <unk> has been shown in some studies , which is the <unk> , and that 's because the person thinks of what 's going to be a <unk> or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , if the patient believes only enough , a measurable effect on the body that you 're called the <unk>
a deception will be true , because someone are like this .
so we can understand each other , and i 'm going to tell you a fundamental , simple magic trick .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that has been at least since the 1950s for children .
i 've learned it from the <unk> <unk> magic of the <unk> magic of the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for you and explain it .
and then i 'm going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
this <unk> that you can study ; my hand that you can study .
i 'm going to go through that <unk> , just like this .
i <unk> my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , i 'm going to get my wrist on this wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time moves anything . as long as i can see here , nothing in my sleeve , or come over .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully when everything goes good , that <unk> through my bare physical <unk> .
it 's actually a place that i could shake it , without sure that <unk> <unk> .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or it 's not , no <unk> , and you can see everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often <unk> a little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look at a bit , although it 's a very simple trick .
you know , many of you know here in the room here .
so this is the way it works .
i think that 's in my hand .
i say i <unk> my wrist to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , and that 's a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist on is that it 's the real secret of illusion .
and so in the moment , where i see my hand from the back , it 's moving to this fingers , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position that he 's <unk> .
great trick ?
there 's somebody sitting in the back , who did n't have childhood .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i <unk> myself , the fingers changes his position .
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't see three fingers : because the mind and the way that it is , you do n't know , two , three , three , but it looks like a group .
but this is actually not here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it 's going to be there , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , through my legs , which is there .
and when i leave my hand , the same thing that i 'm going to see , when i 'm hidden by this movement , that the fingers are <unk> .
i take this hand away . and this is the knife .
this trick can show your friends and friends . thank you .
well , what did that do with the <unk> ?
a year or so i read a study that was really focused on it .
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and that was a amazing thing .
it turns out this : if you offer a <unk> ball in a white ball , the shape of a <unk> , that 's just a round , white pill , which has a specific measurable effect .
but if you look at the shape , for example , for example , a smaller ball , for example , in a smaller ball , and these blue <unk> and a letter on it , it 's actually practical .
and that , although not any <unk> -- it 's just <unk> .
but a white ball is not so good as a blue ball .
what ? what did me get me .
but it turns out that it 's not everything .
if you take <unk> <unk> , the more than <unk> is every one form .
a colored capsule that is a <unk> and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the <unk> play a role .
a ball is less than three pills -- i can not remember the exact statistics . sorry .
but the key thing , ...
... it also play a role .
and the shape play a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> substance of a <unk> substance , which you have a patient .
this is a very powerful image in your head . it 's very much stronger than a white ball .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to show you a different time when we have a <unk> .
so the fact is that the white ball is not as well as well as the blue pill , which is not so good as a capsule that does n't be so good like the needle .
and nothing really has a really <unk> property . it 's just our belief that they spread into us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i 'm going to take something obvious , obviously , it 's obvious , and let 's see it a lot .
we know from the study that you have to grab to the needle when it should go .
this is a 18 inches long . it 's very , very <unk> . and i 'm going to do a little bit of a little <unk> .
this is my meat . it 's not <unk> special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
i 'm going to stick this needle in my skin , and go through it , until they migrate to the other side .
if it 's bad , if you fall easy in <unk> -- i have a bunch of friends on the hotel room , and some people who did n't know , and a woman has become a <unk> .
so i 'm going to propose if you 're going to be <unk> , look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i 'm going to do the first <unk> part of this .
you can see it , but you can also want to <unk> if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my meat starts to go on the lower part of my <unk> , i 'm just going to do a little <unk> .
i 'm really sorry . makes it nuts ?
and now , just a little bit about my skin and so again .
now we 're actually in the same situation we had the <unk> .
about .
but now , you ca n't count my fingers , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you you . this is two , three , four .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see it .
they say , `` okay , that 's not so stupid and <unk> itself , just to entertain us a few minutes . ''
well , i 'm going to show you .
how this looks like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people say , `` okay . i did n't see that . ''
the people in the <unk> will go in .
let me show you close to you .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can <unk> it .
sorry . if you 're going to be bad , you 're going to go away , do n't see it .
and the people , or the one that later , you see , say , `` well , you know , well , yeah , yeah , this is quite impressive , but if it would be real , and if it would be real , here 's a hole and there 's a hole and there 's really real , it would be
okay , let me take a little blood for you .
yeah , it 's .
now , typically , i would be able to get the needle out of it .
i would tell my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think , in this frame here , and with the intention , from a deception , i 'm going to go on , i 'll go to the needle and go from the stage .
we 're going to get a few times a few days .
i hope you 're looking at it . thank you .
everybody talks about happiness .
i have some people who count the number of the books that were published in the `` <unk> '' in the age of the last five years , and they had a lot more more .
there 's a huge wave of interest in happiness .
there are lots of <unk> .
everybody would like to make happier .
but in spite of all of these tides of work , there are several cognitive <unk> , which is that it makes it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive traps .
it 's true for <unk> , which is to think about their own happiness , and it 's for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we have so upset like everybody else .
the first of these fall of traps is a <unk> , complexities .
it turns out that the word for happiness is not a useful word , because we 're using it to many different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we could have access to it , but in the big and all the big and all of it we need to give up , and we 're going to take the complicated perspective , and we 'll think about what it is .
the second trap is a decision of experience and memory , and it 's actually that you 're going to be in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that 's the <unk> fact that we ca n't think about a situation that affects well-being , without knowing their meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to start with somebody from somebody who had a <unk> , which was a story . [ unclear ] , he said he 'd heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and the end of the recording was a <unk> sound .
and then he started to add up , really emotional , all the whole experience .
but that did n't .
and what it was ruined by the experience of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
it was not <unk> , because he was <unk> with a memory , the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep it .
what we really say is that we can think about us and other people could think of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> self , which lives in the present , and the present is , can be able to experience the past again , but basically the present .
it 's the <unk> self , the doctor 's doctor -- you know when the doctor asks , `` do it hurt if i <unk> it ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is , that 's the story and the story of our lives , and it 's the doctor , which asks the question , `` how did you know in the last time ? ''
or `` what was your journey after albania ? '' or so similar .
these are two very different units , the <unk> itself , and the <unk> itself , and the gap itself , and the two of the <unk> is part of the <unk> of the <unk> .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this starts with a fundamental response to our memories .
we do n't just tell stories when we 're going to tell us stories .
our memory tells us the stories that we have to keep our <unk> are given a story .
and let 's start with a example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who come to a painful .
i 'm not going to go into it . it 's no longer painful , but it was painful when these study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked , they were asked to report all over their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask , `` who are the two of the two ? ''
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has been <unk> more . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that had a child b , and more .
but now there is another question : `` how do this patients think that they were given ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient 's a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> than the patient b .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very powerful part of the story is , as you ends .
and no that stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clear .
but one of them is devastating than the other .
and the time that was worse , where the pain was at the end of his peak . it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and also a lot later , `` how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a than b to b .
well , this is a <unk> conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
from the <unk> point of view , b was clearly a <unk> time .
well , what you could do with the patient , and we did clinical trials , and it was done , and it was done , and it was actually done , and it was actually working , and it could actually be the <unk> of patient using the hose without <unk>
that 's going to be the patient , but only a bit less than before .
and if you do this a few minutes of power , that the <unk> self is a bad self , and you did n't have a much better self , because now you have the patient a better story about his experience .
so , what 's a story of a story ?
and this is true for the stories that the memory makes us and it is also the stories that we invent .
so , a story of <unk> is <unk> , great times and ends .
end of end is very , very important , and in this case , the end .
well , the <unk> itself is always alive .
it 's been the <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . it 's always lost .
i mean , most of the other moments of our life -- and i have this -- you know the psychological present time , when you have about three seconds , which means that there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there 's about 10 million of them .
most of them are completely ignored from the <unk> itself .
and yet , they 're going to get the idea that you should count , that while this moments of the <unk> is happening our lives .
it 's the limited resource we consume in this world .
and as we use it , but that 's not the story that makes the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> ourselves and the <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the time of time .
from the <unk> self , if you have a vacation and the second week , the second week is exactly how the first , the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
it does n't work for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation is barely more likely to get more than the <unk> vacation , because there 's no new memories .
they did n't change the story .
and in this way , it 's actually the critical variable that is different from a <unk> itself , and time has a little impact on this story .
well , the <unk> self itself is more than remember and tell stories .
it 's actually one of the decisions , because if you have a patient who had two <unk> in two different surgeons , and you can decide , which is the memory that 's the vote , which is less bad , who will be chosen .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this election .
in fact , we do n't vote between <unk> . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think of the future , we do n't think about our future .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> itself as a <unk> itself .
i think that if we 're going to do a lot of disease , that is what we 're going on vacation with vacation services in services .
and that 's a bit difficult to justify that , i think .
i mean , how much of our memories of our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of the <unk> self .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation , which we did a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation , which i 've ever had , and i think relatively often in the relationship , how often i think ,
and i probably have taken from my memory of these <unk> journey , i would say about 25,000 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i 've ever taken the dodo <unk> with 600 images i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and this is a half a year .
there is a clue to give it .
well , i like a little bit , you know , how much , i have a <unk> of memories , but even if you do it a real question , why do we give you the memories of how much weight in the <unk> of the weight we give
and so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that the end of the <unk> , you know , on the end of the images , you 're going to hear their pictures , and they get a <unk> drug , so they 're going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you want to pick a different vacation , there 's a conflict between your two types of self , and you need to think about how they do n't think about how they do n't think about it , because if you think about it , and if you think about it , and if they 're thinking in the sense of time , and if you can think of them in terms of memory , you know , you know ,
why we chose the <unk> that we chose is a problem that is with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two species of self are going to throw two ideas from happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can apply to , one per capita itself .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask , how happy are the moments of the life in life ?
and they 're all very complicated for moments ,
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and , by the way , we 're very good idea from the happiness of the <unk> self .
if you ask for the happiness of happiness , it 's a very different thing .
it 's not what happy a person lives .
it 's like being satisfied or <unk> that person thinks about their lives .
very different concept .
everybody who do n't different things that are not different to the study of happiness , and i belong to a lot of researchers about the study of happiness , the study of happiness .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self , and the happiness of the <unk> self is recognized in the last few years , and now you try to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a worldwide survey , in the half of a million people asked about what they think about their lives and over their experiences , and there were other efforts to
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the two ways of learning .
and the main main lesson that we , i think , is that they 're really different .
you can know how someone is with his life , and i do n't think about how happy he live alive and vice versa .
only about to share a hint of correlation that correlation is about <unk> .
what that means that if you would meet someone , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would know about the size ?
well , you would know something about your size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone is his life than eight miles of 10 times , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> .
so correlation is <unk> .
we know something about what happiness of the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is not being satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is dominant .
so if you 're lucky to maximize the two types of other ways , you 're going to do very different things .
and the conclusion of what i 've told here is that we really do n't think of happiness really , as a muscle behavior .
it 's a completely different concept .
well , really , a second reason , a other reason that we ca n't think about happiness is that we do n't pay attention to the same things that we think about life and when we 're living .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to get in california , you 're not going to get the right answer .
if you ask this question , you know that people must be happier in california when they 're going to live in ohio .
and what 's happening is that if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it 's not very important for the <unk> itself , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to the end of california .
and it 's kind of really interesting to track what happens with people who go to california , to become happier .
well , your <unk> self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen , you will think that you 're happier , because if you 're going to think about how terrible the weather is in ohio , and they will feel that they have made the right decision .
it 's very hard to think about well-being , and i hope , i have a hint of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
well , when we have a few weeks ago , you know , you know , it was a pretty interesting result , which came from this <unk> survey .
is something that you can be able to give us , because they have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most exciting thing that we have found in the <unk> survey is a number that we did n't have to find it .
we found it in the happiness of the <unk> self .
if we looked at it like emotions with the income .
and it turns out that under a decade of 60,000 dollars a year for americans , and that 's a very big sample of americans , about 10 , but it 's a big representative sample under a income .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they will get more happy , the poorer .
we get a absolutely <unk> line .
i mean , i 've seen so flat lines .
and what happens is obviously that money is not a <unk> failure , but that lack of money is certainly not enough , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the spirit of the other self , the <unk> self , they get another story .
the more money you make it , it 's the <unk> .
it 's not for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american campaign , it 's about life , freedom , to happiness .
if people would take this effect seriously , i mean , it seems to turn it in your head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country actually would be much like the seriously ?
dk : you know , i think there 's an <unk> for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , you 're going on and in other countries .
the people who acknowledge they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a long time , and people will discuss whether they want to study <unk> , so we need to study this discussion pretty soon .
as you 're lucky , very different ways to think about how you think about it , or whether they think about the <unk> itself .
this will affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you 're dealing with measuring the population of the population .
it will be , i think , in the next few decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this issue is going to be , or i should be the most exciting political debate about the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane bitter . i make video games .
i 'm going to get <unk> for 10 years , and my goal is for the next decade , it 's just as easy to save the world in the reality , how to save them .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all more time to spend greater and <unk> play .
now , we spend three billion hours a week .
some of them might think , `` this is a whole amount of time for games . ''
maybe a lot of time when you think about how many problems we need to fix the real world .
but actually , my research in the future , is exactly the opposite of the future .
three billion hours per week not close enough to solve problems of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced , if we want to survive the next century , we need to increase the time in 2030 .
i have computing that it took time in the 21st billion hours a week .
this might first be a little bit more <unk> , so i think , if we 're going to solve problems like hunger , climate change , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global , global , global billion hours a week .
no , i mean , i mean it seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty straightforward , why i believe that games are so important for survival of the human species in the future .
this is a picture of the photographer <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to catch the emotions in games . so he has a camera on the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you 're not a player , you may not afford some of the <unk> in this picture .
you probably see this feeling for urgency , something , but also highly concentrations , actually a very difficult problem .
if you 're playing , you see some <unk> here , which is the <unk> eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows suggests .
this is a player that is on the outskirts of a <unk> .
oh , you know this . ok. good . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that is so much positive that they did n't know before .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you reach it , you 're shocked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something . that 's a <unk> victory .
this players is short to a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces in the world , if we take the <unk> of the next century , the face of that struggle on the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately we look at this face in real life when we face the difficult problems .
i call it as the `` in life i am bad , '' and it 's my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
and this is me , i 'm like that in life i am bad .
this is a graffiti in my former <unk> home in berkeley , california , and where i was in my ph.d , and i was going to be better than in play in play in play in play in play .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we 're not so good as well .
and i 'm not just a good good , although that 's probably .
we 're getting more . i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean
if we 're in a <unk> , i think many of us can turn ourselves in our best version , and instantly <unk> , the problem trying to solve the problem as long as long as a result .
and in reality , if we fail , if we get on obstacles , we 're actually feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> . we feel threatened , maybe maybe depressed or <unk> , or <unk> .
and these feelings have never , if we play games , there are just not a way .
and this is what i wanted to study as a <unk> .
why is it impossible to play , to think , you could n't get everything ?
how can we create these emotions from reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment for the collaborative problem .
and i noticed some things that are going to do in <unk> <unk> .
so first , first of this <unk> , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters who are willing to be willing to do , and instantly it immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission , which is perfect to your current level , right ?
so do you create that .
they do never get a task that you ca n't fix them .
but always on the edge of your skills , so you need to work , but there is no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not around , and you 're <unk> . there are always specific to do something important .
and there 's tons of employees .
where they go to , hundreds of people who work with you to work with their epic mission .
and we did n't have this real life on the real life , that feeling that it 's willing to be willing to stand up with a <unk> .
also , there is this <unk> story , this inspiring story , why we are and what we have .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
you have heard about `` <unk> , '' or <unk> , or <unk> intelligence .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i 'm not going to talk about it , there 's a <unk> idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i do n't get into the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of <unk> like the world of warcraft is that it 's such an example of the edge of the edge of a <unk> , that we would rather spend our whole time in these <unk> .
they 're just better than the reality .
to today , all the world of <unk> combined with <unk> million years , to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that 's not something bad .
it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go .
so the first <unk> <unk> .
okay , so if we talk about how much time we 're going to spend on play with play , it makes sense , if you 're going to do it in terms of the human development in terms of eyes , which is extraordinarily .
but again , it turns out , because it turns out we 're using this whole time to play , actually , what we 're able to be able to do as people .
we 're going to develop us a lot of different .
this is the truth . i think i think .
let 's look at this interesting statistics , which recently published a researcher in the researchers , the average man of the country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country in a country with <unk> for <unk> to the 21st .
so 10,000 hours , a very interesting number , two reasons .
first , for children , for children , for children in the united states , <unk> hours are the exact <unk> , which they spend in school , from the five grade , from the five grade for high school , when you do n't do n't ,
so we have a complete complete <unk> building on the young people just to learn what it means to be a good player , how everything else they learn to school .
and maybe some of you have the new book from malcolm <unk> , `` <unk> . ''
so you know his theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research of <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> of a matter of a matter of a matter to the 21st century , we 're going to <unk> it .
we 're going to be so good at what the most important people of the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what are the player 's <unk> ? ''
because if we could figure out that , we would have been able to have a <unk> human potential .
so many people we have in the world , at least one hour per day in the world .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary good in `` something . ''
and the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinary good in what are still .
if you have n't heard it .
the <unk> developed <unk> , the energy rescue , and work on <unk> , instead of working on the <unk> , with all the world , especially in india , china , china , china , china , china , china , china ,
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a lot of a billion players .
so i started to start thinking about what it is to do this games .
here are four things i found . first of the first thing .
okay , now imagine the extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the craving to do something immediately , a barrier to the belief that we have a <unk> hope on success .
players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it 's always worth to try and be the same .
players do n't sit around .
players are masters in the spiders of social nets .
there 's a lot of more interesting research , which we show you to do more than we 've played with them , even if they were <unk> .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of confidence requires a game .
we trust that someone has spent time , that the rules are going to be <unk> that we have the same goal , and to stay up to the <unk> .
so the games are going to grow up by interactions , trust and each other .
as a result , we 're building stronger social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week , like a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we 're actually happier , it 's hard to work hard than if we do , or nothing .
and we know that we 're going to take human beings , if we do it , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , in <unk> ,
players love to be part of the awe of missions of being <unk> .
here 's a <unk> , to back to the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second , the second , the largest world 's largest world , almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about world of warcraft in the internet than about some other world in any other issue of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
so , these are four superpowers to lead to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
there are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i 'm trying to do it .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , `` we 're going to be able to be less than one <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and that 's an economist , so it 's logical .
and he says ...
not like i ... i think i 'm playing games , i 'm a little bit more <unk> .
so he says that it makes sense , because players can reach more in <unk> more than real life .
they can play greater social bonds of social bonds than in real life , they get more feedback and reward .
so , he says it 's totally logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in real time .
i just go to it , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event , the 2,500 years ago .
there are these <unk> cube , from <unk> . you know ?
this fantastic <unk> was <unk> .
and these were the first of people developed <unk> .
and when they 're familiar with the work of old greek <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> as a famine .
supposedly , there was such a great famine , which was the king of <unk> decided to come to a crazy idea .
people cheated . people fought .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so , they invented <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy . they would be eating a day . you would play .
and they would be so much to the <unk> of what games are so fascinating , and with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing too .
and then , the next day , you 'd play . and you would eat .
and according to the <unk> , they survived this famine for this famine , by a day , and they were eating in a day .
so , i think we 're playing games today .
we 're going to put games to escape the suffering of real world .
we 're going to play games to try and not necessarily do it in the real world , especially in real life , and we get us out of the play .
but that does n't be the end .
this is the exciting thing .
according to <unk> , the famine was not better , so the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they played a <unk> , and the winner had to turn into a <unk> adventure .
she was <unk> , and they were looking for a new home , and they were just so many people back to survive , and they were looking at the rest after the rest they could thrive .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show shows that the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , the same of the same dna like the old <unk> .
and so scientists came up to the notion that <unk> is actually true .
and geologists found the evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years ago .
so could this crazy story .
and maybe they did n't saved her people through games for a few years , and then they learned so much about the different civilization .
so , we can also .
we 're going to play in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played <unk> 18 years , we play with 16 years .
i think we 're willing to play for our own <unk> .
so , they sent half their civilization on a new world , and so i take my 21st billion <unk> per week .
and we should <unk> that half of us have spent a hour of us every day with play with play , until we have solved the problems of real world .
i know they 're going to ask , `` how do we fix problems in games ? '' and right now , i have my work in the last few years of the future .
we have this <unk> in our office in palo alto , it 's when we should understand the future .
we do n't want to try to tell the future before .
what we want to create is the future .
we want to imagine the best result , and then people <unk> that idea in the reality .
we put in <unk> <unk> and give people to reach them .
and i 'm going to show you three games i designed to try to try to try to make people in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where they need to get a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , and it 's actually a real life , and if you 're doing it , and if you 're going to be able to live , how much oil is <unk> , whether it 's going to be <unk> , whether it was going to be <unk> , and they need to make it
we have <unk> this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we have accompanied them since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a shift experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment or because we should .
but if you 're in a <unk> adventure , and they say , `` we 're going to go from it . ''
this is an amazing adventure to you .
do you find out how they would survive , most of our players have planted the game in playing habits .
so for the next <unk> , we have a larger , higher goal .
we have a game called <unk> .
and then , a computation is a <unk> that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer called `` global <unk> <unk> . ''
the call on players , on top , we have almost like a `` <unk> . ''
you know jerry <unk> , where there 's the <unk> , they have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of five people , we say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it 's our task , the future , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game of eight weeks .
they found 500 things that you can read if they call `` <unk> . ''
and the last game we 're going to go on the three . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you go to the game , they get from the world bank , the <unk> of the social <unk> , at 2010 .
we 're working with universities in all sub-saharan africa , and they 're learning to learn social services .
we have a comic book . we have <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and <unk> .
i 'd like to invite you all of these game with young people , everywhere in the world , especially in the world , especially in the world , especially in the world , especially in the world , all in the world , especially in their own social enterprise , to save the world .
i 'll go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree , that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to share narrow social nets , <unk> and the craving to <unk> meaning .
i 'm hoping we 're going to play together in this planet to survive another century .
and i hope you will play with play and play .
if i put in the next decade , i 'm sure to two things that we can create any <unk> future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let 's start the <unk> play .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something , which is a few months ago , a story for <unk> .
i always always always <unk> my <unk> <unk> , but i was done with the <unk> of the <unk> , and i was running in my life that i have never been in my life , which is really good , which is really good .
i read you the post .

i had this list of a friend of my friend , and i had to remind you , it seemed like this , but i did n't get to <unk> , and i could n't stop <unk> , and i had to stop looking at this <unk> , and i 'd go to that <unk> <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , i thought that the copy must be very old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early '80s , when i started working with elementary school , and i started to build my self outside of my family community , and it also also also , in terms of other children , and the rest of the world around me .
and so , thanks to me , i did n't used to use a <unk> .
if i would have this post seriously , i would be born in a world who would perceive me as a person who can see as a person who can be able to be working in <unk> , but i 'm going to do it for the chances i 've experienced ,
so i immediately got to <unk> the <unk> of 2009 , and expected i find a <unk> contribution .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it 's not a lot better .
in particular , the last two words in the other two words are <unk> , `` <unk> '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language influenced our thinking and how we see the world and people see around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the crime , really believed that the deep force has a huge force , because what you can <unk> ,
so , what do we want to <unk> -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
in fact , only one people have been <unk> as a child , you know , do you know , you know , they 're familiar , and they 're <unk> .
would n't it be nice to open your doors ?
a man who has opened up to me , my pediatrician was my friends in <unk> in <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , how they can think , most of americans do n't mean , so he 's been called dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> was very <unk> and was just <unk> for children with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to be able to make sure that <unk> exercises with these <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- you know , you know , you know , to build my <unk> , and i have <unk> it . i hated them . i hated her . i hated it .
and imagine , i even have a <unk> child with dr. p. art , and i tried to stop these exercises , without success .
and one day he was looking at one of my exercises -- these exercises were <unk> , and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , <unk> and young girl , you 're going to pull one day of one day .
and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
this was of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , by dr. <unk> , i did n't want to do the exercises in the moment , but he actually brought me to see my daily <unk> in the middle of the ward . but he actually brought me to see my daily <unk> .
and i 'm going to talk about how much his vision of myself and <unk> young girl has shaped my impressions , and i could imagine as a big , powerful , powerful and <unk> man .
this is just a example of many , how adults can apply the imagination of a child .
but as a result of examples of the <unk> evidence , it gives us our language not a room , imagine something that we would all wish to see every single one , to see each other people .
our language <unk> the social changes who were involved in many cases in a technological change .
of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , `` my legs , my legs , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of aging , who allow people to use their ability to develop their own learning , not to talk about the other <unk> , ''
so , maybe this technology is more important , because it has always a different truth , which is that every human society can be very <unk> and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability to attract -- that 's a interesting story , because people always told me about it , and i 'm going to tell you about it , and i 'm going to do something that i 've never felt for me , and i 'm always felt very excited about it , and i 'm always felt very excited about it , and i 'm always felt very excited about it , and i 'm always comfortable with the questions of people , and i think i think i understand why .
and this sentence from alternative failure in the idea of belief in the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to
but the truth is that we change us . of course we have the challenge of the challenge , whether it 's physical , emotionally or even both .
and i 'm saying that this is good .
adversities no obstacle that we need to get <unk> to come to our lives .
dilemma is just to our lives .
and i tend to know , adversities than my shadows .
sometimes i realize that he 's very mind , sometimes it 's barely to see , but it 's always time .
and i do n't want to do the impact , or the heavy of the <unk> of a people .
there 's adversities , and challenges , and these are real , and every person is different from it , but the question is not to be able to be adversities , but it 's not how we go .
so we 're not responsible for the people we love to keep <unk> , but they also pay attention to it .
and we do n't think of our children , if we do n't give them to adapt .
you have to know two things : to one of the medical fact , a long time , a lot of the social opinion , whether i 'm an education or not .
and to be true , the only thing that i have to do is , with the challenge i had to put myself apart , is that the world is constantly thinking , it could describe me with this mission .
in our wish to protect people who are looking at the heart , and the cool truth about their medical response to their own medical response to their own medical response to their own medical response to their own medical response to the quality of the quality of the quality of quality , and even a prediction to the quality of the quality , we have to keep the foundation that we do n't have to be disabled .
maybe this is the current concept , which is just going to be the <unk> , and how we repair the repair for every single one of a greater disability than the arts .
if we do n't treat people , and not all its forces , and you acknowledge , we 're going to be able to be in the natural struggle , which maybe maybe another disease .
we <unk> a people who has a value for our society .
so we need to look at the <unk> , and focus on the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it 's between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> .
we should not be <unk> times of times of war or mistrust , we should not try to avoid them under the carpet , but it 's about changing opportunities .
it might seem to be something to remind you that we do n't necessarily necessarily overcome adversities , but that we 're going to be open to the <unk> for the <unk> to use a <unk> .
and maybe we can create it , adversities as a natural , coherent and useful , and useful useful , and useful , and make us feel as a <unk> .
in this year , we split 200 of the birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote a million years ago , darwin , in my eyes , something very true in human character ,
i would make it like this : not the most powerful way , and not the <unk> of his way , but the ones that can be changing .
it 's associated with conflicts .
not only from darwin , we know that the ability to survive , and <unk> , and <unk> , from the struggle of human spirit .
so again , change and destruction are the great great skills of people .
and maybe we know , from what wood we 're <unk> , if we 're really <unk> .
maybe that 's the idea of adversities , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can pay something like ourselves .
we can struggle for a new meaning , which is the other thing .
maybe we might be adversities as change .
adversities for a change that we do n't have adapted to .
i think the biggest harm we have to have to believe that we should be normal .
once , who is normal ?
there is no normal normal .
there 's the typical . but it 's not the normal way , and if you would understand these poor , gray person , if it could really do it ?
i think , not .
it would be great when we 're going to be a paradigm of the normal , or the strength , to identify it , and we can release the forces of a lot of children , and we invite you to have the forces of a lot of children , and they invite you to have a very much of children , and they invite their very special skills in society .
in fact , <unk> has found that we have people who have a <unk> of our society and make a contribution .
there are evidence that are <unk> <unk> years ago , and people with severe physical therapists and people who have been rid of it , and that 's what the purpose of the people were going to be valuable to society .
they did n't look at these people as <unk> and useless , they were treated with something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in the city i grew up in the <unk> in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there in a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear how a guy says , `` well , if that 's not <unk> . ''
and i 'll check myself and see the older man . i did n't know who he is .
and i said , `` pardon , sir , we know ? i ca n't remember it . ''
and he said , `` well , you can not remember me .
when i saw her first time , i did it from your mom . ''
oh , so .
and of course , it 's done it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i only had from stories of my mom , because i was , of course , in my birthday , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> magazine was in vacation , and so my parents knew my husband who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet on her , and i only had a bunch of toes at the other foot , he had the <unk> , that stranger had to get the bad news .
and he said to me , `` i had to tell your parents who would never walk , and never never be so much like other children or that you could never live a <unk> lives , and since it 's just going to be lying . ''
really , i found that i 've been collected by my entire childhood , if i was won in the second class , if i was in the second grade , whether i had my scholarship <unk> , and he used to teach them to teach his students to teach his students to teach his students to teach his students , and he used to teach his students , <unk> from the
and he called this part of his <unk> factor that the potential of human willing .
you can not know enough to be enough to be enough of this factor for the quality of life .
and dr. <unk> told , he said , `` i 've learned that kids say , if they 're not always going to keep a little support , if you get kids , if you can get children , you can get a lot of them , you can do a lot of them . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has changed .
he had understood that medical diagnosis , and how anyone are doing that , two different things are .
and i have changed my mind in the age of time , if they had asked me in old 15 years , if i had my prostheses to legs from meat and bone , i had no second .
i wanted to be used to that time .
if you ask me , i 'm not so sure .
and this is happened , because i 've had something like my legs , and not even in this experiences .
and maybe that change could happen , because i 've had a lot of people who have created my doors , rather than to see people who were <unk> , or to be a idea of myself .
you just need to see it 's just a man who can show you how you can <unk> your forces , and they are .
if you allow somebody to activate your own , human mind , human mind is so <unk> -- if you create that , and for a critical moment , they 're opening up to the door , they 're very good teachers .
they 're bringing them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means to create something that in a is that the potential <unk> .
again , the potential is the potential to this ?
in the '60s , in britain , in the '60s , in the '60s , in the '60s , <unk> was turned into <unk> .
they call this `` <unk> <unk> '' in the united states .
students are <unk> .
and the a student will <unk> <unk> , get the better teachers , etc .
and then they have a <unk> of students with a good period of students , and i said , `` very good , '' they were very smart , and after these three months .
and of course , it 's the heart of listening to the heart of the heart of the <unk> , it 's only enough .
and it was just the three months .
but only the ones who were still in school -- besides the students who had <unk> school .
most importantly , the teachers was not <unk> .
teachers did n't know that something changed .
it 's just been told that the student is , and that 's the student of the class , and they have taught them something .
the only disability is a real mind that has been a real mind that has broken , has no hope . he finds nothing more . he 's missing our natural , boring curiosity . and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we create it , the human spirit of mind , still continue to hope , and other people to find itself , and then we put our forces really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i 'd like to end up with a poem that was responsible for a <unk> poet named <unk> <unk> , and my friend says , `` the god who knows four words , '' not the god knows , not the god knows , not the god knows , not the god knows , not the god knows , not the god knows , not just the god , but it 's only going to just say , `` you know , it always says , <unk> , dance .
come , dance with me . thank you .
