when steve lopez , funny times , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , a day , a day of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , tortured , homeless , homeless , who had just a violin who had only two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because of <unk> article about it later , again , this was a book , that 's a book , that 's a book that was <unk> , with robert <unk> , and jamie <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and that 's the fundamental career in his seminal career ,
<unk> left , at the end of a <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived as a <unk> in the streets of <unk> <unk> in los angeles .
i recommend you to read all the book , to read , or to read about the film , not just understand the great bond , which is between these two men , but also , like the music that was going to make the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that was allowed to get the <unk> , <unk> way to get the <unk> .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the <unk> disney hall .
he had a map of <unk> and <unk> symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he talked in a very <unk> and <unk> clay , and hillary clinton , and in the way the dodgers would never make it in the baseball world , and that 's all of the first part of the first part of the first part of the first part of the first part of the first part of the first part of the <unk> <unk> fourth program .
and we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got a email in the state , which is that <unk> was interested in me .
i need to mention saying that <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it was already treated with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been <unk> him .
and as a result , he 's now <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , and these are sometimes so bad , and he 's going to be in the streets of the streets of <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in exactly like a <unk> , <unk> , when we started with the first grade in walt disney grade , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he talked about invisible blog , smoke and smoke , and what someone wanted to poison in sleep .
i had scared , not the way , but i had scared that i could lose it in a region , and that i could destroy his relationship to violin when i started to talk about <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , in <unk> eyes , a <unk> change in <unk> .
it was as though he stood under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose thought was a catalyst .
<unk> <unk> shaped in understanding in a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracle took his violin , and he started to play some clips of <unk> <unk> , and i asked me to play her , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started talking about music , started from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he did n't just know a <unk> knowledge of music , but it was also a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding of the understanding of the <unk> in los angeles .
by making music and talking about music , from this <unk> , confused man , who had fallen by the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> musicians , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for <unk> , music is <unk> health .
because the music allows him to make his thoughts and divide with the imagination of imagination and creativity in something real suffering .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that this is the natural creature of art .
and this is the reason why we make music : so we have something that we have in all , deep , our senses , through our artistic lens through our creativity ,
and the reality of the expression is that all of us all of us all , and moves , inspire and together .
what <unk> <unk> , so the music took back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music took him back in a family of musicians that understood his talent and the process of mind .
and i 'm going to go back with <unk> music , whether it 's wrong in terms of disney <unk> or <unk> , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i grew math musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i was stolen .
i hope you express me .
so i 've known a lot of fish .
i just loved two .
the first , this was more like a passionate style .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , a book on the ground .
what a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> to the secretary of the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could be able to get it to sell him .
and i had a relationship with multiple months .
one day , who called the boss of the company , and asked whether i could have an event with a event of the sustainability .
and of course , i said .
here was a company to solve what this incredible problem has become a chefs . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans as we have <unk> forests .
it 's hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the large fish who we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , it 's collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so , perhaps or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments . <unk> pollute the environment , most of you , most of you , and they 're inefficient , we have these images . a big disadvantage .
he has one <unk> of 15 .
that 's called 15 pounds of <unk> to get a pound .
not very sustainable .
it 's not very good .
so finally , finally a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to support them .
in the day of the event , i called the boss of the boss for the company .
call him cool .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right , you 're famous in the ocean that you do n't have a little bit . ''
`` this is true , '' he said . `` we 're so far out that the waste of the fish is distributed , not focused . ''
and then he added , `` we 're essentially a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
one thing to be great .
`` <unk> to what ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . put on .
and in this evening , i was in bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so , i called the next day , just for the event , it says ,
i said , `` well , what 's sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he did n't know that . he 's going to be <unk> .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a boatload answer , until i finally <unk> with the <unk> biologists .
let 's call him `` well . ''
`` frank , '' i said , `` what are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , `` well , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much percent of the person 's chicken is chicken ? ''
in the assumption of two percent .
`` well , this is about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what is sustainable to feed chicken ? ''
there was a long pause in the leadership and he said , `` there 's just <unk> in the world . ''
i 'm betting me from this fish .
no , not because i am a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that 's me .
no , i have <unk> in this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after this entertainment after chicken .
this second fish , that 's another kind of <unk> .
it 's romantic kind of <unk> , which you know , the better you know , you know , you know the fish you know .
i would have eaten it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish .
and she was <unk> in a way .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so good , after <unk> ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
call him miguel <unk> . in fact , he 's <unk> .
and no , he did n't have a <unk> , and he 's not a chef . at least in the way that they do , and i understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it 's near the <unk> of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're in the <unk> , which is basically wetlands .
they were doing that by the country .
they built these complicated of organizations , and they were abandoned water out of the country , and beyond the river .
well , they could n't make sure that was n't , not economically economically .
and green was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and there 's a spanish company in green company to be the country .
what did you do ?
they have the river of water .
they literally have <unk> <unk> .
instead of <unk> the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the channels .
she created a 11,000 acres of acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> , <unk> , and his company completely <unk> the environmental destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything .
you just stare at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and these dense , voluptuous , voluptuous .
i was there in a long time ago with miguel .
he 's an incredible fellow , three parts of charles darwin and a part of the <unk> .
okay ? so we were and fought ourselves through the wetlands , and i was <unk> and <unk> , and we 've got <unk> to my knee , and miguel is a <unk> .
and here he takes a rare <unk> landfill .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , there 's a pattern of <unk> that reminds him in the <unk> <unk> .
it turns out that miguel the largest part of his career spent in africa national park .
i asked him how he became a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i do nothing about fish .
i am a expert for relationships . ''
and then , he 's going to come and fall in more <unk> birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and you do n't understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of fish i had in the <unk> .
so , i was interrupted him , and i said , `` miguel , how does it get that your fish tastes so good ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , phytoplankton , which is incredible .
but what are your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he 's going to continue to tell me that it 's such a <unk> system that the fish would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , which is phytoplankton , the <unk> , which is what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there is no food .
most of a farm is , who does n't get your animals ?
later , i was going on in this site of <unk> , and i asked him , i said , `` well , `` for a place , which seems like that , of course , '' which seems like any farm .
in the moment , it was a <unk> , too .
and we <unk> the corner and we provided the most amazing sight of the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of thousands , a literally <unk> <unk> .
`` this is success , '' he said .
`` look at your <unk> , pink .
she <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> you do n't your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> in birds .
now , last year , these <unk> birds were 18 than 250 different ways .
it 's the largest and one of the most important private <unk> in all europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> that you want to have on a <unk> ? ''
he saved his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> , not heavy .
this is a <unk> network .
they 're eating the shrimp .
the shrimp are eating phytoplankton .
so the <unk> , the belly is the way the system . ''
okay , let 's change the mental . one farm that does n't get your animals and farm a farm that has its success of your legacy .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , they should n't even be the case of the war in the state of the war .
they breed in a city , where the <unk> <unk> is better for the <unk> .
there 's <unk> miles to farm .
and they 're going to fly <unk> kilometers .
they do that , because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had an kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , miguel , fly <unk> kilometers to the farm and fly fly back to the night ?
do you make the kids ? ''
he looked at me , when i had a song in the tubes of <unk> .
he said , `` no . they do that because food is better . ''
i did n't mentioned the skin of my loved fish , the delicious , and i do n't like a <unk> . i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm not going to leave you almost .
and yet , when i tried them in the restaurant , she did n't even miss the <unk> .
they were <unk> and in fact , as you would take a bites from the ocean .
i mentioned <unk> , and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin looks like a sponge .
she 's the last authority before getting something in the body .
she 's made of evolution to be <unk> <unk> . ''
and then he added , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . one farm who do n't get their fish . a farm , a farm that has its success in its success .
and then i realized , if he says , one farm that has no farm who has no <unk> , and he had a huge amount of , because the water comes from that farm from the river .
it 's a river , which led all the things that rivers are , they tend to provide them to make these chemical pollutants , by <unk> .
and when it was fighting by the system , and this leaves is clean , it 's clean up as a water .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only one farm , which is not betting their animals , not just a farm , which is a farm in your health , but a farm , which is literally a <unk> , and not only for this fish , but i do n't have .
because the water is <unk> , it 's in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to do it , and should you do it , because these <unk> , which is also telling me .
you could say that you 're a recipe for the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
now , what we need is a radical new concept of agriculture , from agriculture in which food is really <unk> .
but for many people , this is a little bit .
we 're not <unk> , we 're <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that the things are , you know , someone 's good food , someone says , `` hey , '' and hey , people , i love pink flamingos , but how do you feed the world ?
how will you feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we do n't produce enough calories to produce the world more than feed .
one billion people will be dying today .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of <unk> illumination in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i do n't like this question because they 've got the logic of our <unk> .
<unk> grain on <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , chemicals on earth , <unk> on fish , chicken in fish , and the whole time has just dying , `` if we feed more people , how much people can be cheaper . ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the business business of the american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> capital that allows exactly this production .
it 's not a wall , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not by <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> country , not by pump , but by <unk> water , not by chainsaw , but not by <unk> and nets , and they do n't get in <unk> and nets .
you want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , do n't look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it 's never done something really good to eat .
instead , instead , the environmental model .
this is the one that 's in two billion years .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel ,
businesses which are not worlds for themselves , businesses , rather than <unk> , businesses , businesses , businesses are growing growing , rather than only hard , farmers , farmers , but experts are <unk> .
because they 're the ones who are the experts for flavor .
and if i 'm really honest , you 're a better chef than i ever .
you know , this is right , because if the future is good food , you will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to talk to you today , it 's one of the data that we consume , it 's bigger than the sum of your parts , and rather than thinking about how we use information to how we use information , and we see how so trends would be able to see it , and we see so trends that would be
this is what we see here is a typical state of old <unk> .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter to a particular cause of a cause , let 's accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that 's because in the <unk> , the people on the <unk> are , and they have over the <unk> .
we can go on a step out and then bring up the data and see that <unk> <unk> are <unk> , but not for each other .
now , if we 're going to go on and old and old , we see 40 years or younger , and we see the other people that accidents are actually concerned about the people who are concerned about people .
and who looks like that , is true of men .
so you can see that this looks of information and data in this kind of swimming in a living room .
and if we can do this to raw data , why do n't do it for content ?
what we 've got here are the <unk> who have been <unk> in the <unk> .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
you can like to test it to my talk to my day .
with <unk> , you can take a decade .
you can jump into a particular year .
you can jump straight to a particular copy .
now , if i look at this , i see the athlete that looks like that copy and the sports .
i 'm a lance <unk> fan , so i click on it , and i 'm going to show all the aid to me in which lance is going to be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> situation , i could think `` ok , what if i 'm going to look at all in the subject ? ''
so i 'm going to go back , and i 'm going to get the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you put this kind of information , <unk> , spread , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you 're not looking at or not just or <unk> .
you do something that 's a little bit different .
it 's something in between , and we 're changing the way that information can be used .
i want to make a little bit more on what a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is we took each individual <unk> , and they were <unk> on a little bit .
the <unk> contains a short , and a symbol for the area of it .
i 'm just showing the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
and immediately , we get a perception of the themes that are on wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose the topic of the subject .
now , after i 've been elected <unk> , i know that the <unk> who are <unk> at most of the year , in the year of the year .
this is really important , because it 's a realization that is not in a single <unk> .
this is just to see when you step back and look at all .
<unk> on a particular of these <unk> , then i can go into the subject of time , `` time , '' <unk> `` people '' in the year , '' and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of these are <unk> . some of science . some of the science , there 's less , from the economy , here 's my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , it 's a ted prize winner .
so we can jump up to jump , and looking at all the ted prize in the ted .
you see , we 're looking at the first time in the web as if it 's really a network , not just from side , but it 's much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else could be a little surprise .
i just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i do n't want to call a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can look at the <unk> , and we 're looking at this , and we 're going to look at these <unk> , and we 're going to bring these <unk> .
so i can go back a step back , and just jump to a specific <unk> .
so this is important , because you 're just looking at all of websites in this kind of <unk> and looking at the same way in the same way .
so i can actually zoom in in a particular <unk> way .
so here 's the state of the entire demonstration i 've been going to go over here .
and i can actually look at everything i 've been looking at now , again , again .
and , when i go back to it again , and i look at all of everything , i can look at the course of my path , maybe i 'd been looking for my <unk> , and here i was looking for <unk> , or what 's life ,
and from here , i can go into the side , and you 'll call it back .
it 's a metaphor that will be used again , and each time it 's bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the curse in the <unk> .
we talk about `` <unk> in information . ''
what if we could turn these situation and the internet on the head , so that 's what we 're going to go from a to a lot of things begin to have a lot of things to lots of things , and how to see patterns that would be stuck ?
if we can do this , then this is going to be <unk> , maybe a new source of information information .
and , instead of going to move in information , we can know it .
and when we know , maybe we can take the wisdom of it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> science fiction .
in my school , i went to school in school , every day , every day every day .
and my nose had always been in a book , a <unk> , which my thought of language in other worlds , and in <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
and the curiosity also came in , when i was not in school , by the forests , traveled and <unk> , and they were <unk> , frogs , frogs and <unk> and fashion and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of detail .
and my love to science fiction seemed to <unk> in my surroundings , because back in the late '60s , we went to the moon and trial the deep ocean .
jacques <unk> came into our living room with his seminal <unk> shows that we had animals and places and places , and a world have been filled with us .
so that 's probably a really good thing to do this .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games still video games with computer-generated manipulation , the whole images in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had all of the time we had to read when kids read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen in our head .
and my response to this is the <unk> and paint from aliens , alien worlds , robots , and all the things .
in math , i was caught in the teacher , as i hid in <unk> textbooks , <unk> .
the creativity had to get out of it .
and what happened was something interesting . what was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows , was the idea of a unknown world in our earth itself .
certainly , i would never get a quiet world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely .
but there was a world i could actually be in the earth , and it was as amazing and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic , as i had read this books .
so i decided to be 15 .
the only problem is that i lived in a little village in canada , a thousand kilometers from the next ocean .
but i did n't get it down .
i 'm betting my father , until he finally got a <unk> in <unk> , new york , finding right on the other side of the <unk> , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in the winter in the winter in the winter in <unk> , new york .
but the ocean , but the ocean is a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , the rate of <unk> , i spent about three hours under water , 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> ocean , the largest ocean is so rich , how we really ca n't imagine it .
the heart of nature have no barriers , very much in terms of our own , <unk> human imagination .
for the days , i feel the deepest awe of what i see on my <unk> .
and my love to the ocean is in the same psychotherapy as well , and the .
when i was a <unk> , it was the <unk> .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner line , telling stories , with my need to create images .
and as a kid , i had <unk> and so .
so , films the path , images and stories .
of course , the stories that i was <unk> from the <unk> , `` terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> , i could connecting my preference for the <unk> , and they 're connecting with the <unk> .
so these are the two passions .
something interesting happened in `` <unk> '' : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we took on <unk> animation ,
what 's came up was the first <unk> <unk> that ever been in a film .
so the movie did n't have money to have a money , right , he was just playing his <unk> , but i realized something amazing : the audience was on the world as <unk> the magic of the magic .
according to arthur , is the law are <unk> technology and magic .
so you saw something magic .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , this must be in the <unk> . ''
so we went in `` terminator two , '' my next film , has a lot .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal . the success of it was very much about how that effect come .
and it worked . again , we had created something that was created , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we did n't have a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was done , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , together with my good friend of <unk> who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called digital <unk> .
the idea of this company was it was to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and that 's what we did and give us a advantage of a advantage of advantage .
but in the middle of the '90s , we realized that we had in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we had started in the company , it was actually started <unk> .
i wrote this piece of `` avatar , '' that 's the bar of visual effects , and <unk> effects in very new heights of <unk> , expressive characters , and the <unk> should be <unk> .
but the bar <unk> , and the bar , and the people in my company told me that we 're not able to do that .
so i started that , and i made these other movie about the great ship , the goes on .
the <unk> <unk> , i sold the <unk> and julia and juliet , it became a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
but i would actually want to get the real <unk> of titanic .
that 's what i did .
this is the truth . the studio knew that .
i 've convinced them by saying , `` we watch the train . we call the real train .
we 're going to show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is incredibly important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> them to fund a expedition .
sound crazy . but this is back to it that your imagination can create a reality .
in fact , we created a reality of six months later in a russian time , in a russian <unk> months , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , and the real titanic titanic through a <unk> .
this was no movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really was really successful .
and the board had been enormous . we had to build cameras and <unk> and everything possible .
and i realized how much these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go in this capsule , then you 're going to come in this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is on saved when you do n't make it back .
and i thought , `` wow , this is as i would be in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was interested in studying the deep deep ocean .
anyway , from the part of curiosity and science , it was all . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could n't give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside the <unk> .
in some of the next thing , i 've seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes , things that had never seen before , and for the science of the science , when we watched it , i had no words in the time .
so that 's really cool , and i wanted to be more .
and then i met a little bit of an unusual decision .
and after the titanic , i told me , `` okay , i want to put my <unk> in hollywood to <unk> in the ice , and will be a while . ''
and then we started , we started the `` <unk> , '' and they study <unk> .
we went back to the olympic titanic .
we took little robots that we had built a <unk> .
our intent was , and to look at the inside of the ship .
nobody had ever had the inside of the <unk> . you had no tools . so we developed the technology .
now , i 'm now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is quite like this <unk> , and from where i know that the band had played there .
and i <unk> with a little bit of the ship .
i actually <unk> it , but my mind is within the <unk> .
it felt when i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> , which i 've ever experienced . because before i was a room , i 've always been able to get a corner of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , there was months of <unk>
and this kind of was a precise replica of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
she made this <unk> idea that you use such <unk> , and so the own minds in the vehicle , in these other form of existence .
it was really incredibly profound .
and perhaps a little bit of view of what might happen in some decades , if you have <unk> , to do something like , in all kinds of things that i can imagine .
so after this led , we started looking at what we had seen in the bottom , really appreciate , for example , this <unk> , where we saw these incredibly astonishing animals . these are kind of alien , but there 's the scale .
they live with <unk> .
they do n't exist in a sunlight because we 're doing this .
and so you see animals that are going to go to a 500 degree c , which is that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was very interested in the same time , which was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and to do nasa , and in the <unk> <unk> , and you 're going to go to russia , and they 're going to go to russia , from the mission of the <unk> of
this was fascinating .
but at the end , it was in the end of it , i was <unk> with us in the deep ocean .
and i took them with and <unk> access to the world , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people , people who were interested in the extreme situations . i took them to the vents for the vents so that they could look around , and so
we were doing <unk> , but we actually did science .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , then as a child , and the plays in reality .
in the course of these <unk> , i 've learned a lot .
i 've learned a lot of science , but i 'm now now think you have to think a director of a director , a leader , a leader .
but i do n't really understood a lot of leadership before i <unk> this led .
because of a particular point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what is that ? ''
these stinking films do n't bring us money .
we 're just playing the <unk> . it 's no turning back .
i mean , i think i think of the titanic , '' and `` avatar '' and it would have the <unk> on a towel on a towel .
i 've all these films , these <unk> , for a very little audience .
no fame , no honor , no credit , no money . what do you do ?
you 're doing it , and you 're going to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , you 're doing it . you 're making it in the <unk> , and because of the weird link , and because of the weird thing that arises , when a little group of people ,
because we 've done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked for years , and we 've got two to three months in the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning that you have a lot of each other , because you have a task to explain .
when you go to country , and you know , `` we had to do , and we had to do it , the <unk> , which is the whole technology , and the things that 's in seas , you know , the other people , you know , it 's like the other person , '' and that 's like the other people , the other people , you know , it 's like the other people , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other ones , you know , the other people , you know , the other ones , you know , the other ones , you know , the other ones , you know , the other ones , you know , the other ones , you know , the other ones , you know , the other things , you know , the other ones , you know ,
there 's a connection , a link to respect .
so when i was coming back to turn my next movie `` avatar , i tried to apply the same leadership policies , which is that you find his team and respect to the <unk> respect .
and it became really transformed .
so i stood up with a little kid on a little kid on a little kid on a little kid on a little bit of light , and we turned `` avatar with a new technology that did n't yet before .
it 's incredibly exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we became a long period of four years to a real family .
and that changed my way to make films .
there was people who thought we 'd have this <unk> , yes , in the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , which is the way that has changed .
so what can we have to conclude ?
what are we learned ?
i think the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the movements of your team is more important than the world 's <unk> .
and i get young filmmaker , who say , `` give me a advice how i could do something like this . ''
and i say , `` do n't give you one .
that 's another thing for you . do n't you do you for yourself , do n't do you yourself against themselves . but you take risks on you . ''
the nasa has a <unk> : `` fail is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study , failure has to be a alternative , because it guarantees it in a <unk> .
no big achievement , the innovation , has ever been looking at risk .
you have to be prepared to take these risks .
that 's the idea that i 'd like to give you with the path . fail . it 's not a alternative , fear , fear . thank you .
today i 'm talking about energy and climate .
and that 's surprising , perhaps , because my favorite features of the foundation are primarily about vaccines and seeds , to provide things that we have to make and provide the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , which is even more important than the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to be grown over many years . it 's too much better than to be too much better than that , and things are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be done as it can not be irrelevant .
it leads to <unk> . it leads to <unk> . it leads to <unk> .
so , it will be a climate effect for you .
it 's also important for them for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce one thing , the price of the cost is to <unk> energy in the most effective most effective .
well , the <unk> is about time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we 've got mad , <unk> materials , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , when we 're reducing the price -- let 's cut the price cut down -- we 're going to meet a new barrier , and that barrier is filled with co2 .
co2 warms , the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to the <unk> and put some very negative effects . effects on the weather , and maybe worse , that 's the surprising ecosystems , which is that the natural ecosystems can not be able to adapt to be able to adapt to be able to adapt and then <unk> .
now , the exact connection between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are , there are some <unk> , but not very many .
and there is certain of how bad these consequences are . but they 're very bad !
i have asked the <unk> times , `` do we have to get down to zero ?
is not half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we get near zero , is going to increase the temperature down .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than saying , we 've got a 3.5 meter of truck , who has to come under one three feet .
this is to go down to bottom , on zero .
well , we are <unk> a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it 's about five tons of tons of the planet .
and somehow we need to make changes that lower on zero .
it 's been <unk> .
only different economic changes are actually influenced by , and we need to have to be a reduction of disease , and to a reduction in zero .
and this equation has four factors . a little bit , they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- the co2 , which you want to get to zero , and that will depend on the cost of the human being in the service of the service , which is a <unk> of the service , which is
so let 's look at each amount of probability and think about how we get it on zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let 's go through .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and there 's nine billion to go to nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , we could lower 10 percent to 15 percent , but we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that 's all the food that we eat , clothing , <unk> , heating .
these are very good things , and <unk> means , these services are almost accessible to the planet .
it 's great that this number goes .
in the rich world , in the upper world , we could be able to make <unk> and less use , but on average , this number is going to be going to double each year and double the number of
so here we see a very basic service . there 's the same light , so you can read the homework .
and these students did n't have it , so they go out , and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally good news .
we have something that does n't go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , by other ways , from new ways in the <unk> , there are a lot of services to develop a range of production to grow 90 percent .
in other <unk> , like the manufacturing process of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , it 's very much larger .
if we 're optimistic , if we 're optimistic , maybe a factor of three or maybe even have a factor .
but the first three factors , we 're now in 26 billion tons of <unk> 13 billion tons , and it 's not just not out .
so let 's look at the fourth factor , and this is going to be a <unk> -- this is the amount of co2 that will be <unk> .
it turns out to be the question , if you can get to zero .
when you burn coal , no .
when you burn natural gas , no .
nearly every <unk> for electricity today today , except the renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i do the term , `` wonders , i do n't have the impossible .
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to a lot of these wonders .
typically there is no <unk> , you need a miracle to a particular date .
typically , you 're just going to go back and some of them , not .
but in this case , we have to give up , and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered how can i really <unk> ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration , which is the idea of people on ?
i was reminded me at last year , when i brought the <unk> , and somehow the people liked it .
the idea became really tangible , you know , you know that there are people who are living with mosquitos .
for energy , this is one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> contribution to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you have told me that you ca n't bite you . actually , you 're not going to leave the glass .
well , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they do n't all get much .
we need to have the solutions , either one or several <unk> and incredible <unk> , and even though there are many directions , where people are looking for five , i 'm really just five ,
i have declined , <unk> , merger and biofuels .
and you might afford a moderate contribution , and if you expect better than i expect , it 's great , but my boss here is that we have to give all of these five work , and we ca n't give up of them because they 're going to give us a significant problems .
let 's first look at the burn fossil fuels , the burning of the coal or natural gas or natural gas .
what you have to do is , maybe it 's easy , but it 's not . you have to get all of the co2 , which is going to go out of the <unk> , and then there 's a pressure , and then there 's somewhere there is there .
there 's some <unk> , which is the <unk> of a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it 's going to get 100 percent of the co2 , is a big challenge , but the largest problem here is the <unk> .
who is going to make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally has a lot of billion times bigger than any kind of junk that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a hard <unk> .
next one : <unk> .
and there 's also three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question is to say that you can really feel wrong , despite the human genome that 's not used for weapons .
and what do you do with it ?
because even though he 's not very large , there 's a lot of consider .
so three difficult problems that might be soluble , and that 's why you should work .
the last three of five <unk> i 've summarized .
it 's renewables as they often be called <unk> .
and also , even -- although it 's great is that they do n't need a fuel -- you have some <unk> .
one is the <unk> that these technologies produce dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , a thousand place as a normal power .
and then these vents are <unk> .
the sun seems to be the whole day , they 're not going to be every day , and they 're not even the wind .
that 's why you have to depend on these vents , you have to have a way to get the energy in times when they 're not available .
so there 's big <unk> . there 's challenges in the transmission . when we say , if we say , is that the power of the country is , you do n't need to have the technology that you have to deal with the risk of where you get from the ground .
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i 've all kinds of batteries , which are made , the computer , computer , cell phone , <unk> , which is , and i found out of the electronic energy , and i found out that all the batteries we 're going to produce each other , less than you could produce batteries , less than 10 minutes ,
so we need a big breakthrough , something that 's going to be 100 better than the marketers of time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
what happens when you 're trying to do this <unk> vents about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest .
if you want to have 100 percent of it , you need a incredible <unk> .
now , where do we go , what is the right thing ?
one `` manhattan project ? how do we go to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of firms , hundreds of companies .
in each of these five areas we need 100 people .
in many , you 'll say , they 're crazy ! that 's good .
i think here in the ted group , there 's a lot of , who are already engaged there .
bill 's big firms , which has a called a called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies making the great things and have interesting opportunities , and i 'm trying to support that .
nathan <unk> and i finance a company , who might be <unk> to the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; willpower , <unk> .
the development has been in this industry for some time , so it 's no great surprise that some good concepts around .
the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , which is a percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn 99 percent , the <unk> .
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it for a long time , but you could n't make a reasonable simulate whether it would work , but it 's modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , yes , yes , yes , yes , it looks like it looks like it .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it 's very much better .
in fact , you burn the junk , and you can even use the waste of these reactors as a <unk> .
instead of <unk> the head , you burn it . a great thing .
it 's <unk> <unk> , a little bit like a candle .
you see that there 's a kind of <unk> , often , as `` <unk> wave . ''
the problem is really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste of 99 percent . you 've got the part of this today , so it 's called <unk> <unk> .
it 's the u.s. government for hundreds of years .
and when you 're cheap and simple , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's a example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let 's think about how we should measure our success .
how should our statement look like ?
well , let 's go to the target we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many of a 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it 's really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be generated in poor countries , and they 're still going to be a farming agriculture , hopefully <unk> and cement .
so to reach these 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other note says if we use the <unk> technology , whether it 's in all developed countries , and we 're on the path to get them .
this is great important .
this is going to be a shift projection .
when we go back to the 2020 ?
it should be the two elements .
we should be using the <unk> use to get resources to the way . the less we <unk> , the lower is <unk> and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the note that we 're doing is that we do n't have companies that do n't completely completely <unk> to the great <unk> , only less , or even something less important , which is less important to the <unk> of the innovation .
these are the breakthroughs we have to pursue with <unk> and we can measure that , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a lot of great books in this topic .
the al gore called the choice and david <unk> , `` <unk> energy <unk> the <unk> air . ''
they 're really going to go through and create a frame , where this is going to be discussing , because we need to support for all sides .
there 's a good thing to get together .
that 's a wish .
a very <unk> wish we invent this technology .
if you 're just a desire for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a <unk> , and the love i could choose , or i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , and that 's the desire .
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get these wish , the digging are going to dig between the long term and a range of people , between the united states between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and all of these lives are very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
for what ?
we need to use more <unk> .
when countries are doing in places like <unk> , they do n't just talk about co2 .
you should talk to these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous tiny money that are going to be spent for this innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 control , <unk> <unk> trade , and we have an <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to go through <unk> and whole , and also the things that are going to be done by the government .
it 's a important wish , but i think we can meet him .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better to understand something -- first , you can give us a idea of scale of the investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , which is to get a great scientist , which we 've done , and even if we have tested some 10 million . and even if we 've tested our materials in a russian reactor , it 's just
the difficult step is the building of the first <unk> , another billion , which is going to build the ground .
when the first thing is , when he 's going to be like this , everything is quite clear , because the economy that is so different as we know .
so to understand the right thing , which means that it 's deep at the ground , a vertical <unk> <unk> , this used to <unk> it , and then the process starts to the bottom ?
bg : exactly . now , you know , you have . now you have to be new into the reactor , so there 's a lot of people and many controls , and many controls , that 's the thing you can go wrong , and this thing you 're going to make it 's wrong , and there 's no <unk> .
but if you have a low-cost fuel , you can use it in 60 years -- think of a pillar -- you bury them , without all the <unk> .
and it 's there and <unk> 60 years , and then it 's done .
a <unk> , which is a solution to the waste .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the waste is : you can sit there -- there 's a lot of waste with this method -- and then you take it in the next thing and burn it down .
and we start using the garbage , which is already there , which is in these <unk> or <unk> of the reactors . that 's our <unk> .
so that 's what these reactors was a problem , which is what we put in our fill and that 's the <unk> dramatically .
but while they talked about these world talking about these opportunities .
where is the biggest interest , what really do ?
bg : so now we have a place , and there 's a lot of more interesting <unk> for everything in the name . there 's big interest in russia , india , india , china , china , and i 've met the minister of the energy , and talked about how to fit
i 'm optimistic . you know , you know , the french and japanese did something in the direction .
this is a flavor of a thing that has been done .
this is an important step ahead , but it 's like a faster , and some countries have this built built , so everyone who has been done a little bit , a <unk> thing to our first .
in your perception , <unk> and probability really are going to call your life ?
bg : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent 20 years .
this is the <unk> that has demonstrated us the <unk> <unk> that we need to do .
and you know , you know , <unk> , if everything is doing good , and that 's a big wish that could be easy .
and fortunately , there 's dozens of firms today , and we need hundreds of these things that work in the way that they work to work for the pilot , for profit .
and it would be the best if there are several , because you could use a mixture of it .
anyway , we need a solution .
are the great possible breakthroughs , is that the largest thing you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it would be done without the <unk> , but the power is so much more important .
there are other innovative companies .
you know , we do n't know your work , not so good like this , but there 's the <unk> technique that 's another approach .
there 's a texture <unk> , which seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe that 's going to tell us this .
and so , there 's different , but the nice thing is that a <unk> times a million times as much energy , and that 's why , if you can deal with the radiation , the footprint and the cost , the footprint and the cost , and the cost of the country , the potential and the cost , and then the cost of the country , the potential and the cost , and the cost of the country , and the cost of the country , and the cost of the country , and other things ,
if that does n't work what ?
have we have to be able to be square to try to make the <unk> stable stable ?
bg : if you get in this situation , it 's like a lot of heart attack , and you know , what do you do ?
there 's a <unk> <unk> , which is called <unk> with different techniques to delay itself , so we 've got 20 or 30 years to be taken us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we do n't need that .
some people say , you do n't want to do n't work on insurance 's insurance , because you might be lazy because you 're going to be lazy , because you 're going to continue to save the <unk> .
i do n't know if you 're smart , if you get to the importance of this problem , but there 's a discourse in <unk> of whether you ought to have the things that we need to get faster , or this innovation we expect .
<unk> : did you have a or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the scientific arguments are very little .
tell you that there are negative implications to do with clouds ?
there 's very , very few things that you can tell at all , which is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is so similar to aids .
you do the mistake now , and you pay very much later .
and so the idea of all , now , if you all have all kinds of <unk> problems , in something that has just later , which is that the investment is not so obvious , and in fact , the ipcc report report on the worst possible world , and say , okay , okay , okay , okay .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry .
but my dream here is , if you do it , and at the same time , the global ocean is going to say , `` okay , i 'm not interested in the atmosphere , i 'm not interested in it , i wish it 's not to accept that , but i 'm going to accept it because it 's probably cheaper than the previous method . ''
and that would be the answer to the <unk> point that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals , the other goals of malaria , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that 's going to continue to invest in terms of resources that are better things that we can do better .
bg : well , the real spending for research -- say , the u.s. spending have to spend 10 billion per year than you do today -- this is not so dramatic .
including other things not suffer .
and then you get too large <unk> , and here 's reasonable people , if you 've got something that is not economic , and it 's trying to finance this . for me .
it 's because you 're very quickly , and funded the learning curve , and i think we should be more things that have more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get a very high school teacher , you can keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here could be five times so much for our energy without changing his lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even with <unk> .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research in the research ? ''
he 's still still , because of his earlier stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very low group , and that 's why it 's now the <unk> .
and this is a line that i think is appropriate .
the research , it 's just crazy as a <unk> .
bill , i think i 'm telling all of all people , if i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , there 's a <unk> , peter <unk> called `` the <unk> . ''
the idea is quite simple . <unk> need to have the biggest <unk> structure of structure with 20 <unk> , ca n't get <unk> tape and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , even though it 's really easy , it 's actually really hard to work on , because it 's working together very quickly .
and so i thought that this is a interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i 've done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there 's something to the point of what a little bit of collaboration is to share with you , and i want to share some of them .
now , usually the most people are looking at the <unk> themselves .
you talk about how it 's looking at how it 's going to be , <unk> power .
then they invest in planning and organization , and they came out and put <unk> .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> of the <unk> structures .
and finally , just before you do n't have time more , somebody takes the marshmallow , and they put it gently on the top , and `` <unk> ! ''
but then , what happens is , is that the `` <unk> '' is going to be `` <unk> '' because the weight of the <unk> is that the whole thing is and <unk> .
there 's a number of people who have a lot more than a lot of <unk> , and under the worst are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused and they 're really confused and producing really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also a team of <unk> <unk> , and under the best , there are <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
and that 's quite astonishing .
as peter , peter told them not only have the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how does this come ? why ? what is that ?
and peter 's telling : no one of the kids do n't have time to be time in the <unk> <unk> .
they do n't invest in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that is that <unk> were engaged , to find a real plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you do n't have time more and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> are different is that they start building the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , and that 's the <unk> on the top of the top , so that the possibility has <unk> prototypes to repair it .
now , these kinds of collaboration is as a core of a <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids get <unk> and what does n't work .
this is the performance of working with prototypes , but we see how different teams operate .
the average for most of the average is about <unk> , <unk> , provide half of the lawyers , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and geometric geometric patterns to build the key to stable structures .
ceos are about average . but there 's interesting .
you get a copyright <unk> on the team , you 'll be significant better .
it 's unbelievable . you see and see this team will win . ''
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they lead the process , you understand him .
and this team that regulates their bodies and on the work is the performance of the team of the team .
so , to 3d skills and <unk> and the combination to success .
when you have 10 teams who have a typical system , you get about six , the robust structures .
now i tried a little thing .
i thought we could get the <unk> .
so i got a <unk> $ <unk> for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if you did n't have a <unk> high school , he would have worn home .
so is it not interesting that high levels have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
now , what do you think ?
now , you understand the advantage of the <unk> .
so , from the same , bad team of a under the best .
it 's powered the highest construction in the least of time .
so , there 's <unk> lessons for us , the nature of <unk> and success .
and you might like , why would anyone actually invest a <unk> ?
the reason is , i 'm <unk> digital tools and processes to help together teams , cars , video games , `` <unk> <unk> . ''
and what the <unk> is doing is , they helps to identify your hidden assumptions .
because open , each project has its own marshmallow .
so the challenge is to create a common experience , a common language , or a common language , and <unk> to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience that simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can be <unk> .
it 's a blog where you see how you build the <unk> .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples from all world , how people are hawking and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think the construction is actually a <unk> sports .
it 's going to be all the senses that we 're doing all of our senses on the task , and we 're using our thinking , how to our senses , in the challenge , to us .
and sometimes a little prototype of these experience is everything it takes us from a `` <unk> '' moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so , we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time machine .
and everyone has to be in this room .
and you can go in the past , you can go into the future ; you ca n't stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i 'd like my friends in last time , and they wanted to go in the past .
i do n't know . they wanted back to the time before , before , or twitter , or `` america 's <unk> . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that it 's kind of sort of <unk> to wishful thinking .
and that 's what i do .
i 'm not part of this group , i need to say .
i do n't want to be in the past , and i do n't , because i am a study .
it 's because it 's not going to go back on this planet .
so i want to go in this machine , and i want to walk in the future .
this is the most successful time that there was on this planet , no matter what 's scale you do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , opportunities .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> had died when they were 60 .
my grandparents <unk> these numbers on 70 .
my parents are the 80 in turkey .
so there should be better at a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not even people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a kid who is born in new delhi can not expect to live so long as the richest man on the world .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox , smallpox have killed billions of the planet .
you 've got the demographics of the earth in a way , how it does n't have war .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we 've got them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases , millions of us are faced with a generation of us .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that 's ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people who are success of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look , whether it works if it does n't do it , one of the great risk of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , this is all good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they 've been talking about it .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world are hungry every day .
this number is going to go , and it goes very quickly , and that 's an <unk> .
and not just that , we have used our imagination to celebrate this world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , oil , gas , and it 's soon , and it 's soon , and if we do n't get out of this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that you live in .
i think we can provide these world with energy , and it 's the power of power that they did not destroyed .
i think that really , and no , that 's not a wishful wishful wishful thinking .
but this is me telling me at night -- one of the things that hold me at night . we 've never been able to have a scientific progress that has never needed to be as well as well .
and we 've never been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and we 're in the verge of astonishing , amazing events on many areas , and yet , i really think , 300 years ago , we have to go back to the way we have progress in the way we have progress in the way that we have , in which we have progress in these things , we have
people <unk> themselves in their faith , and that 's so profound that you ca n't release them .
it 's not even the truth of it .
and you hear , everyone has a right on his opinion , even a right on its opinion .
but you know what you do n't have right ?
you do n't have right on your own facts . <unk> , you do n't .
and i needed a while to find that .
about a decade ago , i wrote a article about vaccination for `` the new yorker , '' a little article .
and i was amazed at the end of the resistance to the resistance of the resistance to what the most effective process of humanity is in history of humanity .
i did n't know what i should do , so i did just do what i 'm going to do , i wrote a article and ran on .
and soon , soon i wrote a article about <unk> changed .
same thing is , just bigger .
people were crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about it , and i could n't understand why people thought that would be `` <unk> , '' why they believed that molecules in a particular rather than a random kind of <unk> in nature .
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i 've got the article on it .
i mean , i am journalist .
we call it , we 're eating food that 's okay .
but this article made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it out .
and that 's because that <unk> , which were me crazy at all .
these were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so much .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we have a point where we do n't have the same relationship to progress in the progress .
we talk about <unk> .
we talk ironic , with little <unk> that is , `` progress . ''
okay , there 's reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of science , and there 's no reason why it should n't be so .
you can call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weapons , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they were still right . so they were skeptical .
ask you ask , ask the evidence , require evidence .
do n't have a given thing .
but now there 's the evidence , if you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we 're not good at it .
and i can say that in the reason that we 're going to live in a epidemic of fear of fear , and hopefully it never never seen again .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that was <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
a lot of studies were done to see whether it was true .
a lot of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't power because we believe in excitement , we believe what we see to see what 's going to make us really feel .
we do n't believe a bunch of documents from a <unk> , who is data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was <unk> .
because of the fact that the fact , the u.s. is one of the only country on the world where the neurological increase in the world .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand this . i do .
because someone 's shoes here ?
has a single one in the audience ever see someone in the audience ?
is n't really often .
happening is happening in this country , but 160,000 times in the world .
these are many deaths from <unk> , 20 pounds .
but because that 's not happening here , we can have a <unk> , and people like <unk> <unk> are going to come from <unk> and <unk> from <unk> and <unk> king live .
and you can do it because it 's cause and correlation .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be in the same , but almost never ever be the same .
and that 's something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle , there 's not so much .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he 's just a <unk> .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 kids per year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
now , this is good , besides that paul <unk> and says , and say how hard you are , and that people would just stop in the <unk> .
and that 's actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public language , he ca n't talk without armed <unk> .
he gets to go home , because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul did a <unk> .
i do n't need that , but it 's a lot of <unk> .
you get it up , you get back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and that 's going on .
we 've got in this country now .
and that 's going to be worse , and pretty soon , children are going to die again , because this is just one question of numbers .
and they 're not just dying .
what about wet ? do we do this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine wrote a few weeks ago , and she says i 'm a little bit too <unk> .
nobody said that before .
she would not be her kid against <unk> .
<unk> .
why ? because we do n't have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country .
now , i do n't know , i do n't know somebody else in lagos in lagos in lagos , and it 's just going to los angeles , in the moment .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and it 's going to be long beach , and it 's going to come from this <unk> <unk> .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a <unk> disease , and we do n't know that , because the world works now .
this is the planet that we live . they do n't as if it 's not .
we love it to lie . we love this .
have you all taken your vitamins ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , you 're going to be able to get you on a suitcase .
i know that they did this because half of americans do that every day .
you take the stuff , and you take a alternative cure , and it does n't make any difference , how often we find that they 're useless .
the data is all the time .
they <unk> their urine . more they never never do .
this is okay , you want to do 70 billion dollars for dark urine .
i completely agree .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> business .
we hate a strong government . we do n't trust the system .
and that 's not us . our health system is <unk> .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely cool and <unk> ourselves to us , who can afford it .
so we 're going to run away , and where do we go ?
we 're in the poor <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i 've got all kinds of little artifacts here .
no one -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because i do n't even know what that 's , but we give billions of dollars for it , it 's <unk> .
and you know what ? if i say that , and i would tell people who you want to say , `` what cares ? let me do what they want .
so you feel good . ''
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
because it does n't care whether it 's the minister of the minister is that says , `` hmm , i 'm going to avoid the evidence of my experts in mammography , '' or some <unk> , who wants to treat his patients .
when you get out on this path where and magic and magic to replace science and science , you get to a place where they do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 400,000 his people to be because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> drugs are much more efficient than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can slow down .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than each other disease .
do n't tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have . they have .
now , the <unk> epidemic in which we 're right now is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . you have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , each branch , every <unk> , has changed from people .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden .
there was no <unk> .
there was no first time . we 've done it .
we 've done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them has work and not .
we were rid of what did n't work .
now , we can do it , and of course , there 's risk . but we can do something like that , and we can do something like that , and this stuff can help millions of people to prolong millions of people .
do n't you want to do that ?
i have to say that i do n't understand that .
we reject <unk> food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm listening is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we do n't want a huge fields with a thing that is wrong .
we do n't want to <unk> companies .
we do n't want that companies have seeds .
and you know what my answer is ?
yeah , you have right . fix it .
it 's true , we have a huge problem , but that 's not science .
it 's nothing to do with science .
it 's fairly , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it 's actually work and not , but the idea that we should n't allow science to do their work , because we have fear is a real end of people , and she 's got millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to grow 70 percent more food than currently .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
marcus : a <unk> .
you need this , and we do n't give them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that has half a billion people .
it 's like a potato .
it 's just a handful of calories . it 's <unk> .
it has no nutrients , it does n't have protein , and scientists just build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food and would n't be blind .
you would n't starve , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it would n't be <unk> <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask us , why do we fight this ?
because we do n't want to <unk> genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , to hormones , our <unk> , better food , better food ,
it 's not about rice <unk> , it 's about getting people at the lives , and it 's going to get the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do that , if we do so far as far , we think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , not guilty , the way we want to be a remote way .
there is no other description of what 's happening here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not worthy , and we have to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , `` do you want to go in this ridiculous time , and in the future ? ''
everyone 's . i want to be a case .
in the moment , they 're in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this time period of everything we want .
we can <unk> them , where we 're going to <unk> them , and we 're going to move them to where we want .
we have to have this conversation , and we need to think , but if we 're going to go into the time period , and we 'll be happy in the future , we 're happy to have it .
i know that we can have it , and as far is what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i 've been interested in the <unk> , and it might seem to be strange , that 's because it 's true to it , it 's because it 's like me as a deception that 's going to be a deception , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in it ,
in other words , <unk> have shown in some studies in some studies , which is a measurable effect , the <unk> , which is because the person thinks of what 's going to be , a <unk> or a kind of -- for example , is that the patient believes in the body , which is
a deception is going to be a real thing , because someone looks like .
so we can also understand each other , i want to understand a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i 'll show you how he works . this is a trick who has at least for the 1950s .
i 've got it with the <unk> <unk> magic of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for them and then explain .
and then i 'll explain why i explain .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand they can study .
i 'm going to be the knife just in my hand .
i <unk> my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , or from him , i 'll just get my wrist on this wrist here .
in this way , you can see that there 's no time in time , as long , there 's a little bit of thing , nothing can come up or get out there .
and the goal is quite simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is fine , it 's going to be <unk> through my naked physical <unk> .
in fact , it 's actually quite a place that i can shake it without being <unk> .
nothing goes in my sleeve or there 's no <unk> , and you can study everything .
yay !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot of deception , when you look at a deception , even though it 's a very simple trick .
probably many of you here are there in the room of this trick .
so , he works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i 'm going to <unk> my wrist , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , and it 's a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist , is that there 's the actual secret of illusion .
and in the moment , where i 'm going to <unk> my hand , so you see it from the back , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position where he 's <unk> .
amazing trick ?
there 's somebody who had no childhood .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i got myself , the fingers changes its position .
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't see here , there 's just three fingers : because the minds and the way that 's the minds and the way it 's data , it 's not one , one , one , two , you know , you know , it 's not one , you know , you know , it 's not one , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's
but that 's what it 's now . and then , i open my hand .
of course it 's going to get there , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , which is now there .
and if i 'm going to leave my hand , the same thing happens to me , by <unk> , through this movement is hidden that the fingers left .
i take these hand away . and here 's the knife .
this trick , you can show your friends and the neighbors . thank you .
now , what about the <unk> ?
a year ago , or so i read a study that has really struck me .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so this was an amazing thing .
so what it turns out , it turns out , when you provide a <unk> in a white pill in a white pill in a white pill , which is just a round , white pill , which has a particular measurable effect .
but if you get the shape , you know , in a smaller pill , for example , in a smaller pill , and these blue <unk> and a letters that 's actually more effectively .
and that , even though no <unk> -- it 's just <unk> .
but one white pill is not so good as a blue pill .
what ? i was really mad .
but it turns out that it 's not all .
when you take a <unk> , there are more effective than pills .
a colored capsule , which is yellow and on the other red is better than one white capsule .
it 's also a role .
one pill a day , not so much as three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact statistics . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is , is , ...
... that 's a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab the needle .
right ? one syringe with a <unk> -- a <unk> of a <unk> substance , which you 're going to be a patient .
this is a very strong image in your head . that 's much stronger than one white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'll show you , i 'll show you another thing when we have a <unk> .
so , the fact is that the white pill does n't seem so good like the blue pill , which is not as good as a capsule that do n't really work like the needle .
and nothing really has a really <unk> quality . it 's just our belief that has been the stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i suppose that 's obviously a deception , and it 's going to be a real way .
we know from the study that you have to do to the needle when it is to go .
this is a 18 inches long . she 's very , very , very , very , very <unk> . and i 'll first put it a little bit very low .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> <unk> .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
so i 'm going to stick these needle in my skin , and they run through it until you get back to the other side .
if you 're bad , if you fall easy in <unk> -- i 've got a couple of friends in the hotel room , and some people who did n't know , and it 's a woman has almost <unk> .
so , i 'm going to show you , if you get bad , you look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , what , i 'm going to do the first <unk> part of this .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also see , but you can also want to see <unk> .
so , it 's like , right here , where my meat starts to look at the lower part of my <unk> .
do i 'm really happy . does it crazy ?
and now , just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now , we 're in the same situation we had in the <unk> .
it 's about .
but now you ca n't count my finger , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , right ?
i know what the people think if you see this .
you say , `` okay , this is n't so stupid and <unk> themselves , just to entertain us a few minutes long . ''
well , i 'm going to show you .
how this looks like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people say , `` okay . i do n't see that . ''
the people in the <unk> are running now .
let me show you about it .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can <unk> it .
i 'm sorry . if you get bad , look at the way .
the back of the back or the day later , later , you see later , will say , `` well , yeah , it 's quite impressive , but if it 's real , you know , there 's a hole and there , if it would be real , ''
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yes , there 's it .
now , usually i would have the needle and it would be the needle .
i would show my arm and showing you that there is no wounds .
but i think in this context here , and with the intention of a deception , i 'm going to make a real thing in a deception , i 'm going to get the needle in the stage .
we 're going to face a couple of time .
i hope you 're looking at it . thank you .
everyone talks about the happiness .
i have a couple of people who have the number of books in the book , which has been published in the last five years , and they gave over 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there 's a big wave of interest in happiness .
there 's a lot of <unk> .
everyone wants to make people happier .
but despite all of these tides of the world , there are several cognitive quality , which are going to be impossible to think of happiness .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive fall .
this applies to <unk> , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so disturbing how everyone else is like everyone .
the first of these traps is to fall a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word `` good word is not a useful word , because we use it in a lot of different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning , which we could have to limit on the limit , but in the big and whole , this is something that we 're going to give up , and we 're going to give up the complicated view of what 's going on .
the second trap is , and memory is , and memory is essentially , essentially , is between being happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two different concepts , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that 's the <unk> of the fact that we ca n't think about a situation that affects well-being , without due to warp .
i mean , that 's a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to begin with a example of someone who had a <unk> , which is a story , and [ unclear ] he said he was a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and in the end of the
and then he added a little bit , really emotional , the whole experience .
but that did n't .
what it had transformed is the memory of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
she did n't <unk> , because he was the memory with <unk> ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was getting everything to keep it .
what we really says , is that we could think about other people in the senses of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> self who lives in the present and the present way to experience the past again , but basically the present .
it 's the <unk> self , which is the doctor 's doctor , you know , if the doctor asks , `` do it hurts if i 'm going to <unk> it ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that , the <unk> and the story of our lives , and it 's the doctor in the doctor , `` how did you feel the question , ''
or `` what was your journey to albania ? '' or so similar .
these are two very different units , which is the <unk> itself , and the <unk> themselves , and the two of them are part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we do n't just tell stories when we 're telling us stories .
our memory tells us the stories , which is what we 're looking at from our experience is a story .
and let 's start with a example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who are <unk> .
i 'm not going to go into the details . it 's not more painful , but it was painful as these trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds to report .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask , `` who 's got more organized ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b has been <unk> . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that had a patient , and more .
but now there is another question , `` how very these patients have been <unk> ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient 's a lot of a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how she ends .
and no of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clearly .
but one of them is quite worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse is the , where the pain was really on his peak . it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we have asked these guys after their <unk> , and too much later , `` how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a than b to b .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from view of the <unk> self , it clearly had a <unk> time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we 've done clinical trials , and it 's done , and it 's done , and it 's done , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , you could actually be able to <unk> the <unk> of the patient , just <unk> the hose without <unk>
this is that the patient 's suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you have a couple of minutes , you did n't have a lot of the patient 's own a bad self , and you did n't have a lot of the patient to be a lot more better , because you 've given the patient a better story about his experience .
what is a story ?
and that 's true of the stories that the memory makes us give us and it 's true for the stories that we invent .
what a story is , a story are <unk> , great moments and ends .
end is very , very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the <unk> self live .
it 's a day of the <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to this moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most of our days of our life -- and i 've done this -- you know , the psychological present in the world , you know , you know , about 600 million of them .
most of you are completely ignored from the <unk> itself .
and yet , you get some of the impression that what happens in this moments of the <unk> life .
it 's limited resource we use in this world .
and as we use it , but that 's not the story that makes the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> themselves and the <unk> themselves , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the power of time .
from the course of the <unk> self , when you have a vacation , and the second week , the first week , the first week , the first time , the <unk> vacation is going to double twice as well nameless vacation .
that does n't work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> themselves , a <unk> vacation is barely more likely to provide better than the <unk> vacation because there 's no new memories we 're going to <unk> .
they did n't change the story .
and in this way , it 's the critical variable that 's a massive level of different danger of a <unk> themselves . time it has very little impact on this story .
now , the <unk> themselves are more than remember and tell stories .
it 's actually one of the one that makes the decisions , because if you have a patient who had two <unk> in two different surgeons , and you decides that the <unk> who has the memory that 's less bad , and that 's the surgeon that 's been selected .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this election .
in fact , we do n't choose between <unk> . we choose between the memory of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't normally think of our future .
we think about our future , memory .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> themselves , and you can think of the <unk> themselves as a , which is the most part of the <unk> in terms of experience that 's not going to need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we 're going to get vacation a lot of the case , that 's where we 're going to get mentally relative to the services of the <unk> .
and that 's a little bit difficult , i think .
i mean , how very <unk> we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of <unk> self .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation , which we 've done a few years ago in antarctica , which was probably the best vacation i 've ever had , and i think in the relationship , i think about how often i think about other <unk> .
and i probably had a memory of these <unk> journey , i would say about 25,000 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i 've ever opened the folder my folder with 600 images , i spent another lesson .
well , these are three weeks , and that 's a half a half a year .
there 's the disagreement .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , you know , how little appetite i 've got to do , but even , if you do it a real question , why do n't we give you to the weight of the weight that we give
so i want to think you want to think about a thought of thought .
imagine her next vacation , you know that at the end of the <unk> , the end of all images , and they get a <unk> drug , so they 're not remember .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose another inch , there 's a conflict between your two ways of self , and you have to think about how conflict do , and that 's really obvious , because if you think of the sense of time , you know , and if you think of the senses of memory , you could get a different answer .
why we choose the <unk> , which we have to choose is a problem with a choice between the two ways of self .
now , the two ways of self would take two terms of happiness .
in fact , there are two concepts of the happiness we can use , one per face .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> yourself ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> themselves ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and , by the way , we 're now able to get a pretty good idea from the happiness of the <unk> self .
if you ask for the happiness of the <unk> , it 's a very different thing .
that 's not how happy a person alive .
it 's how happy or <unk> the person is , when these person is thinking about her life .
very different concept .
everyone who do n't be different to these terms of happiness , and i belong to a lot of researchers about well-being that have been a lot of happiness in the right .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self , and the happiness of the <unk> self has been discovered in the last few years , and now you 're going to get to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , where more than a half million people have been asked about a million people who are thinking about her life and over their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started talking about the happiness of the two ways of self .
and the main reasons that we have , i think , is that they 're really different .
you can know how to be happy with his life , and teach them not much about how happy he live and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation .
what that means is that if you would meet someone , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know ?
well , you would have something about his scale , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone 's life has his life than eight <unk> , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his <unk> .
so correlation is tiny .
we know something about what happiness is determines .
we know that money is very important , is very important .
we know that happiness is going to be satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there 's other delight , but that 's a dominant .
so if you 're going to maximize the two kinds of the self , you 're going to do very different things .
and the conclusion from what i 've said is that we do n't want to give us a happiness in the well-being of well-being .
it 's a completely different word .
well , very soon , a different reason that we ca n't realize about happiness is that we do n't look at the same things , if we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , you 're not the correct answer .
if you think about this question , you know that people have to be happier in california , if you , let 's live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it 's not even important for the <unk> themselves , decides that are happy .
but , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can go to the end of california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track of what happens to people who are moving to california to become happier .
well , you 're not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you 're going to think you are happier , because if you 're going to think about it , you 're thinking about how many of the weather is in ohio , and they 're going to get the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we first got a few weeks ago , you know , you 've got a very interesting outcome that came from this <unk> survey .
is that something that you can give us because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : safe .
i think i think the most interesting results that we 've found in the <unk> survey is a number that we had absolutely not to find out .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the <unk> itself .
when we looked at how emotions with the income .
and it turns out that under 60,000 dollars in the year , americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 20,000 , but it 's a big representative sample of 400 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they 'll be more happy , the poorer , you 're going to be .
and we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've seen so flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money does n't give you a <unk> , but that lack of money , is certainly not in money , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you do is , the <unk> is it .
it 's not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american development , it 's about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this kind of scientific idea , i mean , everything seems to the head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country does not take a kind of an idea how much of it would be based on policy ?
dk : you know , i think there is a <unk> of the role of environmental policy .
the <unk> is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , they 're going to happen in other countries .
people have to realize that they should be lucky , if you think about policy .
it 's going to be a while , and the people are going to explore whether you want to explore <unk> or whether you want to study <unk> , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
how to happiness can be very different from how you think , and whether you think about it , or whether you think about the <unk> yourself , or whether you think of the <unk> themselves .
it 's going to affect policy , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you 're <unk> to measure the population of the population .
that 's going to be , i think , a few decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this topic is , or should not be the most exciting political debate for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i make video games .
i think now , i think about 10 years now , and my goal is for the next decade , it 's just as easy to save the world in the reality , to save the world .
i have a plan for that . i want to persuade more people , including all of all , more time with play more and <unk> games .
currently , we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of them might think , `` this is a whole bunch of time for games . ''
maybe too much time , if you think about how many problems we need to solve the real world in the real world .
in fact , my research in the center for the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive this next century on this planet , we need to increase the time in change .
i 've got to evaluate the time of the age of 21 billion hours a week .
now this looks at something that might first be a little bit more precise , so i repeat it , so , if we can do it : if we 're going to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts and obesity , for the next week , for the next week .
no , i 'm really serious .
why ? this picture is quite exactly what i believe that games are so important for the human species in the future .
this is a picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to make the feelings of play . so he has a camera on the players .
this is one of the classical expression of play .
if you 're not a player , you might not do some of the <unk> in this picture .
you 're probably looking at this sense of urgency , something fear , but also , very much concentration , it 's a little bit of hard to solve a real hard problem .
when you 're playing , you see some <unk> here , which are <unk> on top of the <unk> and the mouths are a sign of optimism . the eyebrow the eyebrow .
this is a player who is on the edge of a called <unk> .
oh , you know this . ok , ok , so we have some player here .
a <unk> victory is a result which is so very positive that they did n't know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you reach it , they shocked that they 're actually capable of being able to be able to be a <unk> victory .
this player is a short victory .
and this is what we have to see in millions of faces from the world , if we take the squares of the next century , the face of all odds at the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , let 's look at this face in real life when we face tough problems .
i call it as a `` living in life , '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok ?
this is me how i 'm the `` living in life .
this is a graffiti in my former <unk> home in berkeley , california , in my phd school , in my phd of art are better than in games than in real life .
this is a problem that have many player .
we think we 're not in reality as well .
and i do n't just have less successful despite that .
we 're going to reach more . i mean , in the context of the motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired by collaboration .
if we 're in a <unk> , i think many of us are going to turn us in our best version , anytime , and immediately <unk> , the problem is trying to solve the problem so long as well as long as we need to make it again .
and in the reality , when we fail , if we cross the barriers , we 're often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> . we feel threatened , maybe it may be <unk> , maybe it might be frustrated , or <unk> , or <unk> .
we never have these emotions , if we play games , there 's just not just not .
and this is what i wanted to do as a <unk> .
why is it impossible to be impossible to think , you could n't get easy ?
how can we use these emotions into the reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment to the collaborative problem .
and i found some things that can make the epic <unk> in <unk> .
so , first , if you put in one of these <unk> , especially of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters who are willing to get to them , and that immediately immediately .
but not just a mission , but a mission mission , right ?
so , you create that .
you never get one task that you ca n't solve .
but still on the edge of their capabilities , so you have to work , but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you 're not around and simplicity . there 's always a very specific thing to do something important .
and there are tons of workers .
where they 're going to go , hundreds of people who work with them to work with their epic mission .
this is not so simple in the real life , this sense , that it 's a <unk> amount of <unk> .
and also there 's these <unk> story , these inspiring story , why we are there and what we have .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you 've got to be a level of the level , `` <unk> strength '' or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i did n't have a little bit , plus-one speech and plus-one crazy idea , crazy idea .
i do n't get in the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the world of warcraft is that the world of warcraft is that it 's like , there 's how to be so different , anytime at the edge of a <unk> .
they 're just better than the reality .
until now , all the world of <unk> are <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
this is not something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in the context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go to it .
so the first sort of getting <unk> .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we 're going to spend on games , it 's just to make sense of the time in terms of the scale of human flourishing on the scale of human development .
but also , it 's the same way . because it turns out , because we 're using these whole time in play , in fact that we are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do .
we 're developing each other people .
this is the truth . i think i think .
so , look at these interesting statistic , who recently published in a researchers who was published in front of the students in the carnegie university , the average boy of a country in a country with great <unk> with 10,000 dollars to the 21 .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
first , for the united states , in the united states , the <unk> hours of the age is the exact <unk> in school , from the five .
so we 've got a complete complete <unk> , on the young people who are learning how to be a good player , how everything else they learn to school .
and maybe some of you have the new book from malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> . ''
so you know his theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours .
she 's based on the great research of <unk> , that if we have 10,000 hours to spend a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> in the 21st century , we 're going to <unk> .
we 're going to be so good at what the most important people of the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what are the two <unk> ? ''
because if we could find out that , we would n't have to have a human potential for human potential .
so many people we have in the world we have in the world who are at least one hour a day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> , 500 million people who are extraordinary in `` something . ''
and the next decade we have another billion players , which are extraordinary in whatever .
you know , if you 've never heard it .
the <unk> developed <unk> , which is saving energy and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , with the <unk> of the world , especially in india , china , china , china , china , china , china .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have a whole billion player .
so i started to begin to think what it is to do this games to the way .
this is the four things i found . first , <unk> .
ok , imagine how a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately , a challenge , with the faith that we have a <unk> hope on success .
and so , the players are always thinking that a <unk> victory is possible , and that 's always worth it , and that 's the same .
players are not around .
players are masters in the spiders of the spiders .
there 's a lot of more interesting studies that show us that we like people who are more than we played with them , even if you had a negative suffering .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust , to play a game .
and we trust that , someone spends time to give us the rules that we 're going to have the same target and go to the <unk> .
so the game allows you to grow up with each other , trust and each other .
as a consequence of that , we create stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why there 's a <unk> of <unk> , 22 hours per week , like a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we actually are happier , hard to work , when we do it or nothing .
we know that as human beings , we know , we know , we know , if we do hard , great work .
and the players are always willing to work hard , if you get the right job .
and finally , it 's the story .
so players love to be part of some awe of interactions .
here 's a <unk> , to back to the right-hand light , you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> of the world , with nearly 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
you 've got more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than over some other subject of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge of the world of warcraft .
so , these are four superpowers who lead to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
there are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i 'm trying to do .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people have so much time and money in <unk> .
and he says , `` we 're going to be the witnesses from less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and that 's an economist , so he 's logical .
and he says ...
it 's not like i ... i think i 'm playing games , i 'm a little bit more intuitive .
so he says that 's actually making sense , because players can be able to get more than in real life .
they can be stronger and more powerful social ties as in real life , and they get more feedback and reward .
so , he says it 's right now , that player will be more time in virtual world than in real world .
i first agree , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start making the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event , which is six years ago .
there 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> . you know ?
this fantastic fantastic <unk> was <unk> .
and these were the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you 're familiar with the <unk> of the old greek <unk> , you might know the story . the story about how games were invented .
according to <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom of a famine .
laennec , there was such a great famine that the king of the king decided to be a crazy idea .
people were done . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you took a extreme solution .
so she invented <unk> , loud <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , and they would take a national strategy . the next day , you would play .
and they would be so much into the <unk> , there 's so fascinating , and with <unk> , <unk> productivity surrounded that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and on the next day , you would eat .
and according to the <unk> , they survived this famine , by the famine , by the end of a day , and they had a little kid .
likewise , i think , we 're playing games .
we 're playing games to escape the suffering of real world .
we 're playing games to avoid everything in the real world , all of the lives , and we 're going to get out what we need from the games .
but that does n't have no end .
this is the exciting thing .
according to <unk> , the famine were not much better , so the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a <unk> , and they had to be <unk> to a <unk> adventure .
she <unk> <unk> and made a new home , and they were doing so many people back how it had food , and they were able to find the rest of a place where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> <unk> , which is later <unk> the <unk> empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so , scientists recently came to the idea that <unk> <unk> is actually true .
and , geologists found the evidence of a global cooling , which took almost 20 years , which could explain the famine .
so these crazy story could be true .
and you might actually saved her people by play , by using 18 years , and then they had these <unk> , and so that 's how much over each other civilization had saved .
so , we can also .
we 're just playing in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we 've been playing with <unk> years .
i 'm telling us , we 're ready for our own personal play .
so , they sent half of their civilization on the search for a new world , so i suppose my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we want to focus on it , half of us have a lesson every day every day , until we have solved the problems of real world .
i know you 'll ask , `` how do we solve problems of the real world ? '' and exactly this question i have my work on the world .
we have this banner in the office in palo alto , it 's going to understand how to understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best result , and then people are doing that idea in the reality .
we imagine <unk> <unk> and give us the opportunities to reach them .
i 'm going to show you three games that i 've designed to try to provide people in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where you have to get over a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it 's realistic , and they 're going to be able to be in real oil , and then they 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
we tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we 've got them in the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change my life because it 's good for the environment or because we should .
but when you were in a <unk> adventure , and they said , `` it 's oil . ''
this is an amazing adventure to go .
find out how they 're survival . the most of our players have done the game in play habits .
so the next olympics , we have a bigger , higher goal , so it 's even more than just <unk> .
we have the game called <unk> .
what is a little bit of , the computation is that people have only eight years on the planet .
this supercomputer called `` global <unk> '' , of course .
the call on players , you 've got a <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where there is the `` <unk> , '' you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it 's our job to create the future , food and the future of social justice .
8,000 players were playing eight weeks .
they found 500 creative solutions that they can read , if they call `` <unk> . ''
and the last game we take on the three . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you leave the game , you get from the world bank , the <unk> of the social <unk> , in 2010 .
we work with universities in all sub-saharan africa and shop , social entrepreneurs .
we 've got a comic comic book . we have the level of understanding , <unk> , sustainability , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i 'd like to invite you to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , to provide them together to save the world to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happened next ?
we have all of these fantastic player , we 've got games that show us what we can do , but we have n't going to be a real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that player 's <unk> human resources that we can use to work in real lives , and that games are a big meaning for change .
we have these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to provide narrow social nets , <unk> and desire to <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we 're going to play some great games together to survive on this planet .
and i hope you 're going to design me to play and play .
when i put in the next decade , i 'm sure to two things : that we can create any <unk> future , and that we can all play possible games .
so i say , let 's start playing games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something called a few months ago a article for <unk> .
i 've always write my <unk> <unk> , but i was with the process of the <unk> , and i realized that i was never going to be in my life , which is the word `` disabled ''
i read the post .
`` <unk> '' <unk> : `` <unk> , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , rich , sensitive .
and i was looking at this list of a friend loud , and i had to look at first laughing , it was so ridiculous , but i was n't going to be <unk> , and they could n't stop <unk> , and i had to stop reading this <unk> <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that a copy has to be a very old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i started building school in school , and to build my point outside of my family sphere , also in terms of other children , and the rest of the world around me .
and so god is not using a <unk> experiment .
if i would have this post seriously , i would have a world like me as a person who would perceive as a person who can perceive as a person who can perceive as a person who can be able to be able to run their lives in <unk> , but i 'm going to be a chance of opportunities for the opportunities i 've experienced .
so i immediately <unk> up the <unk> of 2009 , and we expect me to find a <unk> contribution .
this is the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it 's not much better .
specifically , the last two words of `` near <unk> '' is , `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about people that we think about these words .
it 's about the values that put in these words and how we build these values .
our language impacts our language and how we see the world and people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the printing force has a big force , because , what you might have loud ,
so what do we want to do , what do we want to do -- a <unk> person or a powerful person ?
you know , a human being used to call a kid , you know , they could <unk> them and <unk> them ideas .
would n't it be nice to open the doors ?
a person who opened me to me , my pediatrician was in the <unk> . <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , who ca n't think most americans could n't mean , so he became dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> was always very colorful , and she was just working with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to repeat these <unk> , and i 've got to repeat it , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- and i know it , i hated it . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine i 've even had a <unk> kid with dr. <unk> , and so i tried to stop these exercises without success .
and one day he was looking at one of my exercises -- these exercises were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're like a strong girl , and young girl , you 're going to get one day .
and when you do it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
now , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. <unk> , so i did n't want to make the exercises that i wanted to be a little kid in the hospital , but he 's actually brought me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes .
and i 'll tell you how much his vision of mine as a strong and <unk> young girl , and i could imagine a lot of nature of nature , powerful and <unk> person .
this is just one example of many , like adults , in <unk> , the child 's imagination .
but how do you 've spoken examples from the <unk> prove that our language does n't give us our language , to imagine something that we would all wish to see , to see each individual people .
our language <unk> stories of the social change , which is in many cases in a technological change .
of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of
so maybe that kind of technological change , because it has always been a different truth , which is that every person can be a very <unk> and very <unk> , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability -- that 's a interesting story , because it 's a interesting story , because people are always going to tell me about it , and i 'm not going to give you something that we 've never had to answer to me , and i felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people to answer the questions of people , and i think , and i think , and i think , i think ,
this sentence from odds live in the idea of the idea that success or happiness depends on the idea of a challenge , without being supported by being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
but the truth is that we change us . of course , we are the challenge of the challenge , whether it 's physically , emotionally or even both .
and i 'm telling you that this is good .
dilemma is no obstacle that we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to get better to see better .
odds are easy to our lives .
and i tend to do it in order to transform against the shadows .
sometimes i realize that he 's very presence , sometimes it 's not to see , but it 's all of me .
and i do n't really want to do it the impact or whatever the <unk> of a person 's <unk> .
there are odds in the lives and challenges , and they 're just real , and each person 's going to be different from it . but the question is not , but the question is not , whether we get to odds or not , it 's not , but not
so we 're not only responsible for the people we love to preserve <unk> , but they 're also going to prepare for it .
and we do n't like our children , if we give them the feeling that you ca n't fit .
you have to get two things , you know , you know , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be , to be a medical fact , a <unk> , and to be a social opinion , whether i 'm being disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and disability , with me , with me to get me , is that the world is all always to describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are looking at the heart , and you know , hard truth to their medical response to the quality of the quality of life , or even a prediction to the quality of life , and even a prediction of life , we 've been looking at that , we have to have the foundation that someone is actually disabled .
maybe this is the current concept that 's just going to be a broken , and how we repair the repair , for each one of a greater disability than the arts .
if we do n't treat a human being , and not all of their forces and expertise , we have to be able to create a natural struggle that you have to have another disease .
we <unk> a person who has a value for society .
so we need to look at the <unk> , and we focus on all the realm of human possibilities .
but most important is that there 's the perception of our degree and our great <unk> .
we should n't get these <unk> times , or historically , we should n't try to avoid them , nor should n't go under the carpet , but it 's about the odds of odds .
now , maybe it may be more about making sure that we do n't necessarily have to compromise it , but that we 're open to a motor , to put them to use a <unk> and dance .
and maybe we can make it godless as something natural , selfish and useful , and useful model and useful , and they feel like that , and feel so fed up with their presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 of charles darwin , and when he has 150 years ago over evolution , darwin , darwin , in my eyes , in something very true of human character .
i would make it so this : not the most powerful way of his way , and not the <unk> of his way , but that 's the change in the way to adapt .
it 's the conflict .
not only from darwin , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , from the fight of human spirit , to turn themselves .
so again , change and destruction are the great powers of people .
and maybe we do n't know what wood we 're <unk> , if we 're really excited .
perhaps this is the sense of odds , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can imagine something like itself .
we can not innovate a new meaning that 's beyond hard times .
maybe we can be adversities as change .
innovate for a change that we have not adapted .
i think the biggest damage we have to have to have the opportunity is to believe that we should be normal .
now , who 's normal , who is normal ?
there is no normal thing .
you have the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would be the normal . and would you want these poor , gray person to learn when it could be really ?
i do n't think it 's not .
it would be great when we have this paradigm of normal versus the strength or the strength , to make it even a little bit dangerous , and so we could release the forces of a lot of kids , and they invite them to be a very special and precious capabilities in society .
so , <unk> have found that we have people from the members of our society are always a <unk> , useful to be useful and a contribution .
now , there 's been evidence that 's the americans ago , 60,000 years ago , and people with <unk> physical injury , and maybe that would happen in the people that would be precious to society .
they did n't look at these people as <unk> and useless , they were treated as something special and precious .
one couple of years ago , i was in the city i grew up in a <unk> lab in the northeast zone , and i was there a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear how a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not <unk> . ''
and i call myself around and see the older man . i did n't know who he 's .
and i said , `` excuse me , sir , i ca n't remember them . ''
and he said , `` well , you ca n't remember me .
when i first saw her , i made her mother . ''
oh , so .
and , of course , it 's made it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i had from stories of my mother over this day , of course , very typical , of my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew my man who brought me to the world , not .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had in front of you , and i had a couple of toes on the other foot , this stranger had to be wrong .
he said to me , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say that you would never run , and you never want to be so <unk> like others , or that you could never run a <unk> life , and you 've just got me just lying . ''
so really extraordinary , i found that he had <unk> my entire childhood , whether i had a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had my fellowship at the <unk> , whether i had my fellowship at the <unk> , whether i had my fellowship at the <unk> of the <unk> or one of my favorite <unk> <unk> , and he used this clips to teach his students , <unk> in the <unk> medical school , and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> factor , the potential of the human being .
you ca n't seem to stress how crucial of this factor can be for the quality of living .
and dr. <unk> told , he said , `` i 've learned that kids , if you 're not going to say anything else , and if you only get a little support , if you get a little support , if you get a little support , when you get kids , then kids can have a lot . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has been changed .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how anyone were doing , two different things are .
and i have changed my thinking in the course of time , if you had asked me in the age of 15 years , whether i would have my prostheses from flesh and bone , i would n't have a second .
i wanted to be normal .
if you ask me tonight , i 'm not so safe .
and that 's happened , because i 've experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experiences .
and maybe that change could also happen , because i 've lived so many people who have open doors , rather than one of people who were looking for me or to be a idea .
you see , it 's really just a person who 's just showing you a person who can show you how they can make their forces , and they are .
if you provide somebody to activate its own forces -- the human spirit is so versatile -- if you can make it , and for someone in a critical moment , you 're opening up to these people , then you 're a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means something that is that in one is that the potential <unk> .
again , the potential is to look at this ?
in the '60s , in britain , in britain , it was done in <unk> .
they call this `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call it as `` <unk> . ''
students are attracted to grades .
and the a students are <unk> <unk> , the better teacher , etc .
and they 've got a <unk> period of students with a wonderful period of <unk> , and it was told you , they were told you that they would be very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote a <unk> .
and of course , there 's a heart attack from listening to the heart of the <unk> , they 're just enough .
and then it was also the three months .
but only the ones who are still in school , except by the students who had been <unk> school .
what about this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
you just said that the student was being a student , and they 're the students with the note , and they have been taught them and they 're being taught them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind who was broken , has no hope , and he does n't find more . he does n't find our natural , difficult curiosity . and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we create it , to support the human spirit of being alive and hoping to find themselves and other people to be beautiful , and then we have to be able to be able to make our forces really positive .
if a spirit about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i 'd like to end up with a poem that was written by a poet poet named <unk> in the 14 century , and from my friend <unk> <unk> , and the poem is called `` god , '' and the god knows , `` every child , '' not the god of the <unk> , but the god knows , he 's just
come , dance . thank you .
