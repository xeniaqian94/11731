yes , good ladies , my gentlemen .
so thank you to talk to the invitation to talk to this .
and i 've got to introduce you now .
my name is christian <unk> , and i 'm a <unk> word , <unk> in the city .
these are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : first of the personal , second organization , third order .
so i 'm responsible for the city of this city .
and you do n't do a popular thing .
i know .
and beyond , and that 's something that 's a son , especially i am also <unk> .
that 's what i call is the boss 's hero department .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and i 've been thinking about this , of course , is a subject to what i want to talk to you today .
and that 's the subject of the <unk> , because of the <unk> .
and we hope to be the best and they 're offering us the worst , which is called the jack of what i said .
you know it .
he was at general <unk> .
and then i 'm just going to begin to say something so much .
i 'm going to give you a way .
so let 's talk to you , if there 's a risk of a disaster , for example , <unk> <unk> , rush hour .
many people are the road .
it 's <unk> .
and somewhere in the edge , a suitcase , lonely , <unk> , perhaps <unk> .
nobody seems to be part .
the suitcase .
suddenly a <unk> .
leave the <unk> .
the police comes , fire , <unk> .
people are calling .
<unk> <unk> .
go out .
what 's going on ?
we do n't know , or we ca n't tell it .
people leave the building .
kids cry .
you might even even fall , because it has to go quickly .
suddenly a piece of communication .
there 's <unk> inside .
it 's panic .
i hear here .
the rest i 'm going to leave your imagination .
but it 's no imagination i 've got to <unk> . <unk> ?
this is what happened in this week in a week .
there 's a pair of suitcase .
afterwards , it turns out that only in <unk> , nine pounds of drugs were in .
but the people were being just like that , and so a friend told me that was forced from the building .
it was not told .
and there was just this particular piece of a sudden at least in the group who had my friend in my friend .
god is not <unk> , otherwise that would n't be as safe as white as it seems like it seems .
you see in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster , in a <unk> disaster in a very important disaster .
communication is important because people are because people in this situation is really different .
you want to know what is going on .
in the good , old time , the authorities was just pretty simple .
we just did n't say , or we do n't stop .
why ?
because this is called the <unk> .
and you 're <unk> to say , god , the people get too much in panic , because we do n't want to say the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a period of social media , in a period of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time of <unk> and public tv .
simple and a funny thing because it 's not moral , and the second is that we 're going to be the last one in the last one , which is about the event .
you might remember the <unk> in the hudson river , which is a couple of year ago .
the first one was about twitter .
and from somebody who was a ferry and just <unk> , and i immediately <unk> , here 's a plane and we save the people now .
this was not a <unk> .
you can see , we rely on it , we have a little bit simple and weird of the world 's state , the truth of the state of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth is really going to say the truth and bring very <unk> .
because of course , of course , of course , we 're also the last , which is the last , which is the truth of truth , because we need to be as a leader , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , is that we only have only <unk> information .
it 's public media or private media either do n't be so much so much , or they do n't do it .
so , of course , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's something that 's been going to be in the media , and we 've got to think about how we deal with the future .
and we 're going to get the good old <unk> <unk> .
but only as a form of <unk> .
that 's what we 're going to do about a hundred years of <unk> in the <unk> , which is , some of you , some of them , if it 's just coming to the <unk> .
it used to be done .
you might know what you know , what 's first , in short , and once a second .
i do n't know .
and we 're going to have these days with all the things that we have to have on this place , so we have <unk> over facebook , over facebook , over the radio , and the local media and the local media and the local media , of course , with <unk> , of course , the information , to
and we know , we have to be very quickly and <unk> , and we need to be a very quickly very quickly and we need to be a very quickly very quickly and <unk> and citizens are going to be <unk> .
and we do n't even think of what we want to say .
communication in the crisis or in the disaster in the crisis is a question of <unk> about all the media that are available to us , and it 's also a question of the credibility .
its credibility is our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens are either saying , `` citizens '' and do n't tell you , it 's not all right , or you say , `` you say , it 's all worse than it is .
so we 've made good experiences with facebook and twitter , recently , recently .
and they may have taken some of these are taken from the media .
we 've had a bigger <unk> in eating food .
and that 's what we call this chemical bomb .
these are bombs who are introduced with a <unk> <unk> , because the first <unk> in the world 's <unk> , but by the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the world 's <unk> , and only in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in world war , which is that a little bit of the chemical <unk> , which is led to two metal <unk> of each other , <unk> two <unk> of each other , and then it came to the explosion .
the problem is just a lot of these suitcase did never work and they 're like in the <unk> of food in food .
and there were a older gentleman , who are his conscience , who he said to be so beautiful in the record , we wanted to go to it , he 'd be able to see , he 'd seen <unk> <unk> , and now , it was informed the authorities that has been informed
by the way , several times has spent <unk> in the entire <unk> .
we 're going to see what we find .
these suitcase were immediately immediately , not <unk> , but <unk> .
and so we have just <unk> in the <unk> park , and i think , a , a bomb , a bomb ?
and in the story in the story of the city , the entire communication in the city of the city , over facebook and twitter , with the consequence of the <unk> , is that the entire <unk> has been followed by the entire island .
and the media was excited . laughter in the background .
we did n't even had to get with the phone who had the phone , but they have <unk> and <unk> , everything about <unk> and twitter .
the whole thing had a great effect for us , because the overhead is going to be <unk> across these social media .
and so simple , you have to give me a sign when i want to stop .
i ca n't look at the watch .
this is the credibility that 's because of because first of these social media has to have a advantage that they 're safe .
not so very <unk> , because the members of the <unk> or the <unk> , how to call them , a high school .
secondly , early <unk> .
if anything does n't be true , you know , someone 's going to be , and someone immediately , the overhead , the overhead , which i 'm just talking about , because the entire community is involved in the <unk> .
and it 's a very high <unk> of <unk> , so if anything is wrong , it can be very quickly .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said , `` well , the exciting thing that became exciting to the <unk> park .
so from all of these things , we have happened in the last few years , and there 's a lot more <unk> than <unk> , as a <unk> of one .
and the city can eat every day from such a disaster .
one bomb that has to be done in <unk> in a park , is certainly not these .
but you can also find out , and then we 're just going to find out of the <unk> , and then we 're standing on our <unk> and try to get back in seven feet .
and if you think , you think of <unk> , you think of other cities , if you 've got out of it , because they 're going to be <unk> , because you ca n't bother a <unk> , then we already do n't know , a lot of houses , a variety of houses that would n't look like before .
and that 's important to communicate , one of the one thing is , because it 's going to be <unk> in a world of <unk> speed at a world , to do communication to worry about that , to worry about that , to worry about that people are going to worry about it , to worry about that people are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to work in these difficult situation .
and the social media also help us , because , eventually , in the communication , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> , and certainly in the <unk> , and certainly in the <unk> of the <unk> .
and so today , today is not just a task of the authorities , not just a task of the power , not a task of <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is the <unk> , but communication in the disaster , but in the disaster , in the disaster and to do it all .
and <unk> has shown this .
there 's a lot of twitter and over facebook , when you were a lot of aid , if you were just too <unk> , because all of people were able to build a little bit more <unk> , and you did n't know where the <unk> are .
and that 's what we 've got to do , there 's a lot too much to do a lot to do for public communications in the <unk> , but the unprecedented present to the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> media , from a <unk> , from a communication , from a communication of communication .
and i hope that i 've been a little bit of a belief that i 've convinced you a little bit of a bit of that , which is actually a little bit of the beautiful things that 's also in <unk> of life , and the purpose of the world 's lives in the future , which is a new tool in the future , and in the future of the world , and the citizens , and the citizens , to the citizens of the <unk> and citizens , and i 'm going to be very much , and
thank you .
this beautiful night .
i 'm a little bit different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you 've heard .
and i 'm just going to give you a little bit of a <unk> .
what it 's is that i 'm going to make there are <unk> there , and i 'm going to give you a moment .
before i do that , but i have to <unk> some things .
the first is , i think , i think , is that we really need stories to life .
that we could n't live with stories .
and also i think there 's a lot more <unk> , <unk> stories , <unk> stories than the entertainment industry .
and i think i think that the internet , which is infinite , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , does n't be done properly <unk> .
and four , i am convinced that i 've convinced that people were created to be creative .
and they 're happier , once you can be happy .
the more people are happy , the better , it 's the world .
it 's logical .
now , this better world is now a crime rate .
in first line , i am like i said , storyteller .
and the story that i want to tell you , it 's starting to be <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in the moment .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> birthday .
now you do n't get it from the <unk> and the singing with it , because in the moment , it 's going to be considered in midnight , something that is happening with .
it happens in your head in your body , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really do a little bit .
you do n't know what 's going on .
now , i have words .
i call this the magician <unk> .
you can see on a page and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite black .
i 'm kind of quite <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we have the two of the country in the country with very much color .
and it was in this point that i said , i 'd like to be better and write as i read .
so , the first thing now is now with her new perception , is a total man with <unk> hair that says , she 's very serious , and says , `` congratulations .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that she belongs to a very special kind of people .
she was born as a <unk> .
the players are people who have to be <unk> at their <unk> to play their lives .
who are the ones who knows ?
very nice .
imagine , you know , the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> , if you get each other , but <unk> from the pocket .
so <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything possible .
what 's really important is that the players have no glimpse on their <unk> .
we do n't know when we die .
i wish everyone 's long life , but we do n't know it .
it can also be all over everything .
and so , it 's what it is in my players .
they do n't know , in order to do how much they can play .
again , that means , every lost person could be the last .
a player who has his entire life is seminal , <unk> in the moment of the <unk> , like a candle that will be <unk> .
now , of course , you can ask , if that is so dangerous , why do you play ?
the answer is quite clear : that 's what it is .
without play , without having a <unk> , <unk> , everything is gray , it 's actually alive .
they were born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how you 're looking at the world of the player , their first challenges , in love with love , that 's the story i want to tell .
and in a form of <unk> .
the first season has 12 consequences , i 'm sorry , i 'm going to be a <unk> that i 've only seen too late .
so 12 , 12 steps in the first season with a length of five or seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence of the other , beautiful <unk> , you know .
television has nothing else for its <unk> .
that 's not new .
and when it would be , i 've got it all over .
and there 's also not here at all .
but it 's just right now .
let 's go back to <unk> .
what is the most famous sentence or from the series ?
it can be one , right .
thank you .
when we had practiced .
and that 's true , which is not true to my player .
and there 's a lot of <unk> .
there are many different games .
think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
and that 's how <unk> is the number of players .
and so there 's a lot of stories , which is all of all of us who are told .
is the next question , who is that to tell you ?
i 've got a fairly high opinion of me .
i think , i think , incredibly powerful and extraordinarily creative .
but i know that hundred brains are more than one , even if it 's mine .
so it came straight to the idea that you were dealing with in the creative process .
what if we 're not just talking about <unk> and allow us , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very much a very welcome to you , the development of this <unk> .
imagine , for example , for example , for example , in the conclusion , a <unk> appear in the end of three months , you know , it 's totally great because it reminds them to their grandfather .
also , they 're a huge fan of <unk> .
and then you can just do , with the technology today , is n't that hard to make a hard time .
and this is the store on the <unk> , where it 's right , and that 's really cool <unk> , which is really really interested in the way .
this is not somewhere , but it goes straight to the right there , where it is to land .
the really nice thing is that we are in the internet .
and in the internet , you can really do everything .
so , the medium is allowed to be allowed .
that 's what you can do as a audience you can write , draw what you want to do .
and now , when we look at this structure .
this looks like a little bit of <unk> web , right ?
that 's how this <unk> is built in common .
and i 'm really important to believe that the internet was born to tell exactly these kinds of stories .
it 's not even so many , you do n't know .
now , now , i 'm going to go on , i 'm going to get a step further , and you 'll get the viewers themselves .
that is in a <unk> .
and there 's the characters in the <unk> <unk> , but also in the real environment , which also these <unk> are on your cell phone .
now , <unk> , you know all of all very good , are like mobile <unk> and <unk> entertainment .
these wonderful areas that are going to develop very rapidly .
and i ca n't go down , because i would have six minutes of time .
we once think together .
everyone 's time it 's from three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> , and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> , i could have the <unk> of the , moment , and i have to find the short statement , the <unk> innovation .
the first price gave me to the best <unk> .
and i 've got to say , this <unk> was from <unk> of banks , from the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so , all of people , should you be my .
and when i could convince the convince here , the internet is really using , the internet is going to revolutionize <unk> structures , by the way , i think , i think i can really convince everyone .
so .
everybody 's time , why is that all right ?
because of this , in this name , all parts are covered .
of course , of course , we have a first thing , of course , who is , who 's it , i 'm on it , you 're , everybody 's time .
and then , of course , this is the dying .
and in the series , very much a lot of .
everyone 's time is , everyone has to die .
and then , of course , everybody is also , everybody 's time in the sense of everyone can make , if he wants to .
this is completely important .
i come from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse than when it 's going to be a <unk> .
i do n't know if you know that .
and when you 're in the theater , and then the actors comes so in the auditorium and all , you know , oh , god , you do n't ask me .
and this is not .
so it 's a interaction .
and nobody has to be .
he can also be the same .
the reason i 'm talking about german is that the whole project is also in german , first .
that 's a few reasons .
and i 'm working with this project , and i 've got to ask , and again , i was asked , and i was always asked to ask me , do the whole thing , do the whole thing in english , demographic , blah , blah , blah .
and i just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then the spanish and then the german .
so it 's not so much as we would move into a little bit of light .
i 'm also really really , really , really , if there 's other people like other people are like me , that people are grateful for something that not been <unk> by any <unk> , where the end of all the <unk> and the <unk> had been held .
so if this is all right now , how i 'd like to have it , the first of the first led to <unk> online .
and when you ask , why i 'm now here now , there 's a <unk> , where it 's going to be <unk> <unk> .
and i 've done some thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just symbolism .
i 'm also quite sensitive to <unk> and <unk> .
a couple of <unk> were also and <unk> .
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredible <unk> .
but it does n't do anything if you do n't use it .
and my project is just <unk> things where i just took all of what i 've learned .
and it 's applied .
and there 's all right .
i 'm just just going to say .
so , when you think , if you think , i think , i think , i think , i think i 'd like to make a part of my part , i had a idea , or i 've got a idea of <unk> , or i 've got a piece of <unk> , or whatever it 's now .
you find us in the internet .
facebook .
great , like the speaker .
yes , i 'm also .
welcome to : can you delete memories ?
question to you .
can you be memory ?
can you remember anything , what happened in your life ?
have you remember <unk> ?
who 's who who can remember everything ?
it does n't go hands up .
so , you can do these memories ?
it seems to be .
thank you .
no , so simple , we do n't want to do it .
now , the talk is quite short .
and good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
now , the talk today , the talk , i was chosen , because it 's two of my passions or my two great physical passions .
i 've got a lot of <unk> , and i 've been able to get the bits of bits and bytes of the bits , which is so big by the world .
and there 's a little bit of time , i 'm also a coach and <unk> in private and a <unk> area .
so on the one side , i have a lot of work with the computer , on the other side , i am in the human <unk> of the human being <unk> in the human <unk> <unk> , so the human being works ?
so how can you change ?
the order to give you a comparison .
i was in a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when can we build a computer that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think there are quite close to it .
so i think so two , three hundred years , it does n't need this .
but let me leave you , why you might have a little bit more .
so the comparison between the computer on the one side and our brain on the other side .
so if we take the computer , it 's all , so your iphone , your tablet , your tablet , the tablet , and all these cameras , and all these cameras , and all these smart refrigerators somewhere in <unk> little chip .
he 's called <unk> , central <unk> <unk> .
these parts are <unk> transistors .
the word `` the word has already heard , and in <unk> , it 's always as a triangle .
the <unk> little device that has three <unk> and light of electricity or not .
in our computer , we 've got to have a lot of <unk> , i 've got a extra <unk> , about five hundred million of these little parts .
and the nest maintenance workers get upset .
we 're storing , we 're storing things , we know , we had a level of albert einstein , yes , <unk> computer can be a lot of a lot , very quickly , but in fact , it can only be zero .
it 's no longer .
it 's actually quite sweet .
let 's change it with our brains .
our brains has as a tiny unit , the neuron , and we have it , and we have it , i 've got a hundred billion , a hundred billion , so , hundred billion neurons in our gray mass , in our gray mass of the mass .
but the nice thing is , our neurons have not only three connections , but they have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
these are 10 to fourteen zeroes <unk> .
so , there 's the complexity of the brain , to be a little higher than what we 've ever done than computers .
if we want to compare the <unk> , maybe maybe maybe the <unk> or another one of the first supercomputer that had your own power boat , ha , <unk> , and with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and our <unk> <unk> , but the box is going to have about twenty watts .
and that 's the equivalent of two great bananas , so you do n't need to do it , and you do n't and your calculators is going to be wonderful .
now , if we 're <unk> a lot of <unk> good part of there , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , why do n't we use , why do we do things ?
maybe one or another one of the people who looks like the internet , which is the person to use 10 percent of its brain , buy it now , you 're going to get this <unk> brain .
and <unk> , <unk> , a little bit .
ten percent , but our brains are in our evolution in the evolution of the mass , which was pretty much smaller , in the middle of the middle , everything else has grown up .
this is not really not happening because we do n't use this .
so why does it seem to be the biggest part of it ?
might you know the term of <unk> ?
i mean , i 'm just like this as a iceberg , when you see the iceberg , in the ocean , it 's the top , the ocean comes down , the ocean comes down below the bottom .
and these 10 percent of the top , that 's about what our <unk> , our <unk> understood is , but is a <unk> percent , a huge amount of <unk> .
we <unk> the statement of what we have to <unk> , and we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> creative .
and , to get back to this memory of these memory , maybe one or other people who are going to memory with <unk> memory .
people who have been looking at a lot more detail at a lot more detail than i did n't see in the situation , and then i told you , `` well , where you know ?
so this is , there 's a special , there 's a special , one of the <unk> , so someone who 's <unk> in a field , who 's been <unk> , who 's been <unk> , in a plane , a <unk> , <unk> , so rome is <unk> , so rome in a plane , so rome is
and it 's not somehow that , so there 's the river , and there is no , no , no , every single house , every single door , every single door , he 's seen , it 's got <unk> , he could bring up to paper .
where does that come ?
so why ca n't that , why ca n't we do that , well , that 's the conjecture that it 's quite a very close to the <unk> order of access to his <unk> percent .
now , we use it , but why ca n't i remember the <unk> night , in all details ?
<unk> <unk> made me to be interesting experiences .
so , for example , for example , for example , in the <unk> , and he was working with a rape <unk> , who had its experience completely <unk> , which was n't mind , the <unk> <unk> of the brain , that 's gone .
wonderful , so that was very well , very well .
but now it was about making people <unk> .
there 's a very safe conference in a very safe blog , where the end of the end or the event could n't remember that event , then they could see that to be able to remember the cars , in which these people would be <unk> , which was n't going to come from the <unk> .
and in fact , with this marker , one of the <unk> had been .
and the second thing i found was , he had a lady in <unk> who told her mother who was read in wonderland , who was read in wonderland .
she was sitting on the lap and her mother read .
and then he said , in <unk> , these <unk> , and the <unk> .
and then she started reading , she was four than that happened , you could n't read this , you can read this .
and then they said , `` tell me the <unk> .
they actually found a specimen of alice in wonderland , where exactly the side of the text is that the lady was read .
so the brain has these side as you was <unk> , as an image .
and she could read .
so , we actually have access to that , but we seem to say there 's a way we have to have <unk> kind of <unk> to <unk> us .
now , now we do n't store the event , but how <unk> said , one of a picture , we do a picture , which is what we smell , what we feel , and what you 're going to think , if you 're going to be <unk> , and how they 're really <unk> , and how they 're going to be able to make a <unk> idea , you know ,
and , it was a long time , it was a long evening , and they 're going to be abandoned comfortable , ha , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and then i 'm going to ask you to ask you , and then you 'll just go and just close to your eyes .
and remember a very <unk> , positive event in the youngest past , yes .
take the first thing .
and , if you do this now , you might think that you get a visual part of this memory .
you might get a picture , maybe even a film ?
some of the things that does n't mean , because we do it so normal , but that 's the first time that they do .
and if you see that , you can see that they 're either in the film , from your eyes , your eyes are all in your eyes , or how they look at a canvas .
one of the call we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you very much , you can not solve the thoughts .
who has a visual information , for hand , hand ?
yeah , there 's a few hands on a few hands , which is so , so that 's how to say , `` well , third of it , i would say , what i would expect , it 's actually something that we often do so often that there is not a lot of terrible thing .
well , <unk> .
and so what 's nice is about memory , if you 're memory , they 're not just not just that memory , you do n't get these memory to a memory , which is a positive event , and i would have beautiful , and i was laughing , you know , you know , and that 's the memory of the memory , maybe
and now , what is fascinating .
and in fact , it was , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , we do n't have a difference between what we actually 've ever reminded and what we just imagine , what we 're doing .
also , you can try and try and you might try and you can watch them at home <unk> and imagine something in the future , which is not going to be able to get things like something , if you remember what was in the past .
and , you know , these stories you 're telling you to talk about <unk> , from back .
and then , you know , hey , there 's what happens , and this is so nice , and the longer the stories are , the nice thing , the night , there was a lot of <unk> , there was a lot of <unk> , there was a lot of different , there was a lot more higher .
so if we do that in the mood , so if we actually change our memories so how we do n't we do it , i ask you ?
<unk> , when i came here , my uncle showed a picture , from his hut in switzerland .
a very nice picture , it 's a very nice hut .
only , the image is `` <unk> , '' so it 's artistic freedom , there 's a <unk> <unk> , because it 's a gorgeous dog in the alps , that 's a picture of the alps , that 's
and why do n't we do this with our own thoughts , and we do our own memory , and our own memory , hey , what i think , because , when i do that , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , when i do that , what i think of it , which i think ?
they actually have artistic freedom in their own thoughts .
and you know , you know , you know , you know , so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you
yeah , i 've got bad , i was the whole <unk> .
the whole night , and this idea did n't go out there .
i think it 's not going to be the idea of the thoughts .
and the son <unk> friend of mine was a little depressed when he came down , because his mother stayed in <unk> , and he just did it .
what the father has done , so he 's <unk> with the son , and he said , `` what was the most beautiful , what happened ?
and what was the nicest , you know , tell you , and then he has to tell him , and then he got him , has to tell him exactly what 's great happened .
and , in two weeks , the son was doing .
and then there was okay , which is the <unk> way to come back .
and the whole thing is that the whole youth is done about the , which is one of the most popular people i know .
so it 's not the memories that are shaping us in the way we are , but it 's our focus on what we use .
and how much energy we use to use or use it .
so if you were <unk> <unk> thoughts , and say , this was <unk> , which is so much , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
so what <unk> is , ah , what nice , yeah , <unk> , <unk> , yeah , `` oh , '' that 's nice , man , man , that was beautiful ?
and then you take that with it .
take this with your <unk> and let me see it .
or if you <unk> somebody <unk> , it 's <unk> her boss , or your boss , or her wife , or her husband , you know , <unk> , it 's <unk> .
so , you take the picture here , put it a little hat , hey , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the background , you laugh , why do you laugh ?
because they 're looking at , because these ideas are funny .
and you can get much better with the situation .
so can i mean , `` well , memory ?
no , i think our brains have so much capacity that it can store everything .
but it 's nothing , because we can choose a lot of , how much we focus , and how important we think , a thought of thought , it 's going to be on us .
my plea to you you , you 're playing with you with the images in your head , use your power of your <unk> , and give it every day , the lives .
boy : good afternoon .
thank you for inviting .
and when i ask for a party , what i 'm doing so in my school , and i 'm telling you that i do together with friends , and they 're going to go out with friends , and then i see shining eyes , and in the minds of the audience <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and when i <unk> , it 's a <unk> called <unk> music for classical music , which is that <unk> <unk> <unk> images of the old people who are in <unk> and very focused on the arts in <unk> .
frank <unk> said to talk about music is so to dance .
and so that 's what we do with what we do .
so you can get a glimpse of what i 'm talking about , i brought you a short movie .
film .
there 's something that is impossible to be <unk> .
this brings it from my view of the point .
and since <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> are <unk> , something completely different .
we are now , of course , and in the middle of the <unk> , and the end of the middle , the end of the end , the end of the end , and the end of the end , the end of the end , and the end of the end , we had a lot of early in our youth , which is a lot of the incredible force and <unk> music .
but we have also experienced that the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , there 's a little delight , you know , a little bit .
and we are the permanent belief that the future music is not on the content of content , so on music itself , but of your <unk> .
so we ask the question , how can we create a <unk> , that the music is near the friends , the friends and the power again , that we like so much .
how can we organize a <unk> , which works beyond the <unk> of the <unk> ?
we imagine the parameters that you know from the classical concert , space , time , space , essentially in the question .
let 's take the relationship between the audience and musicians .
you usually have a gulf between the stage .
we 're trying to be a <unk> .
here you see a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians sit in the audience , drink beer , entertain people in the <unk> with the world , stand on , are a , two pieces , stop in audience .
this is a little bit of a little bit of the evening .
everyone who is doing is <unk> , comes back to the stage .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
the classic concert is that you 're on more or less comfortable , <unk> chairs , like you here , and watch out and listen .
but there 's music , there 's no way you ca n't be quiet .
and we 've done the idea how you can do this .
if you 're sitting different and you can put yourself in a <unk> piece of music , you 're automatically listening to different .
and that 's how we did n't have a stage , but four stages of the world .
the audience could have been <unk> .
that 's how a night was in the first row .
it 's important to us is that we do n't just make a little bit more sophisticated , but that 's the music of thinking .
so that 's what we ask us , what are the spaces and the <unk> way to the head of the people who need music how they 're supposed to work ?
and then , in <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the s is actually <unk> by <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , in old <unk> .
but not just the spaces , and the illumination can get music and currently now , but also the connection with others .
and so we 're completely happy that we 've been working with a few years , with a few years , with the <unk> of the <unk> or in the movements of music , which is actually not in the dance .
and then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , <unk> for <unk> or <unk> are steve reich .
and in this year , we have a , yeah , if you want to get this one .
we have a concert in the first time with a <unk> system .
we have the story of the soldier from <unk> <unk> , dancers , <unk> , and they 're <unk> <unk> .
and so that 's also true of all , because we had a big <unk> , which led us in this piece .
we 've got a lot of money in a lot of money from people from the people from the <unk> , so that we could have been an effort .
at all , this <unk> is something called a community of community .
we 're completely happy to have a <unk> in the city of a home .
and the city is , which is exactly the size that we have great spaces and exciting places for systems , but also so small that we are .
if the start of the year in the spring of the year , <unk> of europe has been in the city in the city , then easy to the city more people are normally <unk> .
the whole <unk> is called <unk> .
we 're a colorful <unk> mixture of students and students , medical school , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally completely connected .
and to give a <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> or coordination , and funding in the eye , <unk> seven to 10 , <unk> makers in a year , provide <unk> jobs .
but it 's also <unk> , but they 're spending a year for example , for example , the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> in permanent hands are organized and the <unk> .
we all do this in our school and live in a very germany .
that 's called the largest part of work , and we have a <unk> .
just three times we 're going to talk about a <unk> weekend , a <unk> weekend , <unk> , <unk> or another problems , which came up with each other , and have the human being able to be incredibly important in the ground .
and in <unk> , then we have six to 30 volunteers who have been <unk> , or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks of the hands , and there 's a few weeks to their hands , and you can touch your hands , and they 're being able to touch with the <unk> , <unk> , in the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days , the musicians come to .
now , you might have my , you could have anything you need to have a <unk> .
but our <unk> still continues .
and we have a big community in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city , in the city , in the city , in the city , in the city , in the city , in order to build us in which we want to do .
that 's the classic <unk> , which is also about very practical things like , for example , because we have a baker , which is a baker , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is going to provide fresh food .
the <unk> is going to be done in a <unk> in the city over the entire year and sold .
until the <unk> .
we 've found a whole range of groups who have found ourselves to provide their living room to provide the musicians there .
and in this way , the <unk> is going to be a piece in this city and over the people in this city .
they 're in a very special way of doing this <unk> .
since the early year , we could have been <unk> support by the citizens in the world , which is a <unk> in the lives , which is now going to provide the whole value in a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
we 're <unk> from the stage that classical music is <unk> it , it 's not going to come in the right hands .
and so we 're incredibly happy about that in the whole europe , a young musicians of music music in their own hand , and home in the cities .
now , if you ca n't imagine the right now , how to find , classical music , you get just over .
next year , we 're back in <unk> , and we would be happy when they 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you might think you might have to know .
you 've heard about learning or the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn more more , which is also a lot of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and i 've got to know what 's experience is a nice formula for the <unk> .
so what i 've learned from art and culture , now , i can say , there 's a lot of natural , because there 's ar <unk> , i 'm in this field .
and so i 've been thinking that maybe it might be a little bit of saying that something called a different title of a different title of what my talk is .
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot of work .
now , you have a little laughing .
you 're always going to see laughter , although most of the adage .
why is that ?
i think that 's what that has to do that in the word beautiful , what we ca n't really grasp .
art , we 're also saying that .
now , in the work , we say , this is what it has .
sometimes .
people who like to work , which has me to me .
but in work , we think about the <unk> and in the art of the art of life , where we 're going to move in our lives , our experiences are going to develop our own ideas .
and so i 've got my <unk> , which i want to talk to you , in about three hours , which have been all the headline , and that 's what it starts to be very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for childhood , for a little bit , on inspiration , for inspiration , for the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not going to tell all from my youth , no concern , i 'm going to give up the word `` i got to explain why i took this for my <unk> .
the interaction for the first part of my professional life and finally , five , was identification .
one of them is going to know these pieces of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn it as in the first two , three years , when you teach , and i 've been working on .
and so 10 , 11 , i played these little pieces , on the piano , not far from here , on the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of a <unk> live .
there 's a melody , and the other voice is <unk> , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , is a <unk> of art , and if it 's only two voices , and if it 's together to think of the present , the past , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , things , the most of the things that are together ,
and i 've learned that , and i 've learned two melodies , sometimes three , at the <unk> <unk> , in the same way , in the same way , in the same way , to hear a kind of mess , which is
this was what i 've learned , under other ways .
another experience i 've never forget , and i had the concern that i could still do today .
i 've got a piano , and i 've got more people in the room , and in the middle of the <unk> , i got out .
i 've forgotten it .
i 've played .
so again , again , i started talking about the same person , i did n't know .
the audience has more <unk> than i was , because i was in the rest of my place , my notes , put them down , and i started the third time .
and they do n't believe how to me have me behind me .
but that was a very difficult experience .
maybe that may also be one of the experiences where i knew i knew , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you might have a <unk> , i would n't want to go to my <unk> , because you can cheat so much easier .
yes , the next chapter of my adolescence , i 've got <unk> with inspiration and i want to tell you stories .
when i was so <unk> , i was to my <unk> , and he said to him , `` i would like mr. <unk> , i 'd like to play a <unk> .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
there 's a lot of <unk> , and very much experience with women .
now imagine a <unk> young man , so , a sentence .
i did n't forget .
and of course , of course , i 've got more working with this .
and at the way , i was by the way , and in a <unk> .
i 've spent working , and i remember a situation that i 've never experienced that .
it was the <unk> of the chopin , and now i get to the part of my work , and i just did n't get a place , and she was with the most beautiful place , very broad , and then you had to do the arms together and then again ,
now , i ca n't play it now , is not a piano here , and i could n't do it .
i 've got these in the shoes , 30 times , playing , and suddenly , she was right .
and then i was playing , and i was playing , and i was playing in a sense of embarrassing , and i just know that i would get me to the ground and laughing .
i was except for me .
i had nothing to not drink anything , and the music has done this with me .
one experience where i 've learned , really , emotions , are really interested in .
and sometimes it 's right to work that you 're going to work in this kind of <unk> , in these condition , i call it .
where it 's going on .
we had this situation in the <unk> <unk> in a organization .
and then there 's almost anything like the way we made the <unk> , that 's just two months , and then you took a half months , where you would normally have a year of a year .
now , these were my sighted with the piano , with artistic work .
and now i come to my student , <unk> .
i was first a musician , but just as a <unk> .
we played <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i gave <unk> , and i 've got so much next to my <unk> for the music for the music , and that was the <unk> .
in the choir , in the choir , together , a <unk> singing , wonderful experiences that are very , very far .
and then one point , where i was a <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> and the <unk> , and i made this story , and i got this <unk> , because of this idea of art , from this combination of art , culture , i was in the <unk> event , but law
and that 's the art of culture , to make a <unk> .
so , for the arts , but they do n't be an artist , but it would not say , `` it 's not going to say , '' but if you do n't say , `` do n't you say , '' but it 's not going to say , `` do n't you say , '' but it 's not going to be <unk> , but to do it as a <unk> .
i was there in theater , and i was <unk> , there was no <unk> in germany , just in vienna , in vienna , and in the middle , i 'm still <unk> , and from there , i 'm going to deal with this question , to make art for art to build a good management , a good management ,
and this was the reason i did not stopped in my professional life , in the direction of this <unk> , and i grew up with <unk> years , i was then <unk> .
but one of the other <unk> , and this stage i have been <unk> with interaction .
i came to the german <unk> .
the german <unk> has his <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , although sometimes in my surprise , because i was born in <unk> , always , the <unk> oliver <unk> , i got to <unk> it .
but i have a <unk> root , because my grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i experienced the <unk> .
that was something that i was before , what i did n't have so popular , and suddenly i got in a different form of culture , in a culture , which lived in this <unk> device in this <unk> device .
as soon as the <unk> of us , all of us , all in a different situation , in very different states .
and i started with <unk> <unk> , which is the future of <unk> and <unk> , who was my friend and colleague , and i 've always made music to music music , and the guitar , i played a different one , i could be a different school teacher , for example , i could be <unk> , for example ,
we 've done the <unk> <unk> , so , of course , of the <unk> of the <unk> , months , months .
and this <unk> , which is really from the people .
it was my destiny that i had learned from november november for my <unk> , and i did n't know that the wall fell .
i woke up at the next day , i had the examination , oh , the wall , yes .
so , i 'm going to think about it , for each other questions , for example .
and down , i was <unk> for the cities in the <unk> .
and again , i 've experienced that interaction like interactions of each other cultures .
in fact , we 're talking to the same language that music is going to be beautiful and became wonderful , but a lot of it became great , <unk> .
unlike the <unk> , it did n't come from the people themselves , but it was a lot of the top of the top of the top , and i 've been looking at a great asset , there 's the german identity , and then i got back to it , and then the german
since , germany is <unk> .
the <unk> of the <unk> are much more sophisticated cities .
and that 's interaction , but i 've learned all things , and i had food in the city .
and we have a <unk> , by the way , you 've got a <unk> , imagine that when i started here , <unk> , stood up in culture and play .
i still have the same .
so for example , for <unk> , you did n't want to write <unk> and <unk> .
and i was the first director of the <unk> .
so i 'm not so much so much so much so much so much , anyway , that was wonderful , that i had this <unk> , but she disappeared , but she disappeared because i was going to be in education and make alliances to education and make alliances .
we have a lot for the urban <unk> , we 've only have this kind of <unk> between the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , which we 've got to experience of the <unk> and architecture , from the <unk> in the blue stones .
many , many interactions , we could create , and i could create , and i 've experienced , and we 've experienced what that means when different people could pursue together .
and you know , by the way , by the way , i 'm always more <unk> of the art of art , more of the culture , and more of the culture , which is the most important between people , between cultures , and then i get back to the way , but i get back to the arts .
interaction was also a story between the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , seven <unk> , seven <unk> in january january , the <unk> could be in the <unk> of europe .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter has been identification .
so this word has two meanings , to me , i <unk> me to something , so i 'm going to use something , and i can also use it as a verb , and say , i mean , i 'm going to know something .
and that 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i 'm going to <unk> you or the community .
and i 'm <unk> with something when i 'm going to talk to me and say that , i 'm telling me to identify me .
and that 's a very big action .
five point three million people are trying to move , <unk> cities , to identify in the double sense , and recognize that you are a community in europe .
when big , we 've called <unk> , but anyway , as a community of many people who are in a big <unk> lives , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , this is our key nations , and that was our key to <unk> the identification of the people , and of course , of course .
in the signs , the <unk> of the highway , many times .
a experience of the <unk> did n't have some people in the <unk> .
and there was <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , working , young girl , from <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> students from a <unk> school , <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> from a play , from a play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dear , <unk> , dear , dear , dear , `` dear , dear , ''
and it was a particular effect that young girl quoted from boys and young russians then came from young men in something like a <unk> german .
and there is one of these young men in the piano , and playing this <unk> , which i loved that loved .
and he says , and he was quoted from a letter , and he said , `` i wrote a letter , he wrote him home , and he wrote him home , and i wrote him home , and i wrote him home , as young german , and i could never play a <unk> , because my two fingers are just <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger with a <unk> , and he was trying to give up the piano in a <unk> , and tried to play the <unk> .
and it did n't made him .
it was so a <unk> scene that i was going to jump up , said , what did we learn ?
we 've learned in the <unk> , that many people can go together , but in all things , we 've learned that we are going to be more years in peace and the culture that we do n't have to go out of culture , because we 've got different languages that we have to feel .
and that was a wonderful experience , and you see it 's not just to learn something .
it 's all about learning to experience and <unk> .
and if we invent a lot of inventing and invention , if we 're going to give it out of art and culture , our own location , when we interact with our own identity , by connecting art and culture , then we 've got all
and i hope that you 've got a lot of <unk> and <unk> , from which they make this asset .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think we 're waiting for the first picture .
so i have to support the support of my memory , so a few slides .
but it 's not a scientific slides , but it 's going to me , in my <unk> here , to find a direction , and i think about how i think that i think that 's the next few years .
now , by the <unk> words , i finally know , thank you , thank you , thank you very much , thank you very much for a lot of what ted is , and i think , in the area , we can make this talk very much .
and then i had heard that you should have a talk in english , but if you 're looking at the talk , you see , you would n't understand what i wanted to say on english , and so i did n't know how to say , and so i did n't know the talk , and so i left
how we 're going to die .
i have to tell you all of the <unk> .
<unk> was in the hospital i had the <unk> <unk> , and she was <unk> .
she was over <unk> years old , and she was like to be dancing , because she was too aware of the man who was in the first man who was in war .
and so you 've gone to the first year to the first may , and then long <unk> , and probably then a <unk> <unk> , and then she 's <unk> , and then on the right side , you see the leg cracked , the <unk> .
a few years before , she was also <unk> and had the same way , with equal reasons , had broken the left leg .
and then i was also a doctor in the doctor , and i 've been able to be a doctor in the intensive care of the intensive care of the intensive care of the intensive care , when they were treated with antibiotics , and have been the conversation in the conversation , and the conversation has been able to be able to say , is that it was going to make sense ?
does it make sense of a way to make a <unk> of intense technology ?
so , in order , to <unk> , in intensive weeks , is that a human being done at ?
and she 's been cured of cured .
five years later , i get in the clinic , and i see the names , and i can remember , and i 'm going to remember , and i 'm going to remember that , because it 's just a little bit of time , and the dance was broken down the other leg .
so the question is , the question is , what i 'm doing is , what i 'm doing is , when i 'm doing , when i talk about how a person to decide what he 's going to say , `` what he 's going to say , '' or what he 's going to <unk> ?
and this is a little bit of the subject of the <unk> .
and you see the <unk> of the called <unk> .
it 's a book from <unk> , like we 're going to work , a report on the <unk> .
and then it was so that the globalization was very strong , so that you have to ask yourself , how can it go to work with you .
and then you 've got out , and you can also read it in this book , and i said , you know , it 's going to be a quality of quality , so the parts are always going .
it 's going to be the work of the work that 's going to be <unk> , it 's going to be a lot more stronger , for example , this was a big subject .
and that 's also , basically the work of the individual , so something that has been a <unk> , something that has always <unk> stronger and the <unk> has been <unk> by the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality .
and that after that assessment , people still have less self-confidence , and more part of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , where it was to achieve high levels of <unk> , and not to define his work .
and if we 're going to transmit this now in the <unk> and medical range , there 's something that 's right now .
when you hear in television , what doctors and caregivers and also <unk> , the so-called <unk> , it 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else that has to be accepted , what you 've done , is that it 's done , so it 's going to be paid for it , and if not prepared it , then the medical service is also , we do n't pay for those health or the health treatment .
and through this documentary , but it will be more <unk> and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
a good friend of mine had gone now to holland , because he did n't want this to be more mature , who had a <unk> practice , has left up to be the doctor to be <unk> .
the <unk> are mostly in these systems , and he had the martin , who had never been able to have more old people in the age of the <unk> , the hospital , and back , because the <unk> did n't know what they should do when it should be worse .
and then the hospital is going to be <unk> , go back to the <unk> , or <unk> , and they 're going to continue there .
and this family was really thinking , if there 's a little bit more <unk> in holland , then i want to let me to run something like this <unk> of the <unk> and also <unk> <unk> from people .
now , in the way , in the netherlands , he had to find out , after he had learned the language with a lot better , that 's exactly what happened in this <unk> .
it 's going to be more connected to die .
it 's not more the credibility that counts , but you put in one available , i want to be <unk> , or not in the hospital , if i am in the hospital .
and then the <unk> is .
in holland , it 's so , in the third days , a conversation is going to find a conversation with the moment , and then you have to put in the hospital , or i do n't want to be in the hospital , or i do n't want to be in the hospital if i 'm going to happen .
that 's the same thing that i want to be here , i want to be <unk> , or i do n't want to be re-inhabited .
and this data is going to go on a central , and there 's the doctor 's <unk> , and it 's always the <unk> and meets the decision of this foundation .
now , if we 're looking at <unk> , which would be in the may , and even more and even more and once , and we imagine , who would have an accident , i would n't want to be an accident , i would n't want to be an accident , i would have to be able to be the second dance in may , where she 's going to
and this raises my friend now , who 's sitting there in holland , too much more <unk> , as he is about it .
in the last , it 's so tribal today is about <unk> percent of the people who are not dying at home , but in hospitals , that 's the <unk> , and it 's often the ability to be a lot of <unk> , but it 's often a profound amount of
there 's a little bit of living , which is very good , there 's very <unk> people who are going to look at this , but if i look at the <unk> patients , and we 've got about <unk> patients in the year , so about it , i would say , it 's very difficult to say , it 's very difficult to say , it 's hard to make it hard , and
and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , this is quite clear , which is quite clear , this entire quality of quality , is because of the money that people are going to do , and that the people are going to be online , and that the people are going to be able to say , to be good , and that the people who are going to say to be good , because i 'm going to be
it 's just not the reality , but you need two salaries in the <unk> and <unk> and most of it , and most of it 's just a little bit more .
this introduction of quality as a result of a period of a sudden , of a very constantly growing market , which you want to regulate , so on the individuals of these subjects .
and now i 'm going to get out how to escape , so what do we do now in the last , because i 've got the first questions , and demonstrated that , the situation is not .
and there 's just the <unk> <unk> and the article one of me , because i think a society needs to have a society , also the <unk> structures , which is going to happen in our society .
and in the <unk> article one is , one would be <unk> .
and the second sentence there is to protect them , is the <unk> to all the <unk> .
and what i 'm not missing is a third sentence in that , which is that every single one of the individual should have to have the assignment to protect its dignity and defend .
because that 's a way of <unk> itself from this case , i 'll give another way , and i 'm going to give me some of them in the way , and then i 'm not going to give me a way to me , and then i 'm not going to give me a kind of thought of thinking about how i 'm going to die .
because the last thing is , even though , when we do n't like to talk to this subject , we 're going to come to the point of the point .
hopefully it 's not too late or <unk> .
and of course , i 'm also saying that in my job , i want to say , and i want to give you , and i want to worry about , but if you have to ask yourself , but if it 's a little bit of , if it 's a little bit , or maybe it 's a little bit of <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , to say , `` i 'm going to be late in life , i want to think about this question .
now , if you think about what 's doing about what 's doing my life , then you 'll come on the next step , which are the five most important things in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is quite a <unk> <unk> .
and it 's the self-esteem , of course , it 's the friends i 've got to talk to me and exchange me , who know me and me know me , and the <unk> of my life , it 's the <unk> .
it 's safe between people who i might have to do , with the <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , or another person , where i have in the relationship .
and there are a lot of individual factors , of course , which is <unk> there , i do n't go through .
but when you look at these three points , you 've already have a whole bunch of tasks , how you have to have a lot of life , to protect the last one in the past .
and then another factor is that we have a certain cause of the <unk> of the <unk> , i got this one as a text as a text , or as an example .
other people can have these decisions for us and behavior , which is missing .
that 's my inner conviction .
our dignity can only come from us .
so it 's not the question , because other people who will do , who will be me for me , who will be for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , or for me , for me , or for me , for me , or for me , for me , who 's going to me ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to ask , where can i work on people , where i could do , and i could get my inside of the inside , that i could deal with these questions , and i can deal with these questions , and i can handle it .
and when you 're going to say , so we 're going to work , so these inner quality , it was a way to say , i 'm going to <unk> me about my inner system , to escape this mechanism .
because you ca n't want to give me a person who can me feel like me , because i want to see myself and the way to see .
and i do n't have to fit in a lot of <unk> or opinions who say , you 've got to get a steady <unk> , and because you 're so old , i think you want to be in a intensive care .
these questions that can probably be a long time in a long period of <unk> , probably <unk> .
these would be a inner stance of the people who can be in the outside of me , and that can not be from the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside , which is not the law of the nation , and i would also be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more <unk> when i had a person who have been on the ones that i 've got in the way that i 've got in the way that i 've got to have before , which i 've ever been
and to make these conversations , it 's going to take spaces , and i think i 've got this talk , and so this is a conversation like the <unk> in food , which i have to be able to think of a picture , where it 's really a conversation that 's not a conversation , but that 's a conversation
so if we 're old , if you 're old , you can say , well , a dance in may , despite my may , despite my very high age , which would be .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful nice evening .
i get two things with .
when you 're flat to flat , you 're a little bit more precise .
it 's a second .
let 's begin with infinite .
that 's stupid , not , you can take .
what do you mean ?
are there different kinds of <unk> ?
or is it infinitely enough ?
yeah .
this is not good when there 's one thing that looks !
so , in fact , but i 'll just wait it , for the ones that know .
that 's exactly what we do .
we 're just looking at a single one .
and i <unk> to a little bit more .
<unk> , we know , make infinite infinite form , we have to know a lot .
and it 's for the <unk> of the magnitude of scale .
when we 're in the <unk> , and we count two <unk> in the other hand , in the other people .
we know , now , now , we 're looking at now , we 're looking in the box , which is tiny , it 's three chairs and it 's three people .
we can check whether in every amount of a lot of the same number of elements in there ?
is how would we do it ?
so , that means , we would be first <unk> , one , two , we have three , we have three , we count the chairs , see three chairs , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three .
that 's what i mean , yes ?
very nice .
this works in a fairly wonderful , which works also in big numbers , although it <unk> .
but it fits .
how can you count it ?
how do you stand there , so many people like chairs ?
i 've been aware of chairs and people and not what else .
yay !
it 's called the mate !
well , you know , it 's fine , you 're not , now we 're in the day , and we 've got to understand it !
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , it 's called <unk> a <unk> and it works just the same , yes ?
you take one , you get a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , path , the next <unk> , everything is power , and there 's a lot of chairs , no chair , it 's empty , and the crowd are right ?
now we 're going to go into infinity .
how can we be two infinite tips ?
we would say that 's a big or bigger or bigger than others .
we could do it ?
we would go back .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is , if you 're going to count in a infinite long , yes , yeah , i would just say , do n't get to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so , how is it ?
<unk> ?
no way , <unk> !
she was just going to begin .
mate !
so , let 's look at this .
estimate , you appreciate it 's bad , right ?
you see , you do n't see , yes , right ?
so the point is , you know , it 's quite easy .
if i take a <unk> , natural figures , <unk> , we need computers , we need zero , zero , one , one , two , four , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five ,
and we would say , let 's just say a replica of this <unk> , and you take off this copy of these <unk> , the infinitely <unk> figures .
left , the numbers are , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinitely long band of the natural <unk> , but on a band , the <unk> , the <unk> , on the other , on the other are the straight and the <unk> , okay ?
let 's call a lot of gs of the straight numbers , we call the other amount of n the natural numbers .
what do you believe ?
is grams more powerful , is it bigger than n , or smaller or smaller ?
right ?
but that 's very soon , yes , is a lack of <unk> .
who are another estimate ?
little bit ?
who is getting bigger ?
ah , that 's no plan , yeah ?
that ca n't be , yeah ?
you ca n't find where what is missing , bigger , that 's not what ?
okay , you say little ?
would you suppose ?
this is the popular , what you might have , is of course .
and now i 'm going to explain why the amounts of are the same .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the linear <unk> , we take the zero from the natural amount of , they get out .
the next of the zero , after two , two , after the zero comes one , and i 'll get a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the eight , the four , yes ?
you can turn that , and then it 's doubling that 's obvious , <unk> ?
and completely clearly , by the <unk> , we create it that i 'm going to do it in the lecture .
and there 's one , there 's just the straight line on and the band is the same , yes , yes ?
we <unk> the natural on the linear , <unk> , <unk> , and the band are still right .
this is just in infinite .
so , if you 're going to explain some of what we 've learned today , even if you 've learned , yeah , what 's infinite , i know ?
a infinite set has a quality , which is there 's not in the <unk> , and this trait is , is absolute <unk> , a real subset that 's exactly the size .
and you ca n't do it in a <unk> , if you put three three people , it 's just one there , and they were three .
yes , we 've done infinity .
none of them is a <unk> ?
okay .
then we have a second part , probability .
the professionals , there 's a lot of probability of probability .
here 's what i 'm doing .
now , in this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's at least one third , and someone makes someone who has on the top , yes ?
so , let 's call the doors a , b , c .
i 've got behind anything , i hope you would n't hear it .
and you have to have a little bit of guess .
where my mind , i have a little bit hidden , behind a , b or c ?
guess what , our <unk> , here .
they estimate c .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has a idea ?
no , <unk> , b is missing , not , otherwise , you know , stop , `` yes ? ''
that 's right .
it 's really no matter , so you do n't have to be my , three letters , and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really anyway , yes ?
it 's completely clear because , because , the chance you have , is that you 've got lucky , it 's all of a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really no matter , right ?
now , here 's what i 'm doing is , i just do one .
well , i know , of course , where it 's .
<unk> , this has someone who has <unk> .
so , i know , yes , where it 's , and the guess what is , or what you think , or the estimate or whatever you call it , is going to a second round .
so i 'm really proud of the game i 'm going to tell you now , i 'm just going to be just <unk> .
so it 's like , we go into a second round .
now , now , i suppose i was looking at a , <unk> ?
so , i 've got to show you a door , behind it 's not behind it , and they did n't say .
because if you say b , and i say , and i know it 's not behind b .
there would n't be a second round .
and then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , good luck .
but i have to say , `` yeah , it 's <unk> , in the second round .
so i can just give a open , behind it 's not just not , but what you did n't have told .
now , the question is , and that 's the kind of probability of the condition , under the condition , under the condition , under the condition that it 's open , and it 's not that it 's not behind .
you 're allowed to stay in a stay , i 'm really excited .
i 'm going to do what you want .
or you say , i do c .
now , the <unk> is now going to be more likely ?
protocell , very nice , b is on , i know it 's behind c .
or , but , but , god is that b is being open , i always wanted to stay in a stay .
or would you say , `` well , we 've got to have , <unk> , way , we 've only have two doors , now , to continue .
what do you mean ?
it 's not anyway .
<unk> .
why is n't it anyway ?
very nice .
why is it <unk> ?
yes , right , that 's wrong .
that 's what it looks like , when we had yesterday , <unk> ?
but so they are , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , the thing that is really <unk> , yes .
the understanding of all , i do n't know , do n't know , six and , yes , i ca n't get <unk> , otherwise i 'm not going to leave you to come back ?
so there 's all of everyone .
behind this door , it 's a third .
and it 's always just a third behind a door .
you can guess what you want to have , you have two thirds of the <unk> .
and that means you could have to think of two doors , not , you ca n't have in <unk> , you can put in two dozen , it 's <unk> , if you get the zero , which is all right ?
but here we have a door .
so , so , the answer is , two thirds is not what you do .
so the two third here is , but it can only be behind one door !
it 's not .
so , what 's more likely ?
no way , i really hid .
so , what is more likely ?
it 's better to remain , to stick or move ?
now it 's easy , right ?
yes , of course .
so , that was n't hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what do we see ?
you 've had a <unk> .
why ?
just simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for each other .
thank you .
mr. <unk> , you know , she was <unk> <unk> <unk> who 's just a bad diet and bad food and poor food and overweight people who has been reported , it 's completely .
but i 'm betting my best , that it 's gone .
i 'm coming from <unk> farm and knew until i was 12 , no mcdonald 's no doctor .
that 's all the way , right .
yeah .
thank you for inviting us .
i grew up here in the ground .
and i do n't know if mr. <unk> was so on the answer , if i want to talk to the ted conference , and talk about a particular note .
i 've got to trust me , and that 's the topic .
now , motivation , motivation is not bad and i <unk> me of the woman who said , maybe one or another , more sports .
i also have a whole thing .
so tonight is now going to go to a night now , now , a lot of demands , but i have to go tomorrow in fact , because in three weeks , to <unk> june , from <unk> , from <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm going to give you tomorrow in the rain .
so who wants to go , <unk> , tomorrow 's day , in the <unk> , i 'm going to <unk> all a thank you .
i 've got to say , briefly , i 'm going to trust the subject .
and i started , you know , extra , with the subject .
do n't worry about the nice , little <unk> , the blind and the blind , '' <unk> afterwards .
i was done before i made a little bit of thinking about how i 'm <unk> , how i 'm going to see how i 'm looking at ?
so , i come from a half houses , with six houses , many <unk> , a few <unk> , and in my parents on the farm , there 's apple apples and <unk> -- and what you do out of <unk> .
trust , in sports , of course , not in the <unk> , but <unk> and beer .
why do i tell the story where i am ?
for me , one of the most important stories that i 'm really so right , from the country , from the village and grew up with two great brothers , with the elders brother , the <unk> .
and with the second brother , the same is the blind way .
so , who looks a bright and dark , who can see where the <unk> window in the room , whether it 's light or out .
so what 's very practical is for the <unk> .
the , or we can both see when we have something like something .
<unk> <unk> , but i always say , `` i ca n't tell you , is <unk> <unk> .
for the subject of the old men , <unk> .
and it 's always going to come up .
and what 's really important to me , but what was really important , of course , is the fact , the fact , is the fact , and you 've got to trust this great trust , which is all the great trust , which is that we need to have a lot of <unk> , i 'll tell you .
and i mean , it was definitely my parents that you know , like many of you , my brother , and i had no blind .
so we were so the first , which are actually a very first of the lives in your life .
and then they had to do from the situation .
and now i 'm going to say , it 's a lot of happiness that my parents had to have all the whole day , and to lead us back to us , and say , there 's a wall , there 's the <unk> wall , and then you can feel like you can feel like you , and you can feel like you can feel like you .
a would have been uncomfortable -- we have fallen on home .
and b <unk> , our parents from us to go to the beginning to go and then , in the way of the <unk> brother .
so , in the house alone , the <unk> and <unk> .
there 's the blind brother i put in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> the <unk> , i still have this .
so this is the great brothers -- they 're not just good for the elbow and the <unk> .
and our brothers and my brothers and my brothers , and i was so excited to be <unk> in the <unk> farm , which is what we could do , for example , in the <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> brother began with three years , and then we wanted to have , michael and i .
and then we started to drive with <unk> , like many little kids , today , the <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
until the <unk> .
but we 've started that with <unk> , at some time .
and then the big question is : how does the act ?
and how do you do that , one of the faith , the faith of parents , that the kids are also going to fall back in the bike , and they 're going to <unk> the trust and the other side of us and the trust of us , and the trust of us that we do n't be permanently .
and our answer was , of course , of course , of course , is that we have an <unk> of our parents , where are the <unk> , which is a car , so where <unk> <unk> , where there 's no <unk> things , which are not going to be done -- and so we knew that
and we had to employ in between in between in between the way , but the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the other people are also listening to .
and that 's why you ca n't have a test here now , because it 's going to be a <unk> that you do n't know anything .
but <unk> ' night , when you 're going to light up , and in your bedroom , and in whose bedroom , then they wanted to be able to orient .
and you can try to cross the tongue with the tongue with the tongue , and they 're going to find that , in us , they 're just like bats -- they 'll hear a resistance .
so as bats are so <unk> that they 're going to hear , now , <unk> wall , <unk> <unk> , because the sound is going to be different .
and that 's for me to trust me , so , in the movement , the movement has always been important .
but the <unk> of the high school , and the security is , i have to help me to help me to help me .
and i just like to manage to manage a lot of trouble and clear , even without a lot of accidents , of course , of course , of course .
now , what i 'm not doing now , i 'm not doing some images now , which is that i 'm very <unk> , from a one of our <unk> .
and that 's the end of the ocean on our higher building on the higher building on a <unk> .
and i wrote a title , and i grew up to a <unk> increase .
and i 've been very literally because i was as a person who has a person who had a lot of and in the <unk> and in the <unk> in the scientific side , and in the <unk> in the scientific side , in the scientific side , i 've never had a deal with a thing , or i never have never seen this remarkable how i 've ever met .
i 've never read the same time in the same .
but i 've also have to do that , of course , of course , there 's no one of all of all of them have not lived in that exact way .
diversity is in the figure of the ability of our strength with the <unk> , to know where i am good , what i 'm doing , which i 'm doing , which i 'm doing , and where can i mean , really , really , very deeply <unk> ?
and our brother only again , who has michael and me and me along the house .
so then , then , okay , we <unk> a <unk> .
there you can be somewhere else , and you know , the <unk> window from the <unk> .
and the <unk> was then <unk> , michael and i 've got a little bit more like the girl 's girl : <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but in the end , who is going to end up ?
so i do n't .
and i think the other people , we 're the generation of young women , too .
and of course , i 'm still going to go .
and then , the consequence was that we were at all three <unk> <unk> in the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top , and the dad would be <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and i did n't know what to say .
because , of course , is , of course , is , of course , if other details .
so the father would have said to be , to god , help help help help be a lot of the danger of us have been a fear of us , have been a fear of us , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't know .
but is never happening .
and he had to be <unk> that he had just slowly <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , who has come up .
and that 's what i was very great that we had these opportunities .
but yeah , no concern is not a requirement , no effective , to make a <unk> .
for me , the different sports , who were important in my life , all , is interesting .
and all of all , they were all <unk> , because i could see , where did my boundaries , what are my <unk> .
so to <unk> good <unk> , i could never be able to be .
i never had the <unk> .
and i 'm not going to go to you in <unk> .
i 'm going to go out to rain .
now , not at five level , the moment .
and in <unk> rain -- but still rather than inside .
but i 've always been able to believe that to trust me in my open , and i discovered that i tried to try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try to try .
first , for example , <unk> .
and that was very beautiful , because the coach , there was a <unk> who had in the <unk> , said , ok , we 've got louder children , but send back to the <unk> of the blind children .
well , i 'm all right now , because you 're playing with each other , you 're going to get to the coats .
and then you realize what the other power is .
and there 's my big trust , of course , if i 'm going to be a long time , it 's hard to be difficult , but then the other might make what i do n't do .
so there 's a way , and that 's the trust in my speed .
and the other hand put a foot in the <unk> , let me go backwards itself .
i 'm not going to try and try it .
i was thinking about it , but i had <unk> .
i think that 's now a little bit more boring .
and that 's not a volunteer , right ?
<unk> .
crap , i 'm sure .
okay .
the next thing for me was important as a sports kid , and then , the <unk> and the <unk> .
my parents were home or home to today , and they 're taught all of these days and have taught us as children .
but for me , in school , i think , in school , how can i get a lot of school in order to get my excess energy ?
and there was a way i had a way to make a way in school .
and even i 've always thought , this is all <unk> boring , because it 's rather than the <unk> , i 'm going to be <unk> .
i found that in the way , i do n't have more .
i 've got to have said , well , i do with <unk> .
and then , the first thing , you 've realized , man , again , this is the great diversity of the sport , because you need <unk> , you need to make a good good talk ,
<unk> -- you probably have a lot of your work ?
this is what it 's in the <unk> .
you 'll just get a little bit quickly , if you have the full trust in your own technology .
if you have the trust in the own power -- so the power , you also have the same conditions , the bad weather , the soft snow .
and when you do it in my case in the team .
because of the <unk> , which is nothing of <unk> <unk> .
and i 've never been never done something like this , and i 've got to use the word -- my <unk> -- there 's only one -- i 've done my exercise .
but nothing , we do it again .
now , i 'm just going to be a little bit of you now .
and with one , one of you , one of them later , one of a exercise .
so what i do is to do with the topic of trust , which is the exercise i 'm going to give you the audience just like the audience just like it is like it , if you do n't see anything to make a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , you have two sticks in the hand .
so , from all , i ca n't give you hand , and i could take my dutch <unk> , and themselves , the <unk> <unk> .
do n't .
so i need to help me .
i then put my <unk> in front of me .
and the message is telling me the voice .
so , the same thing is , you have to do things like this .
and that 's also important for trust .
the obvious thing in communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> says i 'm always telling me , when it 's <unk> , '' which says `` <unk> , '' that says , `` the left on the left , i know it 's easy to the left .
when he says , on the left on the left , on the left , and when he says , on the right .
okay , everybody understood ?
and then <unk> problem , because i need to do again , and then i need to do it , or he has to correct me , then i know , `` well , what 's wrong . ''
and for me , it 's very big , most important , if the <unk> in front of me , i have to really have to really get to the really <unk> in order to say .
to say , he 's positive , and it 's for me to me the tools that it allows me to be , and then it 's very quickly , and also in the <unk> of the <unk> , the same competition .
and that can only do when i 'm going to do it , with two poor , to stand up , and i have to make a look at the way to make the eyes -- <unk> -- or ca n't open up .
and then you have to do this , and then you have to go to the other leg and just like that , and you can get a little bit more balance , but has to be quite quiet .
also , high .
yes , and that 's the key idea of me , when i 'm going to say , you know , how to say , i 'm just saying , `` oh , i 've just say , `` oh , i 've just say , `` hey , you know , `` hey , you know , you know , `` you do n't have to say , `` hey , you 've got to make the right <unk> , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because the
so i do n't know what to tell me .
so i 'm the one that 's going to open up the path to communication .
and this is like in each <unk> .
if someone does n't know my needs , of course , of course , he ca n't help me , but i have to say , well , i need to say , `` well , i need to win from you from you the curve earlier . ''
or i need to have a practice of you like the <unk> , you know , the mountain is still , because if we 're going to get the <unk> <unk> , there 's what you have to be .
and again , again , it 's just <unk> and the thing is not listening to .
and then i also have a little bit of the pilot , which is the pilot 's <unk> , on <unk> <unk> , who i told me , unfortunately , we decided to have a few minutes ago , and so we needed to <unk> , so we 're going to <unk> a little bit , and then it 's a little bit of
so that 's why it 's important to have the idea of <unk> <unk> .
i 'm listening to <unk> -- here is another thing that are <unk> <unk> ?
who is more ?
so my best time has been faster , but it was in september , and now , in april , i did n't have to be honest as much faster than <unk> .
and in the moment of the moment , <unk> .
and for me , as i said , these are the kind of <unk> , only if i just get my ears .
but the other one i 'm telling me what he looks like to see , and i 'm like that way , my risks is perfect .
and that 's one of the most important things that i say , `` trust is rather , and not the <unk> <unk> .
so , even from the blind , it 's not as much as a blind , frankly , from the <unk> .
because i 've also had the experience that i had a <unk> on the right and on the left .
and then this was bad at the competition because it 's next to the way of three feet .
and i 'm the three yards just <unk> .
so , as i said , `` well , this was , of course , <unk> .
i also know , i also know , because the <unk> <unk> need to turn up , so you have to get <unk> .
and i 'm going to be able to be able to say that people say , people say , on the left , and say , `` oh , the other left .
so , then , there was the right , sadly .
it 's not a lot of life in the ground .
but yeah , in <unk> situation , you know , you probably know all of the work of work or the university as well as it has to go .
then , of course , of course , obviously , often <unk> difficult challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` i mean , <unk> trust is trust i need to know the risks .
and i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to be honest , i 'm like someone who ca n't see , relatively big in the advantage , because i 'm betting my risks in many ways .
so i 'm going to <unk> all of the <unk> .
and from driving tree , from the fall , from falling down , which i know , but of course , i know , but of course , and i 'm <unk> , and that 's the important thing -- but i also <unk> the good pages .
and then you can get there , if that 's the trust , you know .
and if you 've found somebody , which is really a hundred percent of how i need it .
and with all , i have the same goals .
because this is in the subject of me , the next thing is , very important .
you need the same goal , and i need to see what 's going to be really , just trust ?
because it 's often <unk> faster , which you use .
i trust it or the or myself .
but that 's what it 's really important is that it 's too much .
you know that you do n't have a lot of trust for trust .
and that you also -- because we 're going to meet people with <unk> <unk> -- we want to see <unk> sense .
and the sense of the sense that is very often that we 're also able to achieve <unk> goal together .
that 's where we do it -- for example , from some , weeks , i 've gone on the <unk> .
and i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , you know , i 'm just saying , i have to look at anybody to be looking for , or i can trust that in the case , that i 'm just going to get this mountain on top .
and how do you do that in the mountain in the end , you know ?
now , yeah , i had one advantage of the advantage , i did n't see some things , if it 's next to me to be a hundred yards .
and then i was relatively <unk> .
can be an advantage of advantage , fear is not a problem .
and i 've been working with fear of fear and i 've been working with fear of the <unk> , and then i ran out of the <unk> , and then i ran out of <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
now , this is a little bit more <unk> , when you look at the bottom and down the cars , you do n't need to see a lot of a lot to see there , it 's going to hurt if i 'm <unk> .
and these things are always interesting for me .
but you know , also , also , the <unk> of the <unk> , but you know , you know , `` hey , i think it 's the war on the way , i think i 'm looking at all of it , and you can just have a new new new experience .
and that 's a little bit of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , because at <unk> mountain , you go to the day , you 're just 10 hours , and it 's just a little bit more .
and you 're going to go , and it 's just stones around you , still less plants .
you take a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and you 've got a first time in front of the world .
so if you look at <unk> de <unk> , the <unk> of the last , the <unk> .
this is how the only exciting thing .
we 've seen the messages away from the distance or the other .
so , of course , i 've got a lot of trust in the <unk> -- despite the <unk> <unk> that he had .
because i thought , well , well , well , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
but as i said , it 's otherwise quite <unk> , because you 're not going to be a lot of change now .
and really exciting is , then it 's going to be , if you get something hard .
so when you go to the height and the air is thinner .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , when you have <unk> little <unk> , where it 's on the left and on the right .
and then , it 's too beautiful and when it 's still night , and all of the <unk> , and then at the <unk> , and then he 'd say , `` now , he would like me to get the rope around and then have me in the handle .
because i was like , as a single one without <unk> , and then it was too risky too .
and i 've created that , we 've been able to say , `` well , i mean , of course , my mother , my friend , my friend , my friend , i think , a hundred percent of trust , and we 've got this before .
but i also need to make a <unk> form of security , so i do n't need to focus because , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you imagine , if you 're going to tell you , you know , if you 're going to tell you to the mountain , you 're going to say that in the mountain , you know , `` the right on the right on the right on the right on the right , on the left on the left on the left on the left on the left on the left on the right .
there 's where you 're going to <unk> , and that 's all of them .
so for us , in the case , we 've been trust in the case , we 're looking for <unk> connection , so , so we got a rope on your backpack , which had me in the hand , and then i ran out behind her , and then
in the other <unk> , i was also <unk> that i had a little bit of the <unk> .
and she 's just going to end up with the foot on the foot , and it 's <unk> with her <unk> <unk> , that i just knew what to be in the same way , and i did n't want to focus on me .
and what i 've shown all of the whole thing is , how beautiful it 's actually , of course , you see , of course , when you look at the top of it , you 'll get up with the top of that target , you know , like the <unk> .
but in the other hand , it 's also that i realized that trust is that i 've got to me , that is the case that 's the most important thing i 've got to have the top of the top .
but it 's the trust is also in other people , the <unk> , how trust it works .
and when we 're <unk> at night , we were in the group , we were in the group , and there 's the rest of us , and there were the other seven students and the rest of us had come from us , and i 've got to get a break behind us and i thought , `` well , and tell you , and tell you , and tell you , and tell you , why you can look at the way , and tell me , why you can look at this , and
you ca n't look at the boys in the back .
this is kind of not the reason .
and then i realized , ah , yeah , yeah , the trust , which is also quite <unk> .
you 're going to go through the dark , you go to 12 o'clock at 12 o'clock , there 's no light .
this is completely <unk> , when you 're <unk> , the air is a thin , so it 's just a little bit more and so far as well .
and then there 's the moment where the wait for you have said , `` yes , that was actually completely <unk> , because the friend 's friend of mine has been on me , we 've got constantly <unk> -- how the women are going to do .
have the whole night we told us , and the other people in the group had exactly something like this , and there was just the luxury of the confirmation , ok , ok , it 's just <unk> hour , which is told me .
or i did n't tell you what the mountain is told .
and that 's what you know , it 's still somebody who might not be bad at about it , maybe we 've just talked about it , and it 's just more than the sun goes on .
and that things that you see , this is also the same thing that can be able to trust itself , and can not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and for me , all of all , is that trust is , and then , all of all , is all right , if you 're so personal gold , and what you want to do , and what are really going to be in the idea right now .
this is , of course , in sports , you know , the gold , in the sport , i do n't know why the teacher does n't do -- maybe i do n't know , to test value or looking at the value of the value ?
so , i think , some of these are , it 's so hard to find out of this six times .
if that would be real gold , i 'm not here , then i would be on the <unk> .
or at least , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i think the real thing , why you do that , is more , you know , what i 'm actually created is , and how did i build my skills and forces on a point .
so how did i have in my skills , but of course of the team that we all need , whether in the study , in what else .
anyway , old man or young woman , we need people too , too .
and then , if we have this aim in the head , and then there 's the best proof of evidence that we could trust in a project in our lives .
and when you can be , it can be honest in other areas .
thank you very much .
one science for me , this is the title of my talk , which led to <unk> of her beautiful maps .
what i 'm looking for me is the very <unk> effort that <unk> the sciences as a <unk> in the general population .
in fact , i could be content .
when i put in a <unk> <unk> , there 's all <unk> to the literature for scientific topics , which is <unk> .
even each other <unk> , there 's a range of <unk> <unk> , magazines , <unk> , where scientific themes , <unk> themes , kind of different things .
everybody 's called at least a <unk> , where kind of scientific themes are processing .
even , this is completely <unk> when you look at what it is in magazines and <unk> for children with scientific subjects .
and every program has already sort of an easier foot in the <unk> , but yet that 's a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that i want to see , i 'd like to look at that , but i want to read , but that 's not what that 's not true .
cool , cool is just a sort of cool in <unk> , in <unk> , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
in <unk> , a <unk> five minutes , has nothing with the reality , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there 's where i can identify .
big bang <unk> , because i can laugh in it , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
this is extremely sad .
because that 's kind of paradox , which is a little paradox that are going to be in the future , and we can just deal with these problems of technology and issues .
but at the same time , no one of them did n't in oneself .
i 've got a few little bit of little examples of how science or science is just a place .
a very <unk> example : in london , you built a beautiful tower , <unk> , the architect , the architect , we 're just building this kind of <unk> .
what happens is what happens is now , the sunlight of the top of the facade , is that the sunlight of the facade , i got <unk> <unk> , focused on the other side of a point .
that was a big deal by the press , unfortunately , unfortunately , a coral .
so the heat , the heat has so <unk> that poor poor , who has really long , long , there are the <unk> path .
there is a architect , a architect , who did n't have a little bit like this in physics because i mean , is completely new , that 's a mirror .
so what i found is , quite new , is <unk> in front of the <unk> christ , where he used to detect a fleet of <unk> .
so , i really wonder what has the more design or architect or what did he studied ?
this is a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is how to create such a <unk> , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , this is now a few years ago , as a sort of thing that 's been in the media .
there was the train in <unk> , because <unk> changed , it was a danger .
genes was <unk> with green <unk> .
genes were kind of bad .
<unk> , oh , there are genes inside .
there were situations where there was in the market , there was actually a lot of farmers , hey , i have <unk> vegetables .
no idea what 's supposed to be , yes .
so , yeah , okay , the german tomatoes , we have to discuss it .
but the time i was in the lab , and i was really <unk> , because i tried to get these evil genes in my bacteria , this <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my <unk> neighbor : <unk> , you do n't see happy , but not happy , what 's going on ?
i mean , yeah , i 'm going to try and make a little gene in the same gene in my bacteria and do n't work .
now , this was what i 've tried to explain , so somehow a <unk> , genes , yeah , i thought , good lady , if i talk about genes , you 've already know what she means .
and that was what i really meant , so one sequence that i wanted to get in these <unk> <unk> .
but that was what the woman has gone .
this woman never came back to me .
who knows what i 'm going to <unk> , <unk> ?
genes are bad .
now , this is good 10 years ago , and yet it 's kind of in consciousness .
genes that 's bad .
i 'm not just read a long time .
and there 's a <unk> technology , but it 's actually made a language .
<unk> would be in europe , was a headline .
there 's a different component of other corn , which contains no genes in all .
another headline , <unk> , <unk> rats are dying earlier .
yes , that was a beautiful headline .
but these are not so old , and it 's also not even more anyway , what are i available .
anyway , whether the time or the picture , all about <unk> .
luckily , it 's still not going to be <unk> in the <unk> , but i 'm afraid that 's not a long time .
but that just showing what uncertainty is in the population , because they 're just not in the issues .
we have to be interested in our future with these technologies .
now , just <unk> , no one had the big on the subject , but it 's going to be over things , and they 've been elected , and i 've got a real idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
how is that information from the lab ?
if we suppose that little , young , young scientists , a experiment , a experiment , a experiment , <unk> something , beautiful and good , and he 's going to be good ,
then the first thing to go to the professor .
the boss , who decides , you do n't want to say okay , okay , cool subject , your name is on the name of the <unk> , which is always important in science , <unk> .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public , it 's a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> thought , oh , great idea , class , there 's a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a <unk> with a project , a nice idea , and then that comes from the <unk> .
so that 's going to be <unk> , yeah , but who 's actually ?
now these studies are rarely alone , typically , have a shared <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all of these , the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the right <unk> projects , then you get over the <unk> , whether it 's <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
that 's the way .
from the basis , it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the ground in order to the really , very cool experiments , which really put in these <unk> projects .
these are good at <unk> , who are really good , there 's <unk> , yes , yes , yes , but who will i get to ?
it 's basically the ones who are interested in .
in the <unk> , we are always called the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , the <unk> are interested in , which is the <unk> , yes , beautiful and good .
nice magazine , reached the audience who are interested in , and perhaps perhaps have a idea where <unk> comes in this article .
who 's the <unk> i really do ?
the <unk> who are interested in .
the <unk> , that was now yes , the <unk> <unk> , i call him mr. <unk> <unk> , who read it under circumstances of circumstances , i tried to say it 's not to be neutral .
and yet , again , our future are going to be the way we can be able to find ourselves with these <unk> .
fracking , <unk> , renewable energy , <unk> , these are all things that are <unk> , but not really understand the <unk> and not really understand .
my project , my idea is , so , i mean , are different , these little , young , young , young scientists out of the <unk> , very completely totally completely totally completely <unk> , and to make it be able to restore science .
so what 's mostly happened is that a scientist , i 've got a buddy , we know , for good two years , he 's <unk> , it 's a <unk> rule , it 's not to ask him to the job .
as soon as he said , and he tells the mouth , and he tells us about his job .
<unk> , these are scientists who tell you what about a <unk> .
<unk> , sounds like this , <unk> , <unk> , it 's already almost as well as genes .
it 's treated , it 's kind of a little bit , oh , you do n't know what 's behind .
and the real time , you know , you know , again , this is nice and good , if you 're on a conference , and you know , your people , your <unk> , you want to tell you from <unk> something , but you know , `` <unk> , ''
where is the problem really <unk> and normal ?
so i school , this is my idea , these young scientist who are not so far in the hierarchy , which is a little bit of malleable to school , how to make up .
this is a use of all , <unk> , but anyway , investors who want to see what happens in the <unk> .
and finally , the name of the tax tax , who are being used to be used to be used to communicate the <unk> .
but the training , this is just one story .
i also want to put you a jury , and i want to give you a jury , and you want to introduce her project , you know , the project of a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , even worse , it 's not : kids .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if this is real , of albert einstein : if you ca n't explain , then you did n't really understand it .
so , the scientists of the lab , and you think about how to begin to think how can i really communicate that really normal .
so , there 's a lot of stories .
now , <unk> are totally modern , in each university , common , but also , i 'll get the <unk> .
who is the <unk> of the end of the city in the university of the city in the university of the city at some <unk> , going to <unk> a talk to <unk> in the university ?
these are the ones that are anyway .
i got my <unk> .
so , these are the people who are interested in for that , who are going to listen to there and hear two talks .
that 's nice , there 's a <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> are all , all are happy , and it 's it .
so i 'm going to put in a second one point , say it 's not there in this <unk> project .
these scientists are still immune , how <unk> are kids ?
because a lot of really <unk> have to reduce the substance .
because scientists , like the research , and how kids are exploring their world , are identical .
children are very sophisticated .
they do something like that .
you try to try and make it work ?
`` <unk> , fall , no way , we do n't work , the next piece , i change a few parameters .
kids learn very sophisticated .
these are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i 'm <unk> , what happens , what happens i need to change , or not .
this is normal !
but that 's a lot of <unk> .
and of course , i think that 's really , if you get the <unk> , and these scientists in the neighborhood where the environment are in school , from school in school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , because i 'm really engaged in the <unk> , and i believe in the world , because the kids are actually
and then you might have , maybe at some point , this is my hope , telling me the kids , and then i get to mr. <unk> , who also talk to scientific topics , because children 's kids
so this is not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere in galileo , but his kids tell him something that it has a bread with a <unk> <unk> , that it has a bread in a <unk> , and then it 's also a bread , and then also , then it 's also <unk> a house like a architect .
and not only get to me , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , <unk> , but also the <unk> .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just about that , the first <unk> , said , `` yes , '' said , `` well , <unk> for our scientists , '' that 's not right now , which is not right now .
a scientist must not communicate .
yeah , i think , okay , i 'm going to be called the next one .
but who 's kind of work in a department , <unk> is in a company , which is the next break .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
you ca n't have a day .
the last few weeks , were awful .
the weather has made us a big line of the bill .
seven , seven years ago , eight years , i was asked if i 'd like to take this .
i was in <unk> , nearly 10 years , at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and in <unk> .
we 've got right there to be there .
they had <unk> <unk> .
and for me , this was actually , well , that 's what it 's <unk> .
what is that ?
<unk> , this is actually ridiculous .
but i have learned that one of the things , and that 's why i 'm here today .
and maybe it might be a little bit crazy , but it 's too emotionally .
it 's beautiful and it 's exciting and it 's great fun .
and i 'm going to talk to you in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes , a little bit of this life .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
the company has been done for a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company has been in two years .
and the <unk> of the <unk> .
the company has been over about <unk> or <unk> years .
the <unk> is the zeppelin here .
marcus .
one image i want to show you here , which is a little point of right , which is actually a red , so a <unk> in a <unk> , right , that point is too big .
there 's the world 's largest <unk> .
and it 's actually just 10 active .
that 's what you see .
there 's about six thousand active active active active active .
so that 's actually not a market .
it 's not even a unique .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also : why do you do that ?
how does that go ?
<unk> in the insisted , and only 10 , there 's another thing to talk about why this is so .
quite a short story .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
very quick .
has fallen to 14 14 in the first world war in the world .
and then in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died , by the way , by <unk> and <unk> , have been built by <unk> .
and then , the <unk> was bombed and so on and so forth .
and when we 've got <unk> and eight to london , and with a big <unk> , there 's a <unk> project , the english campaign were filled with the `` the headline , '' and i 'm not going to be with five dollars .
so the story has been in the story .
and we had a wrong campaign .
but <unk> , the customer was n't so much , because all of the sudden , it 's going to see what there was there , which had the old memories in there .
and you know , it was a little bit more critical .
but in london , there was a good campaign in london except the weather in the north , many years ago , many years ago , many years ago , very much and very <unk> .
and we 're not a lot .
and then , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and one of the <unk> did that come to america .
this has a myth that has fallen in the entire german nation , which is a little bit of felt as a <unk> and <unk> .
there was in new york , with <unk> .
and the whole german nation has gone down , we 're back who are .
this is in all the <unk> , and that 's really what 's explain to this is a little bit of this device .
but actually , until <unk> and <unk> , only five , six , seven , seven , seven , <unk> were built , and actually just two right , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> that have <unk> the passengers .
passengers , hundred , where about <unk> passengers and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> in the time , the first live vehicle was <unk> , unfortunately , unfortunately .
next to the titanic , where one looks like a icon , a product , and then it 's never going to get back .
the other way were also hired .
and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> the last time .
the materials are used to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it was nothing about <unk> years .
and then had the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the zeppelin who had the idea , maybe you should begin to begin .
and i became <unk> <unk> , because you 've developed a great product , which is we going to get to the market .
yes , is he a market ?
what is there in ?
so .
now we 're talking about it .
the <unk> <unk> , that might be short to explain , and i 'm <unk> , yes , <unk> , people have done a lot .
there are a lot of firms that ran out of this <unk> .
there are <unk> employees , about six billion dollars .
this is a real economy , for <unk> .
there 's a lot of behind .
and there 's also convinced me here .
the zeppelin is actually a regular plane like each other airplane , but did n't , sorry , <unk> <unk> , helium , alcohol , and <unk> also a <unk> .
is like a whale that 's on the water , and you have a lot of <unk> , and there 's a lot of <unk> .
now , the time now is n't there tonight in detail .
inside , a zeppelin looks like a structure .
there 's two kinds of <unk> .
there are <unk> <unk> , which are we , <unk> in the case and <unk> .
there 's no fabric , and they are like <unk> in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , which are built in the world , four , <unk> piece .
and there 's only one of the things i said earlier , just <unk> in the insisted of our own insisted , so just over , just 20 .
that 's how the production is going to be brought up when a bone is <unk> .
on the left , the structure again .
and the bone is also <unk> .
come from the <unk> .
<unk> : the astronauts of the astronauts .
and then there were the origins there are origins .
one point is , one point of two million dollars as a bone .
and it has to be <unk> , and it has to be <unk> , because it has to be <unk> , because you have to see , and over again , you have to see when it 's a little bit of it , or a hole that is not going on .
and there 's the <unk> , and they 're looking at <unk> and see if you 're going to be in holes .
and the end of the end is a <unk> without the south korea is like this .
so the zeppelin is technically a <unk> product .
and this looks at the bottom here , very quickly .
one point nine percent , one point of a point nine percent , one point of six percent <unk> , which is called a thousand thousand to about 10 thousand <unk> .
this is very little and very good .
this is a <unk> .
it can see .
but there 's another trend that 's been involved in the moment , and i have shown here at the top .
we had three years ago , three years ago , when i started <unk> five , eight years ago , eight years ago , <unk> percent , and last year ago .
and this year in may , we were at <unk> percent .
if you 're the eight years , my eight years , with <unk> and <unk> of it , you know , at least , in these eight years , of course , one <unk> of the eight years , of course , in this eight years , the five years of
we are <unk> .
we ca n't get passengers through fog .
you want to see something .
and the <unk> or <unk> are already going to be launched every year .
so a little picture of the weather is that our weather does n't just felt like , but statistically , because we do weather every day .
but because this is so good , the <unk> has a program <unk> <unk> , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i 'm going to come from finland today .
the <unk> is connecting here is a flying lab .
<unk> is called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the earth and <unk> feet .
it 's called <unk> .
and the zeppelin t flies from italy to <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
a lot of many hundred dollars of <unk> and analyze the air in the air , how they 're in the air .
there 's what i 'm going to explain , there 's the second <unk> .
a great assignment .
and is when you want to be able to make a sense of <unk> in the subject .
so this is very good .
and here 's a couple of <unk> .
the <unk> about sweden was last week or <unk> week .
and in finland , by the way the weather is great , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> are saying that they had never had .
i 've got there just wonderful , nice warm days .
they do n't have the mosquitos too bad .
we were also in africa .
and have been looking for de <unk> <unk> , used to be <unk> volcanoes that are gone from millions of years .
just you can ask , you know , you can ask , this is all africa , if you ask yourself , then you ask yourself , after a idea of questions , it 's a sense of questions , it 's a sense of questions , it 's the idea of meaning in the cinema at the movie , the movie was going to be <unk> in the movie ,
i wondered , well , what do we do ?
and what do we have to support that ?
and at the end , we were going to have been completed .
and the <unk> did n't go on .
the whole <unk> came out at the time , and then the project was stopped .
and a tornado had the zeppelin at the mast in the mast that he could be in the bottom .
but was n't so bad .
we had a good job , and they were actually quite happy .
and that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what i should do .
yes , what we do today is a very quick <unk> of the <unk> .
what we 're doing is , it 's about it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or insisted .
what we 're doing today is the <unk> in <unk> here .
we do <unk> .
we have to get the zeppelin and get it .
<unk> is called aging .
there are still a little bit of devices in the way to 10 , we 've got to be replaced with each other .
we 're just replacing the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there 's the clients who are talking about it , we talk about .
we have to do the <unk> all the time .
we 're a <unk> <unk> business who are controlled by the german <unk> and the european boundaries , and all the time , with <unk> or <unk> like <unk> .
this is also <unk> and costs money , and it 's going to be still going to get up .
the question is , does you go ?
do you want to develop ?
do you make bigger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what do you do ?
you continue to go in the market ?
is you going to continue ?
and that 's what we have to try and even miss it .
and there are some <unk> <unk> .
and by the way , the <unk> <unk> ran a few <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
at the beginning , on the <unk> , there was the <unk> of <unk> .
the german population has saved him in the end of six million <unk> , when the fourth <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he was basically broke the population of a donation .
and from the <unk> <unk> , and the other companies came out , and we do n't have <unk> or <unk> , and i 'm not going to do n't here today , and other companies would be there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and they were listening to san francisco with a customer .
there was a very <unk> <unk> .
both projects are sadly .
so <unk> .
at the same time , we won <unk> .
there 's no picture that i ca n't show up because we could n't show the <unk> .
but in america , now , the first <unk> of the first <unk> are going to be done .
we sold three piece .
and with <unk> , we 're developing a partner in a partner also a technology .
and that 's a big success , but at the same time , the defeat .
two customers are basically <unk> , because it did n't go .
why did n't it ?
we actually know .
either was n't the place where the place had not the right or the passengers had to have to <unk> , or in america , in america , you know how you knew the last 30 attack of years to provide advertising ?
the <unk> people have <unk> , you 've seen the <unk> , have said , `` <unk> , again , the power of advertising .
there is no idea that you did n't know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
and it was actually twice the marketing in marketing : hey , people is called and flies .
<unk> .
the pilot has to transport the year , and they 've got to put them <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year , we 've only have <unk> satellites from weather .
there 's a lot of a million .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin is <unk> <unk> routes .
and it 's the sense of course , of course , of course , when i look like a student like the passengers , and they laugh , and we 're not going to do an advertising , because it 's about <unk> and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the <unk> , and i do it so beautiful , and they do it so much , and who 's still going to continue to be so much more and who 's still going to continue to
and we were great <unk> .
so i always got to open up with the <unk> with the mistake that you think we 're <unk> .
you could still do it still .
we 've got a <unk> on the <unk> and we 're <unk> .
in fact , it 's not true .
we 're also making advertising .
this is a science project , the <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> did this done with the island of <unk> .
but the <unk> community is a difficult market .
and you even have to make the <unk> <unk> : power is still making sense ?
we actually have enough commercials , but the internet has a lot of change that <unk> over the launch , because the <unk> control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there 's just 10 to the world .
we have three .
two active , one of the <unk> , the <unk> , three , you bought it , 10 are active .
so , six of 10 .
that 's what we 're going to do is actually , when it 's actually , if it 's actually a control .
and hope , again , again , again .
and the conclusion david <unk> , commander of the apollo of apollo <unk> , after his <unk> paris , and five , he said , `` the walk on the <unk> .
so it 's beautiful .
now , advertising is too nice , too .
just do n't find the customers .
now , we 're going to find a <unk> value , a technological value .
there are we customers .
it 's not .
it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> .
this is how a <unk> can need to be a <unk> .
and then there is no years .
there 's also funny effect that are easy to control and be hard to control .
in each case , this is the situation , <unk> , a point in the world market , so it 's not a market .
but we continue .
it 's a icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to make it .
you just do the question : what form we do ?
how much money we have in the world ?
what do we do for here ?
what kind of shape is going to do that ?
and i personally , they were asked to say something personal , i am , of course , of my flock of <unk> , where i wanted to be <unk> in the big <unk> , also , <unk> , it 's also going to go and go to rescue .
i was also <unk> in greenpeace three years , when i 've seen from vancouver island , and i 've seen this whole <unk> jungle , which i made me there .
and then there was a <unk> of greenpeace that are <unk> , who are <unk> of the money , and not know what they should have to do , and it 's basically gone .
and there 's what you 've done me to do that .
and i 've been <unk> in three years as a <unk> , and now i 'm doing this in hope , a long future in the zeppelin .
zero , right ? forty seconds , i 'm done , thank you .
morton bast
yes , thank you .
these are my three points that i 'd like to talk to the <unk> minutes .
why are we in the abundance of the abundance or abundance ?
how do we get to a <unk> ?
and mostly , what do n't ?
what 's what about it is ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a little bit <unk> .
but it 's also to show the challenges .
a few years ago , this is more difficult to explain .
that we have a problem today , every child .
that 's the problem .
but again , it 's already worth that , which is the challenges of the population growth rate .
all kinds of <unk> are exponential .
when you see it in a historic long way , the way the way of the body is going to be a very short answer in history .
in the moment , we ca n't imagine that it 's kind of different from the way it 's going to go on .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some of them say , well , there were some of the last <unk> years .
and you can also look at <unk> , i 'm also right .
you can also say , who needs to be <unk> ?
you can also say it 's far away .
but it 's now , if you get a little bit more part of the way to make a real challenges , things that are really to avoid things , otherwise we just have trouble in the <unk> of the <unk> .
it 's called the day of time over 30 months .
and there 's degree in our cities like in vienna or in vienna , and in <unk> , and they 're always going to continue all right .
but it 's also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas where the great streams is , and the <unk> of this is depending on the himalayas to the himalayas .
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is the <unk> of what we do , there was a lot larger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about the people who are actually going to be actually <unk> in a change system .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts spread out .
the bay is less .
this is the aral sea , where a fundamental part of our cotton .
and that 's all that comes from ?
all of the bad things , tell you , you know , hang in one or another form with the global <unk> .
with what we get from the entire earth , which we harvest .
not only , the oil and the minerals and minerals , but also the renewables are renewable resources , but over the end of all .
and we 're looking at just looking at so little as possible to produce less <unk> and emissions .
so , it 's about the <unk> in order to be used to reduce the entire <unk> .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not only c , two , <unk> of a car , and really live in life .
different .
our technology is completely new .
when we look back , the soviet union and famine , and there 's still on earth 's areas that live in principle in the bottom of a ton of resources in the year ,
in a <unk> , there was three of the human history of five tons .
today , there 's four to <unk> .
so , this is <unk> <unk> .
and he 's very , very <unk> distributed on earth .
it 's more than in north america , more than the earth is worth of the earth .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa very , very much less .
and that 's where we have <unk> the implications of us , the rivers , which is much better in the last decades , but it 's basically the most important in the last few decades , but it 's basically getting in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world are still going to be less .
and that 's why the conflicts we see from <unk> , is , afghanistan , where they look at the most of the american <unk> survey , and then you see where the resources are coming .
and that 's there it 's particularly colorful , there 's a lot of resources there , where the <unk> of the world are .
so if we want to make up with it , we have to have to have a whole thing .
so we need to change the ecological boundaries everywhere , the <unk> is all over .
and that 's what we have to live in <unk> life is not so much .
this is the mahatma gandhi , when he said , the world has enough to everybody 's needs , but not for everybody greed .
and there is how we live in the average life in the average .
so .
this was the kind of <unk> part .
but i always find that you need to need to understand the idea of understanding what it is .
even if i would say , it would be worth like that , which is a way to live more than that .
but it 's still , but over the <unk> <unk> , you need a rationale , say , `` tell you . ''
so , what is a <unk> ?
and there 's what we have to see in our rich parts of the world , there 's a lot of success , meaningful , meaningful physical bodies , living in living in living in the average of living in the average of the average of living in the average .
so here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people who are also telling people who ca n't deal with that story .
i wrote there .
and climate change is the same cause .
we work too much and heavy .
this is on the one side , we come from stress in stress , and there 's too much .
i also love very much .
and on the other hand , we 're going to get this <unk> .
what is a good life ?
how can we define that ?
now , this is a little bit of scientific science .
now , also , what i was saying , and what i 'm going to say , is that i 'm going to say a lot of religious , but this is the way it 's going to be in the way i think that 's the kind of thing i think about this ?
and there 's important to understand the quality of life has always been two things .
quality of quality of the objective conditions like me , what i 've got to eat .
i have a roof on the head ?
did i have friends ?
i mean , i mean , can i want to be involved in life ?
but just , how do i get myself around with it ?
i mean , i think that 's the perceived quality of life .
and then i 'm going to introduce two words that are important to the point .
one is needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human flourishing , of course , in order to make emotion .
if we can satisfy our needs , we are happy .
and needs you ca n't say , needs to be sustainable or unsustainable .
needs of se <unk> are not going to <unk> .
what are needs ?
you can quote from different scientists , i just have two called two .
and of course , of course , the physical needs , but also , need to have a need for social relationships .
after protection , from food , after <unk> , after creativity , after the <unk> .
this is a little bit of doing something with money .
but in a big part , but the question is , but the question is , is i channel that in my life .
and there 's the second important term .
strategies .
the strategy i 've got to do with me to have these needs .
and there 's a little bit , i 'm going to go to a high <unk> , or a low <unk> .
there i need a lot of money or a little bit .
and strategies are just my behavior like me to <unk> my needs .
and that has to do with my values , with the resources , with the capabilities that i have .
if i 'm a little bit of money , i 'm going to get some kind of going to try to satisfy my needs to satisfy when i have a lot of money in a lot of money .
it 's all about the <unk> , which is the roof of the head , and then it 's like the <unk> .
and there 's a little bit of right here , with a lot or little <unk> , which can be sustainable or <unk> .
and when we have the whole strategies that are available to me to satisfy my needs , then we talk about a lifestyle .
so .
this was the scientific <unk> .
and now , what 's now , what can we do now ?
how does it go ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
and of course , this is also to find each other for themselves .
but the evidence of the individual kind of kind of kind of a technical kind of technical , here 's the idea of science , and then finally , in a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
and the slides in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , the danger is , the danger is that we use more consumption and more resources more resources .
in the end of the quality of life , again , because the effects are always going to be worse , and they 're getting worse , , and we 're going to beat up .
or , whether we 're doing it , in a different direction , there are less than less consumption , but with a higher quality of quality of life .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe there 's a couple of things that 's <unk> in this subject , so more life quality of quality of life .
there 's a lot of technology , how i can use a single thing , which is every single thing we 're using here , the orange juice , the coffee , the traffic , how can i make it ?
cement , i can produce different , i can build the house from wood , etc. , etc .
to create less <unk> or the same quality of life .
my other teacher , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , which is what we 've been going to have to have a state of what 's already going to be a lot of in it .
where are the needs ?
what services can i do ?
and how can i do this with a little bit more precise ?
and there 's not a little bit less but <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's a lot of examples that have been able to do this .
in vienna , a tower is built in the tower with twenty <unk> .
with seven <unk> , it 's built in <unk> .
essentially , this is from wood .
and you might not need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
but it 's also a lot in our own , sort of , like , how <unk> i actually do ?
<unk> <unk> wrote a beautiful book , called <unk> .
where he shows how hard it is , in the end of this , really , from this treadmill .
the <unk> , i want to take a <unk> from the other , and then i am forever forever in this race .
you have a <unk> , and you know , i 've got a little bit quickly , and then i get the new .
i mean , the nicest <unk> , i know the <unk> , you all know .
when i started my institute , a few years ago , we wrote letters .
and then you 've got to wait for the letter , i 'm going to write a letter , i 'm serious <unk> .
for that , i write hundreds of email , i write hundreds of email .
and i can afford very much more .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we 're going to come back .
but i do n't really have a really time .
i did n't done a damn stranger for me .
but there 's good examples , slow food for example , for example , where i really kind of like the power of quality and the desire of the <unk> in the foreground .
and with a very low range of life .
one of my favorites is <unk> .
there 's 4,000 of these days , there 's a lot of average person in germany , austria about 10 things in the household .
you can also have the capacity .
who 's two , two , three generations of thousands of years ago , had been employees , surgery .
they have managed .
we have to deal with it .
and less people get clear with this whole options .
and we need a stick to give us with this a few things that are <unk> with these few things .
now , the idea of what i think is , perhaps , is perhaps a kind of model of the spaceship , which i think you can not find tens of thousands of things .
the next example is use instead of living .
a true boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> , might have been developed in alternative six years ago .
in the meantime , it 's still using more people when they think of <unk> .
when you think about <unk> .
<unk> , business models that are just working with how you 've done these beautiful <unk> , which has been built in a few hundred years ago , which has been able to use some of the other centuries of the end of the end .
and that 's what the first time was just better to use .
that 's also a question of justice .
i showed you earlier how <unk> that is as a picture between africa and europe and a whole world .
so , like all , all the same time with these resources can be able to be able to use , if we use it less .
and this is not less quality of quality , because many of us has been in a lot of us .
but it 's a important task of the economy , the companies , these products , these products we need to make a good life with a great country .
last point , this has something that has been to do with the big policy , which is the growth of the growth , i think i was .
if you find a little bit of attention , it 's a little bit of surprising , it 's <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , it 's going to be a little bit more in the bottom .
it 's called , yes , a crisis is in front of the door in front of my view , and also after what we 've been talking about with economists , and there are the numbers of austria , and they 're going to be the numbers of austria , and they 're just going to be a lot of growth in the bottom .
and there 's no reason to have growth again , as i know that , from my youth , from the <unk> years .
part of a mathematical reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth in america .
and eight percent is what china has .
these are roughly where we were coming from before .
by the whole , if the pies is bigger , of course , it 's more than eight percent <unk> .
one percent is still much , so we 're going to do so much .
but you have to hire a little bit , which is to hire that , not even if we had zero growth , that 's where we had zero growth , that 's what we have to make a lot of the year , and they consume this year .
so we can invest good , and we can work with it .
and that 's not so much like that , because you know these statistics , which is not going to be done in the growth of life .
the economy is growing , but the quality of life remains in the <unk> countries that we are .
and by the way , jobs are also possible without growth , and it 's not being tightly together , how it 's always going to be more <unk> and how they 're going to be called the hot note .
and it 's not just true , and then you have to get on the economy of economics .
and it 's still going to get more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than <unk> or next week , the way that i think , in the trend is a bigger story with this subject , <unk> .
already , edward <unk> , who was <unk> , <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , the good life , the good economy , the good economy , the good life .
now , this is the end of the end , and not primarily to create <unk> , not primarily about growth , which is not going to be in growth .
for <unk> and these countries , also for china , for india , there 's a serious story .
and that 's just as a result of the <unk> , when we 're going to grow there , and we 're just like to be in this level , on this high level , which we are good , and economies .
it 's also going to be policy .
it needs goals .
it takes a lot of <unk> , say the economists .
it does n't need to be just like the growth , but we should look at it , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you 're going to measure , and you know , how is it really with the quality of quality , it 's going to ?
is the obvious thing ?
and then we have to measure our politicians .
of course , how is the <unk> ?
how are the things together ?
we need a fundamental aspect of that is , finally , finally , finally , and not the work .
who are you all the entrepreneurs of them , but also the workers , you know , very good .
so what 's kind of <unk> hidden , we have paid a colleague at a colleague .
you could do something different .
the resources are being used to be reduced , and therefore the resources are <unk> and not the work .
and you 've got to do all of all the <unk> in order to ensure employment , to ensure aid , health , infrastructure .
but that 's where you have to have a little bit more hard .
so , that means , you know , more or less , on all levels can work in these direction , we can work hard to the right products , services , as a consumers , what we need to do , how do we do that , how do we do what 's good for us ?
what do we need and we do n't need ?
the right policy , you choose the <unk> .
a few evidence i gave .
and then , of course , of course , the science of the science of 30 of the economists are still going to drive in the direction , how can we drive growth ?
but unfortunately , there 's no way .
when you look at the visible , when you look at the last 20 years , it 's always going to be down because it 's not .
the policy does n't create , and the economists are not going to be growth , but that 's the question , and that 's how do we have a good life ?
so , <unk> 's it .
be the <unk> to the <unk> .
with heart , brain , hand , and last , and last , the most part we need to need .
thank you .
i am retired <unk> .
and i love these city .
this city has to tell you so many stories .
one of them have happened a few hundred years ago .
and to do with more creative things .
and on this creative problem , i 'll be a moment , and on the story later .
they 're going to do with the fortress .
this is serious <unk> who is in the middle of this city , and a lot of these city and also changing .
another story earlier .
it was a hot summer day in <unk> , nevada .
one man you see how to be in his shoes , right ?
it 's too warm .
he 's europeans , he did n't know this with the heat .
he 's making a <unk> of the shoe , and it 's not a <unk> increase in a long <unk> , and there 's a lot of holes in a lot of holes .
he <unk> the shoe again , he 's going to be <unk> , and he realizes the new climate in the shoe .
it 's the shoe , which is born .
and these number one thing you see here is the shoes in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the order of the <unk> today .
a company is <unk> , with four letters .
one or another one of you know it .
he has the original idea of nike and adidas .
both have been rejected .
so he says , good , <unk> , i do my own business .
it 's called the stock market .
there are several thousand workers in <unk> business in <unk> countries in the world .
so much of a creative thing .
why not make a little invent what 's not there ?
and then you might have a question , perhaps the question is <unk> with <unk> .
if you do n't know , it 's not yet familiar , it 's for what is a chance ?
and the question is that the question i 've been helped me , in tough situations .
if a little bit more confusing , or my <unk> , i do n't work or technology , or whatever .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what is a chance ?
and it 's coming from the <unk> <unk> .
so what the difference can do , i 'm telling you with this example .
and another example of the <unk> <unk> was collected , and that 's the <unk> statements of <unk> .
and the evidence that is how creative people can be when it comes to their own insurance .
i show you a few examples here .
so , these are actually <unk> at the <unk> <unk> and it did a commercial .
i 'm a fantastic thing .
my son did n't get the woman .
he 's just <unk> , it 's the woman by the <unk> .
or i had the whole day , <unk> , when i reached the intersection , everything was raised a bush in my view , and i could n't see the other vehicle .
all right , who is , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 've been <unk> and two times nearly .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , at the end of the <unk> , you know .
the last one i was not to blame .
it was a young woman in the <unk> .
when you 're a man , each other is obsolete .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it anyway .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i wish and i teach dreams that we all use more of this creativity .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't be that way .
why do n't things just do anything else ?
old things that we 're going to do is the routine who may have been bored or <unk> , as opposite .
so why not just do it , the <unk> , as little simple , simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> businesses that use that .
for example , <unk> , who have these <unk> from their airplane , these signs or the wall , or at the wall of the wall , for example , and then there 's something like that .
one possibility , right ?
for the coffee , rather than the coffee , rather than <unk> .
or what .
we do n't have a <unk> , <unk> .
is there tonight , right ?
if you ca n't go to the cell phone .
or eating me , otherwise we both .
<unk> , but creative .
that 's what it takes .
i have to be one of the clients or the people who would be <unk> and say , okay , which looks like me .
i 'm out of the <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and in <unk> .
once the sports , the most recent news , the policy .
when you were five times , you 're <unk> .
once they got the complaint for a long period of food .
it 's a <unk> building , and the restaurant , and the restaurant , and the restaurant , the restaurant had a little bit of , so the chefs had all the hands .
it was too closely .
what have been thinking about , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't get faster in the kitchen .
this idea is created .
on each table , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> salt , pepper and <unk> .
so that the people in the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for you .
simple .
a creative idea , and maybe also solved with the <unk> .
there 's a person who 's not just <unk> .
they 're the person who is the leader of the <unk> , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and there 's the german <unk> .
now , the second day , it takes a monday , so four days .
a company has taken <unk> <unk> for the employees of month , and maybe you might have , which .
a <unk> says , rather than <unk> , we thank you .
people are going to be <unk> in the day .
the buses are filled with a <unk> , it 's <unk> , people are organizing in carpool because each of course , of course , of course , from other , of a <unk> , from a <unk> .
but why do n't we have some kind of use of use and creative from his disadvantage ?
sometimes the creativity happens too .
and it 's coming from a <unk> , perhaps in this company , you might know .
so we have known that there 's not really good , but that you have to have to save a lot of <unk> .
or the <unk> in the car .
there 's the different , <unk> , and all kinds of directions .
yes .
why not be a piece of <unk> in the car , when you 're <unk> ?
or in <unk> , there 's also opportunities to make a creative .
and all that has just to do with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
my <unk> son was in the office .
and she 's sitting on this <unk> .
so , we have several <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he turns out of the left , he 's joy , and i 'm going to tell you in my secret <unk> , '' you know , `` yes , i 'm not a playground here .
he to me , look at me , big eyes , playground , playground .
and in the moment i 'm actually , right ?
why is n't a playground ?
why is what we do , not the playground for adults ?
well , a lot of things , right ?
when we 're lazy if we use our talents , what we do .
and there are <unk> , but it 's relaxed .
the <unk> is that when a particular day of the week is changing in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow our focus on a day .
so that 's how another day we would rather have to do .
so in the weekend .
you know , that 's the media .
<unk> is , yeah , a day to weekend .
or if you announced the most beautiful time of the year , the vacation .
what are the rest of the day of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
have we all so terrible jobs ?
a <unk> had been given it in front page , this topic .
yes , monday , i 'm out and the rest of life you want to do .
or on <unk> , facebook , all over the social networks are taken this subject .
i once <unk> in the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i 'd like to look at the way .
what have these in the <unk> , what are there ?
and one day , i <unk> this business with this person to buy this .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , that 's pretty nice .
so , from so , from that love to work .
i also <unk> that , i 'm a parent of five kids , but i also love my work .
yes .
or even <unk> for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
and why your own attitude , which is shown there , and it 's still going to continue .
someone who has a answer to this direction , it 's not the monday , it 's your jobs .
and i actually actually ask with the pink pair of <unk> , and say , okay , all the way .
what about my job is beautiful ?
stupid is , even if it 's the pink glasses , it looks like before .
so something beautiful , that 's not nice , does n't work .
the pink pair of <unk> are <unk> .
there 's what you 're going to fly in a wonderful place , which is going to be in the eye in the eye .
but they do n't <unk> .
where is we going to do that when we do n't change this ?
in fact , the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside as a <unk> .
it might end up in a system where we feel like that as we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes up in this wheel and running and running and going to go and get to quickly , and then eventually , it 's going to get back , this wheel is getting the poor mouse and you get out .
what is the mouse ?
they do n't know anything else , it 's all in the <unk> .
and again , and again , again , the movie is <unk> the <unk> , you might be able to get soft .
this is nice <unk> here with hay , so you do n't have a mess there , and it 's always going to go and over again .
and that 's what we 're going to have a funny , probably the mouse thought , yes ?
or something is that <unk> <unk> .
i was so much in a lot of years ago , from a seminar home .
and in a while , the road turned on me , i felt very black in my eyes , and somehow i have to stay .
the next day , i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there ?
he was looking at me and he said , no way , is physically in order .
but what 's the <unk> ?
and i looked at my calendar to check this , and saw three weeks , and i was also working on the job .
and after six years , in the <unk> and participants who can do first in early in the night in the night earlier .
i have thought , what are there in jobs ?
and we started making <unk> , again , to look at other priorities , to look at my family with my family , something good for me .
and in fact , whether it 's not a serious <unk> in my job , a new piece .
i realized , the talks about the talks about large groups , who are really happy .
i go to like a <unk> and <unk> and other things , but these talks to be allowed to be able to share with these talks , experience , experiences , are really joy .
and that was n't always the case .
i 've got to see that these <unk> <unk> are ill .
and sometimes it 's right , so it 's going to be a piece of the boat , <unk> of me from the hospital , after he had a heart attack , and then he starts to say , <unk> .
in the past , when i said , you 'll leave you with a <unk> , yeah , you know , you know , you know , you go with your running and so .
today , it 's the way .
so , with <unk> , beautiful , slowly , in the right <unk> , but then we 'll also go together in common .
what happens ?
in the bottom , we 're all healthier .
the <unk> walk down , but one curve that 's going on , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> four percent of four percent of the last 10 years , <unk> percent , almost minus percent , that 's beautiful , that 's less .
rise of the mental illness plus <unk> percent .
this is something where i think is that ?
why is that ?
is that just in austria ?
no , also in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , that 's going to be healthier .
that 's how you see here in the left .
in the bottom of the lower diseases , plus a half percent within the last 10 years , a big german <unk> .
the number of <unk> <unk> takes .
the cost .
and it 's looking at all kinds of official , what can we do with this topic ?
now , even more and some of them are getting <unk> , like this .
so , it 's good .
and somebody once said , no alcohol is no answer .
but what is the solution ?
what is that what we do , and it 's going to be a good thing ?
and that 's the last years .
i 've got to have something like <unk> , can you give something like this ?
i 'm a <unk> who is n't the job that 's not what it 's going to be <unk> and happy .
there 's a lot of other things that are important , family , health , believe , and so on .
but in fact , we have the largest part of our <unk> in the work .
and if we do that , why does n't do that , it 's not going to do it as well , and then it 's also a delight .
the <unk> <unk> i 'm telling you as well as a result , to provide the <unk> .
so these little <unk> , you hope to make it easier .
<unk> is for talent and freedom and environment .
what does that mean , i mean , i mean , how do i mean my talents ?
what are i doing that in which , i do that with who ?
what the freedom i have to do , what i want to do ?
because of course , is the level of the <unk> , which is <unk> .
the more it , the more stress .
and what do i do ?
it 's the muscle .
that 's the four parts .
and it can check it for themselves .
i had to look at this for me for me , and i 'm always going to keep it all the time .
can i use my talents ?
in what the environment ?
and that means , sometimes i go into a cafe with my laptop to prepare for the seminar or a <unk> .
the freedom .
what freedom can i take to do what is important .
and do i do it ?
it 's the muscle .
the last u .
and then there 's people who tell me why that does n't go .
and why is a lot more difficult .
and i 'd like to have a answer to this point .
who wants to find ways .
who is not , there 's reasons .
and by the point of the point , you can choose to choose , i think , i think , i need to make ways , or i have some reasons ?
and they 're going to be in two .
so what do we do with our talents ?
each of you have his big <unk> <unk> .
it 's much too small .
it 's filled with <unk> , with gold , everything , with their capabilities .
what do we do that ?
by the end of the <unk> , we have to ask ourselves .
or if we 're in the hospital or at the end of a life .
what did i do with my talents ?
and by the way , who 's doing , who is doing on <unk> <unk> , and he wants to access to there .
so what do we do with our talents , so my first question , also in me , and that 's every day .
i mean , `` well , i mean , good enough ?
and resources .
there was a story with a story .
i wanted to tell you about <unk> .
and i 'm going to do that one .
these fortress was saving saved for the <unk> years ago as a result of the <unk> .
and the enemy realized that the fortress was so good that you could n't take them .
black walls , <unk> ways , <unk> <unk> to the fortress , thick doors , <unk> <unk> .
was a <unk> time .
so the thing , the thing , okay , okay , if we do n't get a box , we form a <unk> .
we do n't get out there , and we do n't blow up .
let 's look at how long as it 's happening .
the <unk> had been made of long until the day of the day , the <unk> had been used .
they 've only had a <unk> of the way to get <unk> as the <unk> to the chicago , and give me this <unk> and give me three days .
the bishop okay , <unk> , you 've got it , i 'm sure , come up , come on , go , take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> go with the <unk> path .
in a time , the enemies are <unk> at the forest of the hills , and over the left to right , and already in the left .
good , think , a <unk> , what is that .
it 's day .
again , a <unk> <unk> , at the top of the fortress , this time , it 's black .
enemies are thinking , oh , who has two <unk> , it might take one more .
the same scenario , the time , again , it 's the same time , this is the <unk> .
at the end of the second day , after six different <unk> ends , they were running in a <unk> .
because they thought it takes us to a long time that we do n't think more .
afterwards , the <unk> went down to the <unk> and <unk> .
one thing they had and have the <unk> .
it 's the <unk> <unk> .
i like this idea that everything we need , and that we have everything .
sometimes it 's high resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but also , again , we can do something .
we have no idea of power that we have to invent the world .
and if you believe this could be a good <unk> , then you 're right .
in the spring , the spring rolls .
come .
and we in <unk> know , there 's the snow <unk> there , it 's going to catch the plants from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there are blooms of these blooms of these blooms of the fruit .
there 's a fantastic thing that we 're <unk> here , and then we harvest .
there 's the grain of this grain , we can get into it and provide bread .
there are any animals that eat .
there 's people who then eat products later later .
and it 's being automatic .
but if you think about it 's not thinking about that , maybe that 's not as automatically it is being scared and worried .
and of course , this threat may just be quite abstract , but in the area of the blooms , the connection of the plant are not very , very , very large .
there are the research that show up to <unk> percent of our food , in particular food is not there if we had no bees .
also , also , that sounds like this is as <unk> because it 's normal for us , and we may not perceive it as well .
there was a very interesting movie , a very interesting movie , <unk> .
and i recommend you , look at it .
but now , let 's look at the lord `` the lord '' of the gentleman in the <unk> , which is not working with bees , who are in school , in <unk> , the importance of bees .
and that 's what he does with a school at <unk> and he 's going to tell us a little bit about his work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
only one big thank you a big thank you to mr. <unk> and on the whole <unk> .
that i 'm going to talk about my project , <unk> , <unk> , to provide something about the life of the bees .
and also , under a wing , there 's a picture of a <unk> , which is a lot of fun doing this .
now , i 'm going to suppose that the most people of them are now , it would be a <unk> company in <unk> minutes in the basics of beekeeping .
i do n't do that , no .
but maybe it might be able to do it to love these <unk> , or a certain empathy of you to develop them to that <unk> , <unk> astronomy of the bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm a gorgeous woman , married , a wonderful woman , father from five children , and <unk> <unk> and work in <unk> and adults .
i 'm a member of the <unk> in the <unk> , and in the hunger , <unk> <unk> .
and now , now , now in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> at <unk> with our elders students in the <unk> sciences .
we work there in the backyard , in agriculture and beekeeping .
<unk> is actually a play of <unk> <unk> and is <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is more a <unk> , a quiet , a quiet thing .
and she also leads to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not for free , the old greeks have known to the context of honey <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he 's like the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to inspire him , that he can be dense .
but the <unk> are not going to go in itself , but they send their blue bees and <unk> the poets in the mouth , and again , the words later that honey from the <unk> .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully it 's going to happen to me tonight .
yes .
flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of these <unk> , this <unk> of the <unk> are built my students together in the <unk> of food days in a <unk> days .
in <unk> schools in <unk> , in college or in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> in <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> or <unk> in <unk> .
the teacher who is accompanied this project with me in the class and we 're looking at a piece of place for a <unk> place .
the window at the same time , the kids can see something like this month .
and all of all things , so the bees like that , which are there in the hose and again .
and then there 's the window that is created a room .
so .
and then the whole thing begins with me .
so i 'm going to take a <unk> and <unk> , '' now , in one of these <unk> , two <unk> , and now they 're going to be here in these <unk> .
so , crucial to this <unk> , so they are <unk> bees .
also , we also have <unk> <unk> , and here has to be fresh <unk> , so fresh eggs .
and then a <unk> , there 's the top .
there 's honey .
they need bad weather , and you ca n't fly .
so .
this looks like this .
and then the <unk> here is coming up here , and immediately , the transportation begins with the transportation of the transportation of the transportation of these things , or in school .
and now , something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees are there in the class of the time , all the crisis .
their people are not more .
they are lonely .
they do n't find your queen .
and this is the most important task of the <unk> , when he makes these <unk> , that he 's going to be the <unk> in the old people .
so that is not on this two <unk> .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they begin to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , she <unk> .
you hear that .
they 're almost more likely to be higher than when they 're normally <unk> in your <unk> with a queen .
and now , a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night now , they 're going to provide the need to be a new people , and the whole thing happens to be done without <unk> , without conferences , without talking , without the religious and positions .
so here 's the people agree and then it 's a little bit of the first night .
because without the queen , this people would n't exist more .
because <unk> lives only six weeks .
so .
and in this first night , they get out of one of these <unk> <unk> , and they get an egg in these <unk> .
and there 's a <unk> .
everyone who had <unk> in high school in high school , say , `` do it go ?
yes , genetically <unk> is all genetically <unk> .
that 's true .
and now , something wonderful .
so , this <unk> , what 's going to be in the <unk> is a <unk> , in the <unk> .
the <unk> has the first three days the same genetic code like the <unk> code .
and then it 's going to be fed by a <unk> .
you know this term .
and immediately , on this <unk> , the genetic code .
the <unk> are being transformed by the <unk> in the <unk> .
we 've heard that before , what we eat is what 's going to be out of us .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
so three days , so , five days <unk> .
and this is the students all <unk> .
you see in the class .
and then this cell is <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and the whole thing does n't happen , because the people now is <unk> , or because one of the <unk> says , or you do n't say it 's a group of power , your power is .
no , this is happening .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or an <unk> decision .
and then the students of eight days waiting for every student , three five eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight , so there 's a queen , so that the queen 's <unk> .
and so the day , if you 're going to happen , the teachers have <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> in the students in the students , yes .
and then the mother , tell what 's going on here ?
yeah , i have to school .
yeah , why ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then the morning to have six in school .
and then the <unk> <unk> on this <unk> , because they want to <unk> the queen now .
and if you see the real person , you know , it 's first .
these queen <unk> .
so .
another higher .
and then the <unk> and <unk> , the queen .
the first thing that these queen is , they spread their wing , and there 's now with her <unk> , and now , with her <unk> , what themselves was a queen , her <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> .
the people have a identity .
now three to five days for five to five days .
you see the <unk> in front of your <unk> <unk> .
at the back , the bat comes out of the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days , this queen goes out of the <unk> .
now , some think i 've seen , i 've already seen a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
wait , <unk> .
which is completely different .
so , let 's go .
this is the queen the <unk> flies now with no <unk> , without <unk> , from that <unk> , to two miles up .
you 've never seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> and there 's a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , from seven to 12 drones , male bees .
so the other other vice versa like islam where the man have a man have to have the queen who have seven to 12 men .
and all in a wonderful way in the flight .
the drone is from the back of the back of these queen , and this queen takes all of the <unk> <unk> in this <unk> <unk> , which you need to put in seeds for three years .
for the drone , it 's an amazing experience .
when you get finished with the <unk> , she 's dead and it falls dead .
and then the queen comes back and starts to put eggs .
there 's always a , two students in the class that see the moment .
you see the queen 's queen .
yes .
and then slowly the project ends up because now the <unk> and the queen is going to be in the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> is going to be inside there .
and then i 'm going to come from one night before , and then you find that <unk> .
`` the <unk> of the outside , and on the next morning , i 'm betting the queen with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there you see the queen .
yes .
<unk> <unk> .
and it 's mostly 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then this is , that two <unk> are coming here in a <unk> .
in a <unk> stick , in a prey , and now this people can be large and powerful .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the children who have the experienced is never forget .
yes .
and there 's not just that , in this class , the students who are all the time with the bees , but the whole school comes in this class .
and the teachers when he knows something , if he can be prepared to be prepared to join a period of the other .
look at all , bees and serious years ago , we 've got some cave paintings , where people did n't have the honey to honey .
a few months ago , a few months ago , you found in israel 's old <unk> years ago in which people have been having the bees .
all human culture has grown with honeybees .
or vice versa , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india , in egypt , in greece in greece in rome in rome .
they were all over .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are over .
he can be a <unk> , a <unk> join , he can join a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , you know what flowers or trees are <unk> , what you need ?
that you see something out there now in the summer in agriculture .
there 's there , this is a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can go through the students in the <unk> , and there 's some flowers in the <unk> , you know , the <unk> of bees , and look at how long we need to do it from my flowers ?
how long are you on the individual ?
and how long , you need to come back .
he can make a <unk> <unk> .
how do i <unk> a <unk> ?
yes .
you know , if this is that this is the top of the top of the top , there 's a little bit of flat page , right ?
look at all .
he can be a math -- a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can see the students in the students at the <unk> .
and then he 's going to go to the question , how did <unk> <unk> the nobel prize ?
because it took that the bees are seeing in the beehive .
but ladies and gentlemen , it 's <unk> .
there 's not a bee .
and just the professor of the professor who taught many years in university has taught in university , in <unk> , the bees found out there in a <unk> .
like a <unk> net from the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and now with <unk> hertz , the <unk> <unk> , and the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , with her <unk> .
see what these bees are doing in school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they lose their fear of fear .
and develop a awareness for the bees .
they learn <unk> , that 's what the bees do .
and they get a warning of these creatures , which is basically lives for us .
the bees are not even more even a kilo of a half a person in the year .
<unk> years ago , the only way to create <unk> .
you 're collecting the <unk> in the trees .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> of them .
and now imagine the summer , these are <unk> , <unk> bees on such a narrow space , in <unk> level .
hey , there 's <unk> without end .
no , it 's not .
because they have natural population of antibiotics .
you collect pollen , and it 's making it <unk> , it 's going to be <unk> , a vibrant <unk> .
someone who is in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who can go to a <unk> , and let me give a <unk> prescribe from the people from the people .
of course , there 's a grid , and with <unk> with a <unk> , and so on , there 's nothing happens .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , the auction of the <unk> , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , and we would have less apples , and we would have less apple , if the bees would n't fly , or we would have to be able to fly like the chinese , and they would have to be able to be able to the chinese .
there 's a lot more connections .
look at the <unk> , there 's the north pole , where the cows graze .
and there 's the bee goes down , and they get their nectar and <unk> <unk> .
and now the cow is coming , and it 's got the <unk> , and , because they 're going to <unk> <unk> , you can digest .
yeah ?
and then she <unk> it , and it 's obvious , ah , i got <unk> , ah , i can <unk> it .
and then there 's milk .
this is the bee .
yeah ?
and at the end of the end of the paintings , the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of what we have on nature .
the honey .
i 'm going to just want to go to the point , <unk> .
my students are looking at each year when they build these <unk> and then partly to me with me together .
now , that 's not my <unk> , but i had a student , and i told you in college school in college , and i told you , `` you know , <unk> <unk> , ''
and then he says , yeah , i grew up <unk> .
i come from <unk> and i 'm six years .
and i 've been in <unk> for five years , and in two years in the <unk> .
and i 'm glad i 'm not going to learn that i have n't going to learn from the <unk> , but i can learn to learn the hands .
<unk> , yeah .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> college , <unk> college .
and more than half , you know , oh yeah , we want to .
my students are a huge appreciation of a huge appreciation and the parts between , in <unk> , regular and the <unk> people being pulled through the bees .
she 's <unk> , and they get self-esteem , my students and a pride of pride .
how do you get the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you need to say , how do you get to the <unk> ?
and there 's what i think , there 's the person who is , the person who is <unk> , and there 's a new <unk> .
and he says , `` so , we start .
a little poem from <unk> <unk> .
who 's like the bee would be the bee by the <unk> , and you never get the path to the <unk> , and they never lose the direction of the <unk> in <unk> <unk> , as soon he would n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love of all friends in the world .
welcome to my project .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of the female <unk> .
in my eyes , the biggest crimes of humanity , because it 's been <unk> for <unk> years .
the society against women with the women 's <unk> sacrifice a day .
first i 'm looking at .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there was a <unk> business , <unk> .
you can think that 's not the job of the job .
i did n't feel <unk> .
and that 's why i was glad i could <unk> me in the subject of the subject to the subject of the subject , and i could <unk> it .
for example , this .
with a massive <unk> , over the atlantic from africa from brazil .
on the world , a meeting in the morning , the <unk> genocide in the last <unk> indians stop the <unk> .
this was a journey where i was more <unk> than <unk> , more than <unk> .
but yet , these are the way these are attracted to find the interest of media and even a little person like i could make his cause of the world .
and i 've got a little <unk> in ethiopia .
there was war between the <unk> and ethiopia , and we 've got <unk> of this killings .
and despite all cruelty , which is the infinite side of the other , the infinite hospitality of the <unk> , who are <unk> <unk> , arab hospitality .
and twice it happened when we were invaded invaded and our two <unk> , which you see here in front of us , and the <unk> <unk> in front of us , and they said that 's my people .
if you have to kill you , you have to shoot by us .
there was something like i found in no other culture .
and then in young years , they 've learned that you ca n't reduce islam in terrorism .
and christians do n't want to be reduced to their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather than the true values like someone , social accountability .
these are the values to fight it .
i 've been a lot of years , i 've been in this <unk> , with my wife .
and then we were listening to this <unk> female <unk> .
when i heard that <unk> percent of the daily victims , the rest are christians and <unk> , i thought how to be a <unk> like islam , besides <unk> terror in the shoes ?
and the idea was born the highest shifts of islam to explain to the sin .
we were looking at <unk> with german organizations that have not found .
now , we would be listening to it , we 'd be very <unk> , which islam is not <unk> .
you would have my neck .
in <unk> international international , we started designing our own organization .
and they were independent and <unk> .
and to do this struggle , we needed to win images .
it was a lack of it .
and that 's why , and i moved back in this desert to make these images of these images .
and the bad bloody images , i do n't show you , but i want to get the crimes of this crimes .
girl in the age of four weeks , eventually , at the end of my parents , at the end of her parents and relatives , on the <unk> , on the limbs on the limbs , and as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> instruments without the <unk> instruments without <unk> instruments without the <unk> instruments without <unk> and anatomy and the <unk> .
what 's going to get a room from the size of a <unk> .
now , your name is a <unk> .
if you get your rule , they were going to have two weeks .
being unimaginable , in the body and soul , their dignity were expanding .
this was the beginning of called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> , it 's on .
the man has to open up .
he never seen one <unk> woman .
the <unk> said he said , `` well , <unk> , is not a problem .
you <unk> your penis with <unk> , and then you poke hard .
and if you do n't do it , not bad .
and you take the knife and <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> .
one third of the girl .
this was 10 months ago .
<unk> was lost his language .
these are the <unk> , also some in asia .
most of these are <unk> .
and when we find muslims , why did you do that ?
was the <unk> answer , which is we have to do that , which is in the koran .
nothing is in the koran , totally in the opposite .
every believers , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the prayer , like <unk> <unk> , who is , who is , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe what you pray there .
they 're <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of the women who has been wrong wrong , and why you could be a <unk> person to be <unk> , and so you could be <unk> in women .
but now we had the first pair of the first pair of these <unk> .
he <unk> , his whole <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there was hard discussions , two days .
but we had the minister of the minister on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the great decision who came up with all of the human rights , for the religion , we have to ban him .
the last one was <unk> this new <unk> .
and when you know africa , and the <unk> knows , you know , you know , it 's done for these people .
and it became celebration and these successes we had in other countries .
and so short example , <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the country , the <unk> of the message , the <unk> of the message , the <unk> of the message , is that it 's a crime in order to write <unk> and carry on the <unk> .
for weeks , we were the road , with their <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had .
and where we got , we have just open ears , open arms and the historical , holy hospitality .
and when we wanted to leave the country at the end of the country , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to do all of all countries ?
so much of them is not going to give you a little bit more .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> , and there 's got to get slowly .
and in fact , he had an idea .
he said , if it 's going to do it , the 10 <unk> muslims in the world , and explain the needs to the sin , it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo in the <unk> and the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> is right , his <unk> ali <unk> , we got a <unk> .
he heard the idea of it was excited about it , especially , when we could make it possible that we would finance this .
and that 's what we 're doing about <unk> , which are support us .
and then he said , i 'm not just <unk> , so how we had asked him , but i 'll take the <unk> .
and he did .
over cairo <unk> in the years , our transparent .
international <unk> to <unk> the female body of <unk> .
under the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ali <unk> <unk> .
and all of them are .
hundred <unk> , but the highest of the world .
in the middle of the <unk> islands , the man has <unk> in hamburg and the rest of europe is the largest growth of the <unk> of cartoons .
so men and death can decide .
but also the others .
on the left of the left <unk> , on the right , my <unk> .
the highest of the world .
and about that , i 'm just going to have a vacuum and <unk> personally .
and then i took all the <unk> .
it started the conference .
and under our frill on the left of links from egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> egypt , <unk> mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much to the subject , islam is not <unk> .
we had medical school students in their way , which is a terrible thing , which is the awful terrible thing you want to do with the women .
and then they had to show her film , <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they moved back behind <unk> doors to two hours , and she wrote a <unk> .
the <unk> in front of the cameras , announced what you 've chosen .
and the most important phrase , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime in the highest values of islam .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought that was done , but the bill had done without our <unk> .
because the shame , about the abdomen of the woman is stronger than anybody understood .
that 's what we 've been doing .
we 've got this conference in this called golden book .
one <unk> for the <unk> of the world .
and because of the <unk> , the <unk> , it was so good , it 's a <unk> .
it 's going to get us from the hands .
we were in many countries had to conferences with the top of the highest <unk> .
and she was reading the interest in the interest , so it was so excited about it .
but , unfortunately , most of the courage to come to the courage to be too .
you 're not going to talk about the abdomen of the woman in the mosque .
just a couple of have the courage .
they were in the universities , on <unk> .
and sometimes we 've found some bold <unk> in the mosque , which is what you 've got in the mosque like this .
and then there 's all over speakers in the <unk> .
and these are the subjects .
they 're going to spread .
but i 'm going to get the time .
it 's all <unk> on hot stones , and that 's why i work on many other strategies , this subject .
<unk> <unk> .
but my <unk> that would be this .
i want to announce the great message of the world in the <unk> of islam , which is the kaaba in mecca .
not as <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
when there are four million people together come together , men and women are the islamic currents .
and then i <unk> with all of the <unk> and the <unk> king of my transparent with the <unk> <unk> .
and i 've got this in the <unk> .
unfortunately , the last <unk> , that would be king .
but i 'm sure when he would be <unk> .
for one to help these women .
for other , to show the world , which is the true values of islam , rather than just <unk> .
the terrorists as a <unk> .
and if i do n't do that , then , maybe i may not find that , i might have this one , what in hamburg have ever been .
so at least , at least many <unk> in the mosques in the world .
and we could get our transparent there .
and maybe i may still have to be that little girl has to have his daughters more <unk> .
and then my life has been the equivalent of it .
and i want to say , i want to say , you know , i want to have to have a person who 's heard of you , and you 've got to have to join me .
it 's not going to come from a <unk> .
we have to get a practice in the ton , and there 's no one of this stage .
and now i 'd like to give you the 3d design of my <unk> .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and this is in all the <unk> in the top of the name of the name of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> that has always to play .
there 's the bottom , we also have it in german .
female <unk> is incompatible with the koran and the ethics of islam .
she 's <unk> and a discrimination of the islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm going to start with this .
this is how the <unk> looked like that you grew up in germany .
at the <unk> , my mother , my brother , my brother , and i to <unk> a package of this package .
<unk> <unk> .
my mom was completely horrified , because they did n't know why it 's been <unk> .
the third day we 've been trained .
and we were able to get the trash , and then it was going to throw it back to a <unk> woman , and they were just <unk> in <unk> .
she tried to explain that you can do it .
that 's not <unk> .
it actually tastes very good .
it 's cheese .
my mother moved to the eyebrow and we laughed .
cheese .
in my own country , we would have noticed that , but it did n't smell so <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
fifteen years ago , i am my mom and my brother from china to china .
from this <unk> , i 'm telling you today .
but mostly , it 's all about the people who allowed these <unk> and have done a success story .
but first , i first tell you where i am on .
i am retired .
<unk> are a little <unk> that live in the northwest of china .
and this region is called the chinese .
it 's about <unk> miles away from germany .
china is in china , 10 million <unk> , but in <unk> , the largest <unk> community outside china .
and that <unk> life that 's why there 's because we have to be suffering from in china .
hundreds of china became extra to <unk> relocated to our own home .
our own language , our own language , <unk> became <unk> .
in schools and in universities , they 're only taught in the schools .
and our religion can not confuse it .
the <unk> are losing their culture and identity .
and if somebody 's courageous , and for the rights of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or even death or even death .
and that was also the reason why my parents decided to escape , to escape .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this is a little bit about our escape .
we did n't had enough money , so that 's why my father had to be behind it .
i 'm involved in a lot of people who helped us in the escape .
i 'm betting myself in a lot of images .
but i 'm looking at all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> it in front of me when i <unk> my eyes .
he was a big one of the <unk> , and we met it , and we met him with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first one is to be a <unk> .
i know many of a bad picture of <unk> <unk> did n't want to do that business are using business , and they do n't want to be interested in the fates .
but i 'm <unk> , i call it <unk> , not as a <unk> .
because <unk> has brought us months .
he stood on the airport in <unk> in <unk> in a <unk> , and in the last conclusion , whether we were really safe from the <unk> .
airport in <unk> , we came up , and i know how my mother somehow told me from the airport .
do n't you tell you .
until we 're outside .
because i was in my hand , and there was my photograph in my hand , but there was an alien name , <unk> .
i had to have a <unk> .
and i 'm <unk> in <unk> <unk> , who had my passport in the hand .
silence .
sweat .
a long look .
we were finally <unk> .
in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , i was involved in a lot of <unk> who had somehow been very supported very much .
i <unk> myself to the <unk> woman who have used to be used in the <unk> .
in a <unk> , four <unk> per <unk> of 13 families .
at least , the children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was foreign faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother , and i had to share a <unk> .
there was eaten , and she had done , and homework .
friends have not come to me because i 'm betting where we were .
just my <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> knew i knew .
she had my story , and they knew very , and they were <unk> me .
for example , for example , she brought me to me <unk> what i do n't do .
but she 's acting in a kind of german school <unk> .
i spent my whole story in the <unk> .
it was not just for my mother .
with each other alone , without her man , and in the uncertainty of the uncertainty , because we had a <unk> , and could n't get a <unk> and could n't be a <unk> .
i 'm betting me that i was very , very , very aggressive .
it 's also a little bit of embarrassing , which is now going to tell you , but now i have to be just to my story .
i was very aggressive , and i could be very bad at school .
and the <unk> took us a little bit of the catholic , where we had to have a first time to be a little bit of regular kids .
i mean , i 'd like to be normal , i had to live in a <unk> .
i also <unk> myself to the <unk> and <unk> my brother or <unk> .
it 's just a little bit about it .
i also <unk> myself in several <unk> to us with homework , because our parents could n't have german .
or they 're just going to <unk> .
we are always very happy .
i know how we were looking at the fence of the fence and wait until these people , because , somehow <unk> people had to us , and that was important to us .
after two years , my father finally came to germany .
but the problem was that he was going to be a little bit of <unk> , because it did n't find a place in <unk> .
i 'm looking at the very , very , very <unk> , the father of my father ago , to preserve it in order to preserve it in <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm betting myself in this time where i really have very , very happy , because after six years , we had to draw a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we finally had a own apartment with a personal and a personal kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was very small , and i had no desk in there , but it was good , i could close my door .
and i <unk> myself , i 've got the time , very good , but i had to leave the <unk> and leave a conclusion .
i really did n't have a perspective on me .
and there was a <unk> that has been supported me in the <unk> , and it still does n't do it on the idea that i can get over the second <unk> .
first , the <unk> .
so i was so much the teachers who really believed in me , and i was really not just too easy to the time , i 've even made it until the middle east .
afterwards , i came to the <unk> .
and before i was playing with the <unk> , i was playing with my best friend <unk> .
<unk> is a organization or a project of organized organized .
but i was n't a good <unk> that i 've been doing that because we had a place where we could just go in <unk> .
we had a <unk> , which we had our <unk> <unk> .
and the ladder of <unk> helped us had to tell us our problems , and he was public , and we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a kind of questions .
and then i came to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people without a conclusion , who have a conversation with a <unk> .
so this was really done very well , and i realized that art is something like me .
by <unk> and the encounter , a filmmaker came up to us .
he made the film <unk> over my friends and me .
and the movie won great prices .
we realized that people were interested in our story .
he was a very special feeling , because we 've never experienced that people had listening to us .
and that was a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to <unk> anymore .
i want to make something from my life .
a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , to me to join me to a <unk> of the <unk> .
but there i had a little bit in the <unk> building me , i ended up at a <unk> for a piece of play , and it 's called four to four .
so i was right .
i played .
and the great thing is that after a performance of two editors ' <unk> <unk> on me .
and i had wondered , if i had a interest in a way to make your own <unk> .
i thought , great , <unk> .
let me go .
and i made a little bit for the <unk> <unk> , now , a pulse of <unk> and one of my parts over a play , where i was placed in the european <unk> .
and i 've actually won him .
now , i study the <unk> and film <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i 'm a <unk> <unk> .
and that would n't be done for me , if not only if not a single or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> or projects like <unk> , like <unk> , for me , so i could use good for me .
you 've got out of me , you have open spaces , they 've shown me , you 've been looking for me , how i was doing my place in society .
and i 'm going to get you to you now .
each of you have the possibility of people who have to help me get people like me to get a second chance , and you find your life or their place in society .
because , people , every single hundred refugees come from refugees , and each of them are filled with hope and each of them has a big potential .
they have a lot of determination to make a lot of awful hurdles .
and with this determination , they could be a lot of profit for germany and for each one of us .
and i could actually tell you a thousand things , which you can do , but i do n't have enough time , even though there 's a minute , i brought a <unk> .
now , you get your cell phone out , you ca n't tell me that you ca n't have a code .
you scan the code , and then you come on the side of <unk> with a lot of incentives , which they can do .
and that would help us very well .
i 'm now looking at the time now , and we 'll see ourselves outside .
and they scan the code .
i mean , it 's the <unk> .
a lot of you did n't have the cell phone in the hand .
are you so happy , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> .
just a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
okay , i 'm going to give you to contact .
my name is robin .
my favorite thing is , she 's called simple than it talks .
i 'm coming from austria , in vienna .
i 'm glad i 'm very , very , very , in <unk> , is really beautiful .
i 'm very much probably in there every time .
and that 's no phrase that 's a feeling .
yes , yeah , unlike the other <unk> , i 'm not not going to talk to you about anything .
i did n't know what .
it 's so , it 's why i write the text in my spare time , and then this is going to talk about this one somewhere else , mostly in <unk> or <unk> or <unk> like this .
yeah , and i became asked to talk a few texts , to read the whole program a little bit .
and that 's what i 'm going to do here tonight .
yes .
i start with a joke .
meet two chickens .
so that 's one thing , are two english chickens i <unk> , and so they do n't <unk> <unk> , but they 're going to be very funny and <unk> , and they 're going to be <unk> in <unk> .
tell the other thing .
hey , there 's no <unk> me .
this is what we would have the level .
the first text is a little <unk> that i wrote .
i 've got to get a person to one person who 's partly what means .
it 's wearing the title .
and she did n't understand it .
when your head in my lap , your rest was under my ceiling .
my leg was also under my lower leg outside the ceiling .
my leg was in the ceiling .
it 's about your own head , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the rest of my lap , the rest of her face , my leg also under the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling .
and that has been <unk> , when my leg was extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the next text , i also got to a person who is very easy to me .
and my grandpa .
we have no contact of any more .
my <unk> grandfather was <unk> .
now , as a kid , he 's got a kid with love .
i mean , right , yeah .
yes , there 's <unk> text .
better .
jesus is the only <unk> is on the <unk> of the bus .
but where was he when he was going to save me to save the <unk> ?
so are we thinking ?
did i have my <unk> ?
next text .
the next text is a little bit more .
it actually takes a second .
so to write .
marcus : read faster .
this is the beginning of a novel i write in the <unk> .
ah , it 's about <unk> guy , so the adventure from a guy who keeps the hair and a little bit of <unk> .
but i 'm always chasing myself in this point of the <unk> .
because i 'm never going to be the hairs .
chapter one .
if i get <unk> , my head is empty .
so empty as the slate , it 's trying to fill it .
yeah , i 'm not coming .
very hard a year .
the next text is also a little bit of <unk> .
most people do n't understand it .
i do n't stop myself .
and that 's the thing that i 'm going to play with my vocabulary and with my language .
i always liked to play with me .
and then , you get out , get things out .
it 's wearing the title .
is a little bit of funny .
probably the <unk> <unk> that i 've ever wrote .
<unk> , we can .
yes , we <unk> .
we can .
we <unk> .
i 'm not going to ca n't here .
but i can .
i do n't know .
i do n't do it .
yes , i did n't understand .
no idea .
yeah , yeah , <unk> <unk> .
i always tell you , either or no one .
the next page has also to do what to do with text .
it 's kind of a little <unk> .
i wrote the same thing to insects .
very polite .
yes , there 's <unk> text .
is a little turret .
and this is something that 's cool , when i do that , you know , you know , you know , it might be a three .
my text wearing the title , all good things are cool .
so , in the way , there 's <unk> dry .
we have <unk> <unk> .
so , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and scratch , and then it 's going to be better and yes , and it 's it .
beautiful moment .
yes , <unk> <unk> , this is another one .
and this is something that 's cool when i could make all the way that we 're all so much more sophisticated , so that 's all the way we 've got all the time .
exactly , so what the wind is going to do .
the text is wearing the title , and so the <unk> .
yes .
power is for you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write so much like that .
this is a <unk> <unk> slide .
<unk> is called <unk> s .
s s ?
yes , yeah .
power is for you .
yes , <unk> sentence .
it 's written in <unk> .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's going to be able to be impossible to explain , <unk> , that 's the point .
here 's another text .
this day is a <unk> .
it 's the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he had known it before , before i have this <unk> .
he was <unk> me , and he would put me <unk> .
i could go later in him later .
i made him the delight .
it was made as a <unk> of all of the other days and put me back to me .
with a <unk> <unk> , where else else ?
and the intent is not to cure him by definition , by <unk> .
and if i was going to get a wake up , it can not be a <unk> day .
is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what 's an amazing einstein , when his steak did n't taste ?
i <unk> .
so .
<unk> sound sounds like the cow .
this is funny .
yeah , the next text has also learned the paper .
it 's rather than political .
so , i do n't write some funny things .
i also write a very political problem .
and that 's what i 'm going to do is , i 'm often asked how i 'm going to do . ''
and , yeah , i 've got this text here .
he 's wearing the title .
my father came from vienna , then in my mother , and i from her .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yeah , i 'd like to make a little bit of advertising .
i ca n't do business or something like that , so i have to make this .
and i 'm also <unk> in the same way , and i also make a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
let 's like to come .
and yes , i 'm <unk> , i 'm actually really <unk> .
and , yes .
i 'm just like to say .
it 's on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little commercials i wrote .
feet .
rich , vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
<unk> .
there 's a funny thing .
i want to write a joke about your friend your friend , but the <unk> was just flat .
yeah , it 's not a <unk> .
<unk> , to stop the <unk> <unk> , and you 're killing you to <unk> the <unk> of it .
yes .
thank you for listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me just start with a <unk> question .
why is you going to do it in the end ?
i think everybody who might be the tax tax tax tax tax , whether he 's going to give up the patient in society .
the answer is quite clear .
we 've seen that the life expectancy of the birth to the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the time
it 's called it to have a difference , <unk> policies , the impact on <unk> .
so why do we know so little ?
why are we covered by <unk> news from the <unk> , who are opposed to each other ?
you 've ever remember the guilty of the guilty of the guilty .
it was fat .
and you thought , if you look at fat from the food , we 're all <unk> and are healthy .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves shelves with different types of <unk> in america , and what did n't have changed that americans have become larger than a year .
then you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
and then , what the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and so forth .
so it 's always <unk> new <unk> <unk> through it .
where all the <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , for at least , for at least , for at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , that we have to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
for example , for a <unk> , there 's one .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , all the <unk> . you all know .
<unk> wrote a lot of a <unk> magazine in a <unk> .
the top <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for this year .
keith <unk> was in place for seven years .
then the newspaper died .
or this lady here .
<unk> <unk> .
the oldest person who has lived in the earth 's market .
<unk> years old .
i know there are somewhere else that claim you , they 're six , but you ca n't find your <unk> .
jean <unk> has become <unk> .
and she 'd heard with <unk> <unk> , but with <unk> , then finally , with <unk> <unk> , to follow the path of virtue and welcome to smoke .
it 's a <unk> .
what is that ?
not that cigarettes are healthy .
but it says more complicated is that aging is very complicated , and that we need clean statistics , we need a little bit of <unk> systems , and we need to ask simple questions .
it 's a very simple question , and a very simple thing , which is in different countries in different countries , women are women are getting older than men .
what is that ?
we 've seen it .
so that 's the average of the <unk> , which is produced in the male <unk> .
and there 's a very simple proof of the way that men are going to be exactly as well as women .
now , now , now , now , you can consider each other for yourself , whether it 's a <unk> <unk> .
austria is a force .
but there 's better tips , no fear .
it 's not consistent with <unk> ties with <unk> .
it sounds complicated , but it 's easy to illustrate .
so , there 's somebody <unk> <unk> and asks what do you do so different or something that they were so old ?
ah .
the grandma has 10 cigarettes every day .
that 's the secret of your age , right ?
now , the ten cigarettes , maybe not only do n't .
or you have <unk> , and the grandma would be without the ten cigarettes .
even hard statistics are not always <unk> .
for example , for example , a lot of hard data , which shows that people who are going to go to the <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> .
do n't .
it 's <unk> .
is that the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's about that people just just had enough money in the pocket of your age , and the <unk> diseases of disease .
but if i give a group of <unk> <unk> , and then these group had spent six percent longer than a <unk> <unk> , but otherwise , but otherwise , then , i would have been a very rich amount of factor in the diet .
and in fact , these attempts have been done .
you have to say , `` well , the <unk> is very <unk> , but even though i agree with my enemies , which is the <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
and this works for a little bit of different organisms .
for example , for bacteria .
you see a <unk> of bacteria .
when we look at the <unk> , in the <unk> line , it 's a little bit more complicated .
the same is true for <unk> , predators , flies , fly and recently , only about two years ago , in the united states , in the united states , that there 's even for monkeys .
it 's not about being <unk> .
it 's also working with <unk> <unk> .
and this is another experiment , which has been done in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you 've taken a <unk> <unk> , and the so-called <unk> called <unk> , a <unk> diet , so that 's a <unk> diet , so you get a lot of diet , so many <unk> and night and night .
and who is , who is a funny , who had grown dick , getting sick and have a lot of bad <unk> and bad <unk> .
now you 've taken a sophisticated parallel <unk> , and it has the exact same number of <unk> only to have been completed .
they 're not allowed to eat in the day , so they ate twice as much .
and these <unk> is <unk> and healthy and they did n't have a <unk> .
although both mice were feeding .
both had a lot of eaten .
a sick and the other healthy .
what 's happening there ?
it 's going to be a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
whenever you get organisms , or cells take food , the organism starts going to go to the organism , <unk> compounds in the cell or <unk> compounds to make energy .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how in the cell , in the cell , mainly , to be <unk> , the age of the age .
the <unk> of the stomach that the blood are <unk> and the cell to provide energy .
and that 's what they 're going to do in the age of <unk> in the age of the age .
this is really the molecular <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , to <unk> it , <unk> <unk> <unk> the lives in different organisms .
and it 's probably , you know , that 's what it works with people .
and we 're learning that they were not going to recommend in <unk> , every little bit of <unk> who should have been fighting a day .
no .
but you 're supposed to say , if you have hunger , ah , maybe the <unk> turned on .
welcome your hunger like a friend .
and it also makes sense of meaning .
in fact , in <unk> , nine nine percent of human history has the person who did , when he had hunger ?
right , he 's gone .
we 're going to get into the fridge , if we have hunger .
and that 's safe in the biology .
now , of course , we know , of course , and this is in the bible , in <unk> <unk> <unk> , who is willing to be ready , but the meat is weak .
paradise looks very different .
here 's already a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> garden .
the three <unk> here is all right now , the food all day .
and that 's kind of <unk> .
so we 've been looking for the search for one-dimensional , which is the molecular answer to the molecular response of the <unk> , although the organism is .
this could be interesting to people whose <unk> are not enough to be <unk> .
and maybe we could protect ourselves from the hardest <unk> of life .
so the question is , so we can <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , although you eat ?
and we have a lot of hundred , the thousand component , natural component .
we have found a found that is called <unk> .
<unk> is a substance of something that 's in all organisms , but also in all organisms .
it 's in the skin .
people have less <unk> in the skin in the skin .
and if we 're going to give <unk> in human cells , for example , you see here .
this is serious cell here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus of it , and we see a lot of thousands of these little <unk> in the cell , which is the crap in the age of the age .
the <unk> cells would look very precisely .
and this works in different organisms .
for example , this is shown in a <unk> .
so we found a sophisticated substance that the molecular <unk> <unk> <unk> .
life because organisms also again .
and the answer is , you see it 's a typical <unk> of a <unk> .
it 's simple <unk> .
after <unk> days , the dead are dead , after stealing days , over half days .
whenever we give up in the drinking water , there 's a little bit more than the animals are getting better and survival .
and we also know that human cells that we have from <unk> <unk> <unk> , in culture , as we have so long as long as we have <unk> .
and latest research in the research , we 've also put on the whole bunch of all the lives in all mice .
and it 's not just the life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now , you want , of course , you want to know where is <unk> ?
as the name says , it 's been found in sperm , there 's where it comes in very high levels .
but i can <unk> them <unk> , too , in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a product of <unk> <unk> , which is true in japan , which is so <unk> .
so we said , we 'd be used to be able to help <unk> <unk> by preventing the crap in the late <unk> , then it might be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be more against <unk> ?
and you have to know that the common denominator of all of the <unk> diseases are that in the age of <unk> in the brain .
and we did experiments in the fact .
you 're going to be wonder , we 've done the fruit flies .
and then fruit flies are also <unk> when they 're old .
they have more <unk> in the brain when they 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are of memory to memory are very similar to people .
now , you 're asking , how the devil has measured the memory of fruit flies ?
this is the experiment we 've done with stephen <unk> of the university berlin .
you take a hundred fruit flies , and there 's a flip of a smell you love .
<unk> .
and let 's go to this <unk> <unk> .
and then they 're going to fly the same way , give you in the next board and give you other things that you love , which is <unk> .
we 're going to enjoy the <unk> , but it 's too serious .
ma <unk> .
and then you take the same way again , they 're doing this .
the drive here are still <unk> in the <unk> , there 's the way you see .
and if you 're there , they give up from one side of the one side and <unk> from another side .
where do all the rest go ?
sure .
<unk> .
except for the two .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , you have character .
i love my <unk> , and i do n't do with such a <unk> reward .
okay .
but it 's serious form of character that is growing .
not just flying .
and we could actually fly the <unk> of flying into <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and the <unk> , which was led to the brain , they were <unk> .
that means , <unk> does n't only be just against aging , but also against <unk> diseases .
and that 's important because we want to have the <unk> increase in the civil war in <unk> .
it does n't make sense to increase the time of the <unk> .
and i do n't want to leave you , without give you a few practical tips , we might potentially get younger .
again , <unk> <unk> .
it 's not about it , you know , it 's the weight or so .
there 's a lot of people in austria , in austria , there 's a day of <unk> people who eat a day and nothing .
this is the <unk> called <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the very good thing .
this is called <unk> .
avoid <unk> .
it 's not about carbs .
it 's really about candy .
you know , you know that <unk> <unk> are sufficient to be diabetes .
and you also know that sugar can accelerate growth from tumors .
so you see this <unk> , which is <unk> .
after 30 days , all dead are dead .
it 's a little bit of glucose from glucose .
to create a <unk> effect .
there 's just one example that works in almost all organisms .
eating vegetables and vegetables .
avoid the gift of too much more <unk> or <unk> .
you know , you know , that <unk> and <unk> cancer can be <unk> .
it 's not under the circumstances of vitamin d .
so we 're a level of level , in the winter , there 's a <unk> in the winter because of vitamin d is in the dark .
for example , you 're at least three times a week , which is trivial .
cigarettes , in spite of the <unk> , <unk> examples , they would be 10 to 10 to six years .
and they 're actually going to be a <unk> of the eternal <unk> <unk> .
the influence of praying and blood pressure on the life expectancy is study .
because the monks of the world is almost like women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , life more than <unk> .
<unk> life longer than <unk> .
but <unk> live longer than <unk> .
just <unk> dying as a <unk> .
what is that ?
people assume that has to do what to do with some emulation .
no way , no way , this is just simple .
now , when there 's an illustration of the window , then i 'm going to go down the <unk> solution , right ?
and what happens is probably going to happen in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what , are <unk> in <unk> circumstances .
so alcohol , it 's <unk> <unk> .
a tough partner has a hard partner or a lot of family with longevity .
they do n't want to have a lot of the busiest street .
now , you think about the same way .
but that 's nothing to do with anything .
it 's about <unk> .
you can have to measure a closer place on a lot of the <unk> street , the more <unk> in blood .
and that also , when he says , i 've got to be used to it .
i 'm going to sleep good and the noise does n't do it .
not true .
he has more <unk> in blood and this is bad .
so sunlight should be powered because of course , of course .
we 've now know that <unk> is very good , very good metabolic effects .
mostly it can lower the <unk> .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice are not protecting against <unk> .
and the idea of the way , our grandmothers had to have our grandmothers , and so we 've got to have <unk> <unk> .
not no sense .
several studies show that dark chocolate can be <unk> against dementia .
just recently , a nice study , which is shown that a piece of a panel is dark , the <unk> <unk> a day , a <unk> .
and the same thing you want to be a little bit of coffee , but it 's a tiny thing .
there 's studies that show you , there are studies that do n't show .
what is what is , is that coffee are <unk> in diabetes and so their metabolic performance improved .
and in the way , in the way , is also a good <unk> , because it could be able to show the <unk> , how we could show up with <unk> <unk> .
so a very nice nice and <unk> study had been studied for a hundred thousand people in a hundred thousand people have been shown in hundreds of years , and we 've been looking at a little bit of <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> their <unk> , to raise their <unk> .
this is a huge value for serious study .
and this applies to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but it 's not exactly the <unk> , right ?
they 're just going to give you , by <unk> , okay ?
but that 's not right .
so for peanuts , it 's not .
the next point is a little bit more difficult .
they avoid the recording to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only when they 're between <unk> and <unk> years .
so , a very nice new study is that they 're going to take a lot of animal protein to the <unk> protein , you have to raise your <unk> , when they would be a strong <unk> .
that 's not for time for the time where animal proteins are all , and it 's not for <unk> children or adolescents , the animal proteins need and do it , and it 's not for pregnant , and it 's not the ones that will be
they do n't avoid <unk> .
whatever you do , you 're going to go , you know , the <unk> nietzsche , who said , `` the <unk> , '' who said , `` the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> .
all <unk> is in the medical school .
this is the gentleman called <unk> <unk> , and he lived in this regime , and it 's been <unk> years old .
it comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never getting sick .
and he 's very good .
it 's not just a <unk> <unk> , but he 's living in a <unk> , where there 's a lot of healthy <unk> .
he followed about the <unk> , which i told you today .
we should not be interested in all the <unk> of the most important fact , but we do n't see it .
so , because the <unk> of the <unk> is not a biological system , but it seems to be a <unk> , and eventually a <unk> .
you know , you 're less less less than that , and could be one of the <unk> mistakes of our culture .
<unk> wrote the largest novel of the <unk> , a year ago .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece of work on the contemporary critic of all the teenage <unk> <unk> .
i thank you for your attention .
i 'm going to start with a question i want to you .
one question , where do n't you have to get up because it 's a little bit of a <unk> who is lonely ?
the <unk> is very little .
lower than i thought .
but it probably has no reasons why they did n't have been reported , and the people who would have been <unk> .
a lot of people have <unk> and loneliness and they would be <unk> .
that 's not the case .
you 're going to see in <unk> , in fact , is a phenomenon of humans as alone .
perhaps it 's also because it 's not that you do n't have signed because the question is going to be <unk> .
you feel like a lonely , or is you lonely ?
you can feel lonely , without being a lonely .
and you can be able to feel like a lonely moment in the moment .
and loneliness to do a lot of shame .
also , also , this is also going to have a couple of and <unk> to <unk> .
loneliness is in shame and shame in loneliness .
loneliness .
and so there 's no reported here now , in the few seconds that i gave you .
loneliness .
in loneliness , the time you need to be aware of all .
and loneliness and loneliness is also making it , too .
and this exercise is not going to do it .
we do n't have the language yet , and we have to realize the signs of ourselves , when are we lonely ?
there 's the loneliness of two <unk> that i 'm still in again .
one part of humanity says , it 's a start from lonely .
from birth to death , you 're actually lonely .
there are a few moments in the lives where you can the <unk> .
these people are going to go to <unk> and drive all the day .
i do n't have time , it 's like your <unk> .
and then there 's people who are not less high , who says everything is connected .
i 'm not really , so i 'm just one part of the big universe .
and there 's the big group of the group that i also have the most part of the time , so that 's so thinking .
and the idea , okay , today i am lonely and the next day , well , it 's hangs all together .
when we think of loneliness , all of the first loneliness is a lot of loneliness .
the loneliness of the <unk> , in the loneliness of the <unk> in a intensive care .
but about these <unk> , about these large <unk> <unk> , i do n't talk to you today , but i want to talk about the little , about everyday <unk> , where loneliness to be in such a theater .
i do n't want to talk about burden and <unk> .
loneliness at other people , most of them is not difficult to us in our <unk> to us to be detected .
photographer christine <unk> <unk> did a few photos i want to show you .
how easy it is always going to be in other loneliness .
now we do n't know if these people felt really lonely in this moment .
but who does n't know what it 's not , the moment on this <unk> event where you think , all you talk to each other , you 're something lost in the corner and has no one .
these all of all right now , in spite of loneliness .
maybe some you might have experienced today .
what you do is to do it , you know , you 're looking at the cell phone <unk> , but that could see the <unk> of the cell phone , which is the <unk> on the cell phone .
clearly , when you look at the display .
what we do n't do here now .
and then , and then there 's loneliness , which is in front of you , in the loneliness of a <unk> , hundreds of <unk> faces in front of you , and you 're not just going to leave something that you ca n't forget about your text .
these are the <unk> you see from the outside .
we give people to people .
but i 'm sure there 's another person in the room who are taught from birth to teach their entire life , by trying to get these loneliness .
and there are also in this room , and there 's also people who are also telling people who are lonely , because they have to take a different person because it 's because of the death of a <unk> .
there 's no idea that there 's no way that there are so many people , also , people who are connected to them , they 're connected to feel .
and there are people who have lost not to be able to find out of themselves , and they are taught .
i 'm betting the digital loneliness .
and sit down to the <unk> loneliness .
the analog loneliness is not familiar .
these are people who think of their belief in social contacts .
it 's still a relative .
there 's no official number , no <unk> number , when someone else has enough to be .
and there 's the old people immediately .
it 's the <unk> form of loneliness .
since since we have all in cities , and we have a lot of people in facebook or facebook , or facebook , it 's got to be bigger and more loneliness .
you can be connected with hundreds of people without being connected to a single person .
is it in the analog , rather than the data of human relationships , it 's missing in the digital loneliness .
the two forms of loneliness are very often against each other .
it 's also about that , the analog to occur in a little bit of a little bit more <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness is good for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's the <unk> of the digital loneliness in the future , if you get more likely to get the opportunities to connect .
i do n't know if you 're in six years of this sense of what 's going to be very similar to a loneliness .
or if you find a new term .
but these are also the issues of the <unk> generation .
almost greater than loneliness , the fear of loneliness and from this fear of loneliness are not people happy .
<unk> , the big <unk> , also , a <unk> person , <unk> wrote a wonderful <unk> .
in the act of what people are doing , what people do n't do to be alone .
they build cathedrals , and they 're the witnesses who are lonely and they are lonely .
but the <unk> did n't call to <unk> the fear of loneliness , which is money .
<unk> go .
things be in .
both the process of all over the right now , because it 's at least a touch , as well , the things that makes a touch as well as the objects that you have stolen .
problem is that it helps it , and it 's going to be that <unk> against the loneliness .
so we have to buy new things , and we have to buy new things .
i 've seen the commercials for a <unk> heart attack .
and the <unk> of the <unk> are <unk> communication with the idea of it .
and what that 's doing is to do with your panties , you do n't know , but it seems to work .
so loneliness to do n't have to do with the <unk> , especially in people , right ?
<unk> <unk> wrote a wonderful poem , and there 's a verse on the worst that 's loneliness .
hand on the heart , who knows that ?
in a relationship or looking at the other or the other hand , and all of the sudden , and all of the sudden , being very terrible alone , you know , terrible and wonder , who 's this person actually ?
i 've got to do with anything ?
one study says that in the <unk> women are about the <unk> , married , married , with kids , feel .
this is missing , because i do n't know about whether i invented the study of the study as often i 've told them .
but it 's also not all right now , because at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least in studies , it 's mostly anyway , and the response is the same thing that people are in front of me .
that 's what the implications of of it is , almost a <unk> .
in loneliness to <unk> , every <unk> and still do n't talk about it .
talk about the <unk> of loneliness .
it 's probably all experienced that .
even while you have a sudden , suddenly , what i think are i actually doing here ?
who is this person in my bed ?
also , the shape of loneliness to do n't necessarily have to do something to do with the quality of the <unk> .
but nothing also has to do with the quality of the quality .
it 's just always there .
we 're just talking about them because we do n't look at it .
we 're not talking about it in the workforce .
in the workforce , loneliness is too <unk> as we think .
i stood up with <unk> <unk> , and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better , three remarks suit , and two carrying <unk> .
the two men have taught who have both women have been entertained .
and in between , something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in the hand of the <unk> .
i think i 've got to give you the scene in the top of you , and you know , there 's a little bit of loneliness that everyone has already lived in his workforce .
it 's the loneliness of the <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness of the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see here , maybe there 's some of these lives in <unk> .
in <unk> , in hotels , in hotels , in hotels , in hotels , in <unk> , in <unk> , they 're <unk> who do n't know , you do n't know , who they actually do .
where they 're going to wake up .
it 's also a form of loneliness , which is not spoken to .
it 's just as <unk> as loneliness .
<unk> is parallel .
i 've told me a <unk> story that he was called by a clients , and the said , it 's what happens , you ca n't imagine it .
a <unk> was in the state alone .
so he has the <unk> .
and two months later , it 's also <unk> .
the loneliness is never going to be alone .
it 's always going to be connected with other emotion .
she 's nice siblings , and she has ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings we all know .
fear , grief of everlasting despair and shame .
but we should not forget the beautiful siblings .
the freedom of the pride is the desire to the <unk> .
so , my plea to look at the loneliness .
come and goes in the lives like the tide and the tide .
let them go and do n't go from her .
because there 's a little bit worse than loneliness and that 's the blank , which may be more likely to fall more .
loneliness is part of life .
for me , i 've been thinking so much about loneliness .
one in my <unk> , i did n't know how a <unk> dictator , i realized that i did n't have a <unk> , because he did n't have <unk> because i thought i would have to lose the people , i 'd be able to be <unk> .
i 've been invented since i 've been able to have the loneliness to my life , and let me go to people .
that 's what it is with the <unk> that you do .
i grew up there , and i 'm free .
people are going to go and go to <unk> , they do n't get back in the process , whether it was a friendship or a friendship or a partnership .
as a kid , i found my parents very embarrassing .
you can not have a conversation with a conversation without going on with somebody else .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
each time , it led to <unk> talks .
as a kid , i found myself as a kid .
and as a young adult , i 've been documenting it incredibly to have this openness .
but only since i 've ever since loneliness , at least , at least , you know , and again , i 'm going to be able to open up and open up .
you 're going to be able to be able to be able to feel for a game .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i 've got three instances of this .
a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now i 'm going to say , you know , if you 're just accessing the <unk> , you know ?
most of them would choose to choose for the <unk> .
and that 's a very good idea .
and why ?
because of the least effort , we have the largest effect on the most important effect .
in health , we do it kind of different .
and so let 's work there with the largest effect , except for eight strategies .
for example , we choose to give us for the <unk> and the cartoon .
big <unk> , but it 's great effort .
so i 'm not so valuable .
or we decide to the <unk> .
it 's diet .
but also very big <unk> , but still very big effort .
and so i do n't have that valuable .
and i want to tell you what you 're doing with the least effort of the world 's largest <unk> .
when you get in prevention and health , you 're not going to go to a topic .
and the theme is called <unk> .
and it 's not a subject in germany , so about the <unk> .
and then , the number of overweight overweight in germany , has grown in germany .
and i asked me , what was there in the <unk> ?
so why did the <unk> all of up ?
and then i grew up in research and i grew up too <unk> .
because it was in the years .
what was there ?
there was <unk> <unk> .
and we are always going to be more and more .
and i looked at the way .
<unk> comes from germany to germany .
and the obesity increase .
and in the years , the curve is still going to go on .
and what 's going to come up ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how it 's called everything .
and we are always going to be more and more .
well , i got one and a <unk> .
because it was obvious .
sports , dick .
and of course , i 'm not here today , to tell you that sports is thick .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we have in common .
and the tide of new training , and they did n't have to be <unk> that we 're going to be <unk> and healthier .
so what is it then ?
diet ?
and there 's a lot of great study in the states .
the problem with syndrome .
and they 've launched in the <unk> <unk> .
and then they wanted to look at what 's happening here ?
and they 've seen the people actually have less fat , but they 're still getting less calories , but still more .
and that was paradox .
and so they 've called it called <unk> .
we can explain that ?
there are you allowed to imagine the power like a power station .
there 's so serious <unk> .
and on the one side , one comes a <unk> , there 's all the whole <unk> who 's going down here .
and here is the energy <unk> as electricity .
but if we 're going to give more <unk> in our power plant than we use on the other side , the energy in power and it 's got bang .
the human body does n't be the same .
the energy can store .
and this is in a <unk> of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
but what happens when we 've got less like a little bit like we 've heard of energy , and yet , even though , it 's going to be the end of it , it 's going to be a conclusion .
the <unk> are dramatically <unk> .
and there 's no life happening at all .
we are only mobile .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents were <unk> at six kilometers to foot ran .
and we 're going to get a bit of a until two miles and these are the positive estimates .
there are studies that report on five -- to <unk> meters .
i 'm telling you a little bit of my friend mike ,
give me a degree of the chair ?
mike , are you a level of level ?
mike is americans .
he 's shy , he 's not talking a lot .
and he was at this study and sitting here .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he 's got a <unk> in the hand .
and mike is always less and less and less and less and less and it 's still <unk> , and still it 's always <unk> and more .
why ?
because mike is just sitting on .
and i watched a little bit like <unk> mike , and he gave him a <unk> back in the pocket , and i got <unk> .
and there 's a thousand steps .
this was so the distance that mike talks about the morning in the middle of the car in the office with the car in the office , of course , of course , there 's a little bit of coffee and back back .
and he came to a thousand steps .
this is mike , mike 's 10 minutes on his day .
<unk> hours , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
under these conditions , disease comes from alone .
and mike is not going to be incredibly <unk> , because it 's too much food because so long as long , it 's not as long , but not as long energy , but not as long , but not as long , it 's not as much more and energy <unk> .
and first of the power , the energy , like you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , there 's not there .
the <unk> at some of the <unk> are <unk> .
and also , she 's active and <unk> and quiet on his <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so when the energy <unk> into blood , the doctors are <unk> <unk> and high <unk> .
and that <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , it 's like <unk> , <unk> holes in these <unk> .
and a happiness is , there 's the whole fat of the fat and the <unk> are now going to be in these little wounds and we 're talking about <unk> or <unk> .
and now , <unk> heart is very much lower , because now he has to get the blood through these tight <unk> <unk> , and we talk about blood pressure .
and if this pressure is , then , it 's a <unk> , then it 's <unk> .
and when the heart happens , we call the heart attack .
and if that 's happening in the head , we call the stroke .
and in germany , the second person dying of heart attacks and stroke .
that means , in germany , every second is in <unk> .
and <unk> is not going to be sick because it 's not going to be a sports , but it 's not going to go .
and if you do n't know these things , then you 're going to look at the wrong place .
for example , for instance , diet .
i 've got a little bit of dieting , the diet of amazon , and there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if each book is just as a centimeter , and we would be <unk> , we would have a 30 meter of <unk> <unk> .
and i read the read for you all .
and there 's there , and this is really important if you 're going to consume more energy than they use , then they 're going to use them .
and if you get less energy than you use it , they 're going to be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why do we need a lot of books ?
that 's just a conclusion .
now , the need is , of course , is there 's huge , but it 's not aid .
because why is a diet to a diet of a diet ?
because it 's a diet , and no lifestyle .
what are you going to do the issues that we do three weeks and here , five weeks ago , when we go to this struggle , going to the regular day , to our regular lifestyle .
what 's going to be five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except for <unk> and again , the self-confidence that we did n't have done again , what we did .
so you 're allowed to go back in every new diet , in each new <unk> , and you want to integrate in your everyday lives in their lifestyle .
yeah , or no ?
and then , when you go .
and if no , they 're just going to remain it .
because when the end of the night is not pure local .
it 's the habits that are choosing whether we 're getting sick or healthy .
it 's the bad habits that are getting sick .
and it 's the good habits that are healthy .
and when mike in the mirror , it looks like the result of his daily lifestyle .
when mike looks in the mirror , it looks there his everyday habits .
and when mike 's <unk> in the mirror , and it 's too honest , and then he looks like it 's going to go .
because when he 's more bad habits than good , he 's in the direction of the disease .
and when mike is going to be the direction of your goals , the dreams , then he does n't have to change his life .
and then he just need to be good habits than bad .
and a <unk> habits <unk> <unk> is a great example of that person is a weird animal .
mike has done it , for example , it 's completely <unk> by his day-to-day life by <unk> with the car , using each <unk> .
and at night , he 's <unk> on the couch , and somehow it needs to come from movement .
so he sits down in his <unk> path , and it 's going to be called <unk> , which is a <unk> , and then it 's <unk> <unk> , and then it 's going to be a <unk> , again , it 's kind of to come to movement .
and my grandpa have had exactly the same as well as you .
and there was a farmer and that did n't understand that .
they were told , sports is for people who do n't move .
and somehow he 's right .
so why do we have to learn to night in our precious hand , what we 've lost in your everyday life ?
we 've got to do with this <unk> lifestyle , two hours , a day .
now , it 's much easier to find the movement where we 've lost it .
in your day ,
and that 's why i 'm going to invite you to a point of a transformation .
you may also know the situation , you know , you 're looking at the situation , and you 're still going to go back at the first place , it 's not a place .
and you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , like a <unk> of this <unk> <unk> .
we 're going to want to go to the <unk> of the time .
we 're planning our homes so that we have the <unk> paths .
so we 're designing our whole life that we have the <unk> ways , but it 's not going to be there , but we do n't get there , where we <unk> .
it 's a very different direction .
that 's why you 're allowed to activate the <unk> , and they find the movement over there , where they came up .
so , i 'm going to drive to the track of the intersection .
and i 'm the only one that 's always high , and down , and down , and down , and go down , and all of the other are .
but when i 've been there , i 'm a time i 've got the time for me .
i mean , `` well , the movement is a movement that 's just sitting there .
and when of the top of the top comes down , 30 minutes of <unk> , i 'm telling .
<unk> steps .
these are about three times <unk> .
and a <unk> steps , if you go back every day , which is going to be more steps , which is that they 're going to <unk> 12 grams of fat in your body .
and maybe that may sound quite a little bit .
but as a <unk> , as a habit of <unk> days , then we 'll talk about four point five pounds of fat .
we do n't have in our bodies .
and you give me a degree of it , and i 'm always <unk> it .
the americans are crazy , you know , you know , the challenge here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds fat .
are the same for four pounds .
just you see what happens with these little steps .
and when the effect is from this perspective , which is what i mean , what happens when you 're going to be in a active life .
and these <unk> are going to go back every day in their day-to-day life .
once you have <unk> steps per day , they 're going to go to all of them .
and then you know , and when you do it , and they have the top of the top .
and then you 've fallen back to the <unk> .
they 're still getting faster and stronger .
but they do n't do their health care of sports .
so they do n't get their health care of your body and from her time .
because the most important most important thing that do you do every day as a lifestyle .
and i 'm going to <unk> a active lifestyle .
and for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , for me , it 's a <unk> decision to be a clear decision , and for me .
because i think it 's not to do with what we should do or do .
but it 's how to do with what we want to do .
and that 's why i 'm just one idea for you .
you 're just going to take the best .
and you know , you know how it 's .
step for step .
thank you very much .
<unk> , how did it have an leonardo da vinci , <unk> way to see the world with other eyes ?
and that 's how far on the circumstances , which just to be <unk> , is a little bit of <unk> ?
could we do something like this ?
now , maybe it might have to do what ?
and how can we express power and confidence for our future ?
so let 's start with the question , what do we actually understand innovation ?
sure .
technology 's innovations , even the official <unk> of the federal government , the administration is the title of the government .
so you know me right .
that 's all great .
and we can be very proud of it , and grateful that we have <unk> in such a fields that our <unk> are all over the world that it 's going to be good .
that is that we have such an extraordinary , unique wealth .
but what about the future ?
what are challenges , because of society ?
and who cares , because of the great environmental , and social challenges ?
so it seems to be kind of the end of the end .
it 's a kind of content .
so the economy , the economy of the future challenges , because the entrepreneurs then we have big effort in productivity and efficiency .
and the world are better going to do better in the nonprofit organizations and together and together and <unk> and <unk> , and then you have to have some of the other <unk> , of course , of course , to remove the damage of the world 's economy .
at least we repair repair .
but who says , because you have to look at all of these are so much like so different ?
how is it because if we bring our <unk> social and cultural dimension ?
now , if technological innovations also are cultural innovations ?
now , when economic innovations also are social innovations ?
when we have been able to think about this <unk> , and we sent to <unk> with the solution to the solution of big environmental and social challenges ?
so if it 's all the other things that are missing in isolation , and when there were a whole different , fair <unk> development ?
because it was ?
both sides were going to be what companies wanted ?
can we do this ?
you may be asking for you .
so far , we 've got this as a <unk> .
happiness is encouraging examples .
neurological yunus has been <unk> with his <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> in bangladesh to <unk> poverty .
and interestingly , in the direct <unk> , which is what the government <unk> did .
and he 's got <unk> as entrepreneurs , probably the nobel prize winner .
the opportunity there is , i 'm going to be able to make a <unk> in someone else .
and we can imagine , i 'm going to imagine <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the subtle guy .
<unk> are <unk> , but it 's also <unk> his ideal .
and yeah , it 's totally <unk> .
i 'd like to sound .
and if you see , you think , really , the offspring , we need to worry about our future .
well , in the university , he would have started to work somewhere in one of our <unk> <unk> .
and that 's what he does , too .
it 's called him , and it 's also a very successful .
and yet , there 's something like this .
so he asks , there 's no longer , that 's kind of in me ?
so , this the <unk> is going to tell you .
<unk> are in all <unk> .
and that also like him too .
and he was like this <unk> .
so there 's the right there in the <unk> , which has been discovered .
so not that he knows it personally , but so that 's what the <unk> says , it 's telling him .
and there in the middle of the t in the middle of the t he did n't know .
so , the more , it was surprised to him as a result , then it was to be presented to him with him as a <unk> .
as mister mister <unk> .
and as a <unk> entrepreneur , he showed up there .
so the it 's great pleasure , so with young people , his experience feeling .
and the two have shown two things .
and have been met .
how if we just do this in a particular talk about the two times ?
yeah , mister <unk> , so that was just .
what 's exactly the difference between the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
and i did n't know that .
yeah , so , then we 're going to begin with the question , what is <unk> <unk> ?
so , the name is , it 's already .
<unk> markets , developed products , developed clients , <unk> structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also be quite visible in which the big shapes are <unk> .
and once <unk> <unk> , even when it 's very <unk> , it 's also .
what 's a <unk> ?
so <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it
it 's something very different .
it 's a completely different character .
because there 's nothing like it .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
so of course , a little bit of a temporary organization that makes the purpose to find a business model , which is the profitable model , of course , that 's obvious , and then , it 's <unk> .
and you 're not going to understand that there 's a lot of the organization in which there are other ways of developing other ways , very different ways , very different ways .
yeah , that 's all of me .
but what are we looking at ?
so , i 'm going to go to you , you know , you know , you know , it 's a little bit of making money to make money or do it ?
so , i 've got out there , which fits quite well , so that 's very well in berlin , you would recommend me ?
this is called <unk> .
how do you make your business for <unk> and <unk> your life .
oh no .
real <unk> ?
what do you think you have their <unk> 30 money , what is your <unk> ?
so , then you <unk> a career as a <unk> , or what ?
what happens to your engagement , how do i know ?
and also , let 's look at the <unk> .
so the statistics are not going to give you a <unk> perspective , because you 've got a <unk> perspective because 70 percent of all <unk> are very few years after a lot of financial crisis as a lot of
money is always the outcome of a successful company and a good <unk> company .
clearly , money is a source of <unk> .
and it 's the basis of the ground for economic management assistance .
but it 's never the target of a company .
yeah , what is the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i get to go and learn , so no goal is no way of right .
and so , goals would have to be a lot of measurable and in order to be so on .
and if i do that , so , so , so i could n't have to have some of the things that i do n't have to know what i 'm looking for ?
so i do n't make a good sense .
so how do i want to decide , because you do , and risks and risks , it feels like all of it and <unk> .
yeah , <unk> welcome to the <unk> .
but i could have some of what you have .
a thread .
so that 's <unk> , so almost secret .
successful <unk> of generation <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , how do you say today ?
<unk> , i think , <unk> ?
so we 're still going to say that 's <unk> .
and if you 're in the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , strategic uncertainty .
so we 're going to help us .
i think i can give you one of you .
okay .
yeah , thank you , mister !
but there 's just the questions on it .
and that can be the same one of the most important danish qualities of the most important supply chain , to provide good questions .
can we get the back to one of the other , that maybe maybe it might be better ?
so the first one is , what am i here , and what do i make here ?
yeah , <unk> , there 's <unk> what 's moving on you , bigger than you ?
what are you doing on the world ?
what did people have people when you work with you ?
what are you ready ?
what are your inner , maybe not unconscious .
why is that important to find ?
because that 's the <unk> <unk> .
and how did we learn this ?
and if you do n't want to build a ship , the men are together with parts of wood , but they teach them , you know , desire to be a <unk> , <unk> ocean .
yes , good .
so i got the next questions .
what is my <unk> <unk> ?
what does that mean ?
yeah , you know , now , you can actually get your target .
in detail , in detail , but i 'm <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
do you know the story with the pink elephant ?
there 's a degree .
not ?
<unk> .
so , again .
you do n't give you a pink <unk> .
okay ?
does it work ?
so no pink elephant .
do that mean ?
no pink elephant .
you see ?
this is how we focus on what we do n't want .
what is the only way to have ?
there 's a <unk> ?
yeah , you know , wait , you know , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> on the <unk> .
but wait for you .
by the way , what you can do is , you know , right ?
i brought there .
you know , it 's <unk> , if you 're the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> smith .
who ?
at the end of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me to <unk> me to the time of the period of the time , <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i 'm going to talk about my <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> smith .
oh , what 's the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
it 's a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
and <unk> like it looks like ?
is what struck ?
has something changed ?
okay .
okay , the flower is too .
okay .
so let 's look at where the bear has remained .
and action .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> smith .
who ?
at the end of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me to <unk> the time of the period of the time in the time of the time , <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i 'm going to talk about my <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> smith .
and <unk> , how do you go ?
so i know , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i saw the first time .
i thought it could n't be it .
and yet , a lot of shocked , i was going to go through my head , it would be the whole time in the neighborhood ?
by my life .
and okay , i do n't understand it totally sense .
in the top of the top there , the immediate breast cancer is to avoid the immediate awareness of our perception and our <unk> first .
but what 's happening now ?
what i was and what i was and what i was doing is i ?
and that 's why , you know , you can see your perception of the perception of <unk> , is an important important <unk> quality .
well , yeah , thank you , then we go to the next question .
how could i get my goal ?
so , that 's what i think about good question .
and i 'm looking at that , and i do n't even know every time .
yes , <unk> , there 's good news for you .
so that 's going to be easier to fall , you might have been known as well .
because if you see your destiny , your inner code , and if you put a little bit of the <unk> , you know , i promise you to you , it 's going to happen in its own .
it 's almost automatically .
you 're not going to be different than that a brainstorming is going to happen to you .
these are the famous <unk> that you have in the shower in the morning .
and there 's a problem , i swear to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
and you have a big model .
and the <unk> have the terrific <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> , when the <unk> did n't know , in a <unk> , in florence .
for lunch , the famous big table .
and that 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politician , charity , <unk> engineers , architects , and he has a lot of intense <unk> .
but not in our sense of our senses , where it was in , yes , who 's going on ?
who 's right ?
but rather than all of these different <unk> things came out of these different types of things that would have been done in a way of which they could have done alone .
well , yeah , yeah , yeah , the next question is , what 's the concrete next step , i do ?
<unk> , there 's a successful entrepreneur in the cause of the reason .
instead of planning and management and so on the next step , it 's just just on the next step .
because what should you do in uncertainty ?
but the very determined , and with all the consequence .
and if it was n't it , you know , dan , you 're looking at <unk> other step .
and even if the big , lower , <unk> <unk> is n't it .
so it 's so important that you realize your thing .
that 's the inner safety .
and the rest of how did we have all of all of all of us ?
even though we did n't know that , and there 's no one said ?
you know , you know , you 're going to say there 's a little bit more intuitive to kids .
so , this rather rather , learning how to look like , and this kind of <unk> looks like , it 's fun for a company in a <unk> .
and that 's exactly the same thing that 's kind of the <unk> of the uncertainty that you are still getting upset .
yeah , thank you .
so that sounds really great .
but i do n't know , in the company , i think that there 's a lot of bosses have to change that anything .
and in fact , in germany , there 's always a common mood .
and i think , because the politicians have to worry about that .
okay , my boy , come on .
so how do it go down to the water .
what do you think how many people can do you ?
ten ?
tens of thousands ?
ten million ?
look at this .
who you see ?
right , that .
that 's the one you can change you to change .
or about mahatma gandhi , the change that you 're looking at in the world in you .
do you think beautiful words and great role models , but how does that work ?
there 's also a <unk> , we have to be <unk> in our <unk> .
helpful in all sorts of crises or if you feel like you , or when you feel a <unk> , and they all have to do with you .
and if you ask you in some situations what you 're going to say , and you 're going to say , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , what posture you can feed you to feel powerful to you .
ask you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , what you 're going to do with you , you know , you know , you know , you know you guys .
and at the end , ask you , ask you what you actually actually have about this crisis or what 's bad is happening .
so i mean , if it 's going to happen to you , you know , it 's worth about it .
yes .
<unk> <unk> .
and do you think that 's really really helpful to my <unk> path ?
yes .
and you see two things .
first of the first time , the repetition of your inner body is that , then you go to your expertise .
because your perception is .
and the second dog is on your inner attitude to you .
because it 's like you like the other people to behave .
the future is only going to change your own perception .
you know ?
yeah , i think you have .
thank you , so , i 'm going to do it .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what do you think about our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how are we going to be it in this <unk> ?
is that a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
all right .
so i see all the <unk> .
<unk> is called <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> really is really .
a <unk> of the <unk> .
and no , new <unk> , <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
it 's just a long time in the great famous name .
robert bosch , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
let 's just <unk> this mind .
and who may have stopped from our <unk> of our history of our time .
you can see , i 'm <unk> .
so maybe it would be <unk> that i 'm going to talk with kids and the future , because of course , children are our future .
instead , this is the view of the most of the most of the most of the most of the time .
i have a great my life in prison .
four years ago , my father , and i was making the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for <unk> .
we 're <unk> <unk> , which means that you can either be able to make any mobile phone or find a piece of online , and then they can make a piece of work , and then they can also give you a piece of work .
so why are i doing me to <unk> <unk> , so those who failed are made the great mistakes ?
our program is not far as easy to understand how the programs are the kids .
and in fact , i thought that the <unk> of the last place in the universe is in the universe , in which i would work .
what do you think is the most important missing factor in the childhood that we work with ?
we 've found out there are positive models , often <unk> positive models .
and if you think about why there 's a lot of <unk> and so many <unk> and so many <unk> are often that he did n't have a reasonable work in the prison , and that he would be drugs in prison .
and if you find a <unk> boy about what he wants to do from his life , he might have no better idea how a different life could look like , because it does n't have better role models .
and he <unk> his father .
i 'm just looking at martin .
martin is <unk> of our program .
his dad was an alcoholic , and he made the whole family to the hell .
when he was 12 , his mother had died and he and his little brother had to go into the home .
there was the <unk> of the great .
he was shy and <unk> and so the perfect victim .
until his day , when it was a little brother of a soccer football , that 's the ground on the ground .
and there was <unk> at martin times , he went to the enemy and he found .
and from this day , he was respects .
and so it was walking .
violence was part of the day in his life , right ?
how about the person i 'm just described , right ?
after childhood , a lot of youth are a lot of unemployed or have <unk> .
they do n't know much other than their illegal activity and their <unk> .
and then you 'll fall a day in jail in prison where they 're in the prison , which is that the idea of the same spin are not a better role models .
what do you think these people are in common ?
most good .
and they 're going to be better criminals in the <unk> .
they sell drugs to a higher level and plan in the fall where they could be in the fall of sleep .
and then that leads to germany to <unk> percent .
that 's called in germany , every <unk> criminal criminals are <unk> .
but there 's also people in prison that would really want to change .
but these people also carry on the forehead .
and there is <unk> .
and everywhere you get your first identity .
whether you 're looking for a workplace , whether they 're looking for a apartment , whether they want to build new private relationships , you 're going to be able to have an idea of that led to society in society .
this is the problem we are .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what are the quality , do you have a lot of <unk> ?
you 're going to be surprised .
it 's <unk> capabilities .
who 's got a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> from <unk> and <unk> .
you know , the topic is , it 's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of <unk> , otherwise he did n't have in jail .
these are the traits that we want to be with something positive .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three <unk> .
we are connecting the basics of entrepreneurship and economies .
everybody 's subjects who write his own <unk> , and everyone is going to be a <unk> part of the <unk> .
and then we 're going to talk to the <unk> in the fall of the <unk> in the <unk> of their personal relationships and also in a different <unk> .
what about <unk> do this program ?
it 's a big range of the <unk> to the agency .
we have a <unk> .
so a very large range of bandwidth , and i 'd like to introduce you to introduce you to injury .
<unk> <unk> and his illusion of the <unk> money , have been a <unk> .
he was always fun to run business .
he 's got arrested for the first time .
and this lady is not quite impressed with this .
in the opposite .
he says today , he 've been prepared for the end of the day .
it 's <unk> for the second time .
and then he took a therapy for a therapy , and then the <unk> .
and there was how he learned how to be a <unk> talent for something to be a little bit more mature .
he 's been <unk> in september 13 , then october his agency .
the agency is going to be right now , and he can have life .
he worked very good <unk> .
he 's with me today .
who wants to do that , you want to talk to him .
even back to martin , from the beginning i had told him .
martin 's got to be a education , and i ended up a education , and he ended up in his spare time in the <unk> .
and there 's alcohol and drugs on the agenda , it was pretty close to the <unk> .
he was working with parallel and <unk> .
he ran this life .
and he says , today , it 's not going to be the lifestyle of this lifestyle .
one day , he injured someone in a <unk> , so hard that he was convicted .
he took the most part of the <unk> and the <unk> has changed there .
he learned how to make more force and more of the quality of quality of life without being able to consume his air .
and he was about his insights to be <unk> that he had to pass this to it .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
this was the idea .
now , he 's going to work on two years , and <unk> our subjects on the way , because he knows that if you want to change in the way , and if you want to change the right tools with the hand , it 's often
the basis of these successes are in the way , by the way , are people like you .
people who come in prison , the <unk> are going to talk to the <unk> with us with us to <unk> our participants in their <unk> .
these are our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our teaching , these are students who are students who are students , <unk> <unk> .
and these are our mentors who are playing with our participants in the sleep .
and also , these people also take a lot of our program .
one example .
we 're doing a little bit of a conversation called a practice called <unk> .
and we put in the middle of the space in the middle of the space , a big <unk> of our subjects are on the one and our people on the other side .
and then i 'll ask you different questions .
and every time , when somebody in the room , he 's answered this question .
and here 's what we 're all in common , whether we 're in the prison , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and one example of where the differences are , is the following question .
i grew up in a `` social social <unk> , or i had a family which was in custody .
there are a lot of our participants in front of the line , and very few of our people .
one question i like to make all the link to all of us all together , i love to give you a question .
so i 'm going to get you all at all up .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see it .
it 's all .
terrific .
thank you .
i 'm going to give you a question , and if you do n't answer this question , you 're just going to stand up .
this is kind of our line that we 're doing now .
i 've done in my life in my life of illegal things that i could have been punished but not .
if you 're the question , you 're going to answer the answer to you .
and there 's no way to be the car .
and that 's also , perhaps , perhaps a lot of <unk> .
and there 's no <unk> .
okay .
and there 's also also , maybe each trial is not going to have been really <unk> .
all right .
most of them are sitting .
we have a few angels in the room .
this is wonderful , there i am glad .
thank you , you can get rid of them all over again .
now , in this question , if we 're looking at the events , our people come in , and we 're often excited .
and there 's also clear how much happiness might have happened .
happiness with parents , happiness with the environment , in the environment , in the environment , with the friends , but also also also also luck to the friends , but also also also luck they had n't always been caught in the friends , if you 've done something on the edge of the <unk> or beyond it .
what are the results of our work ?
by <unk> percent of our alumni , from the <unk> days after their <unk> , a piece of music .
so that 's rapidly fast .
<unk> percent have already done in each other .
a third of the donors are <unk> in the past year .
and our <unk> is in seven percent .
i 've already said that the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany .
i am retired .
a <unk> cost into <unk> per year , <unk> dollars a year .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , which is a <unk> of seven percent of a <unk> , usually percent of a <unk> .
when my father and i 've started designing the <unk> , we 've been a open very crazy for quite very crazy .
i 've given my great <unk> in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i did n't have a <unk> work .
we encourage our participants in taking responsibility .
and responsibility , what happened in your life is and in all of it will happen in your life .
not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new self and allows it to build the trust .
and that 's why it 's really happy , and i 'm going to give me a pride of your subjects on their way .
so , i brought you a little video .
film .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months ago , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> against the <unk> , and 10 months .
i traded the <unk> .
so , i have judgment from two years , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation , my whole range is actually changed my complete life .
and what was important for me was this <unk> , which is also done .
because i was , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , <unk> , i 'm sure , yes .
i 've got back of goals .
and i found out of perspective back .
and you 're going to go with a very different awareness and self-confidence from the fall .
and there 's more and more <unk> goals , and then you 're still going to go to anything else .
with the wrong people , and there 's not anymore .
well , the problem is that a lot of things do n't have a <unk> , when they get out .
so the biggest problem because it 's automatically <unk> , you get the old <unk> .
you do n't know anything else .
and by this <unk> individual individual , no matter , which is not to have me just my whole thing about myself , about the whole way of myself in other , about the problems of the problems , about society that was just as a <unk> .
i 've been having a little kid in my first woman .
and for the age of six months , i 'm going to go back with her together .
so that means we started a new relationship .
and because i 've also have a whole bunch of the <unk> and many other things that have changed .
i 've done a lot .
i 've started with my family in the <unk> .
so i work in my life today , i 'm telling you .
i 'm just looking at a <unk> <unk> .
you have to recognize that , you know that there are very , very many people actually have , actually , in fact , my mentor , are also going to be over the period of time , and in fact , i do n't know , i do n't know ,
i 'm grateful for that they 've got to the idea that they do .
i 'm grateful for you , and i 've got a lot of difficulty , and i 'm extremely grateful that i could be part of it .
of course , of course , the whole people who were support , they were involved .
i 've talked like a lot of people who were talking about the <unk> , and i always <unk> me , and that 's good , do it .
and that 's why i 'm going to do it .
and tell you , thank you .
come in the prisons .
each of you have something we can need .
whether you were looking at our participants in their <unk> , whether they 're going to be as a <unk> of us , whether it 's in a financial support .
whether you want to carry our program in a new <unk> , very <unk> .
let 's talk to me .
martin poetry and i are today .
and look at the conversation with you .
thank you .
<unk> <unk> , i was <unk> <unk> in nepal .
in a time i was <unk> at a time .
there you do things like that .
for <unk> island .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the <unk> .
there are really a lot of opportunities to deal with <unk> .
you know how to be <unk> .
anyway , i was <unk> <unk> .
and with my work , and so little <unk> .
so i have to talk about <unk> .
and not from real problems .
my problem was , i was <unk> , and i could be right , and my life was looking like my life , 30 years , 30 years .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> , i found scary .
and to give up the <unk> .
in fact , i had an <unk> problem of crisis .
good like private .
i just did n't want to go to the <unk> journey ?
do you feel comfortable ?
or what if i throw my <unk> back to again ?
and look at what happens .
what you 're waiting for me .
that 's the idea .
i was in this time <unk> <unk> at a <unk> .
as i said , `` <unk> . ''
and the <unk> was also <unk> in the absolute life .
and you <unk> the world for the world in very good hotels and <unk> the country in a very granular way .
but also , also , very <unk> countries .
and developing countries where there are more likely to tell you more and say about <unk> villages of <unk> local local local people , even though they do n't have so much happiness and joy .
and this is exactly of these images and <unk> lives , but a <unk> also in a certain way .
and that was me for me for a while .
i was doing what i did .
on the surface .
and also , i found a little bit of writing from me to write a country that i actually actually do n't really know .
i wanted to change .
i wanted to know the countries right .
and to write articles to write articles .
and to finish my personal interest .
how do you learn better ?
by people , you live with people .
people are living in you home .
not in the hotel .
by looking at the challenges and with the issues of people .
and by people , you work with people .
at least , the answer was that i could give me on this question .
and that 's what i wanted to do .
and also , i wanted to do something of a job .
i wanted to afford a contribution .
something good .
and this sense of this feeling has been <unk> in a <unk> of food .
and i was in the developing countries , but nepal was just <unk> me just very little .
until <unk> , there 's a <unk> civil war in which there 's not only one of the <unk> and social problems left .
with a year , one annual average of average of <unk> dollars is nepal in south asia .
and it 's still going to continue to have the two poorest countries of the world .
one quarter of the population lives below poverty .
almost a fifth of the population are suffering from malnutrition .
forty percent of the adults ca n't read and write .
all these facts connected with many personal stories , and these things that i 've met in this journey i met in a time in a time in a time in a time i was ready and open to change .
in the same way i wanted to do something .
and for example , after my return of nepal , my decision , my decision to work .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me in the aid .
and i 'm also going to <unk> a little bit of the answer to the answer i got on my job .
because she was just a <unk> .
it 's about a serious idea of <unk> international 's international .
and not about a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> , you want to live , and you want to go to nepal .
hello ?
is it ?
my job was really serious , and good .
at least , i thought that .
and these answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really <unk> .
and , of course , one funny answer was written .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
so instead , i 've got to be a lot of intense feeling about what good <unk> .
i used it as a motor to give my own business .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
a company essentially basically what i 've been looking for .
and that 's the possibility of traveling a country differently .
the possibility of a country right right .
by the way that i live in the people , and work .
and there 's not somewhere in the way , but in <unk> <unk> .
you can dissect the way up with two words .
so , <unk> and <unk> .
so that means how much of the place you can gather good <unk> .
you can do a good thing .
this sounds like this sounds little bit more <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social business business .
we use tourism to be a tool for sustainable development .
and we use a little bit of communication to sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and tourism .
because the people who travel with us are useful in their talk .
they pay for their journey , how to another trial .
but they just travel .
they live in <unk> .
and the idea is not a lot of recovery or more <unk> , but there 's real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
in the way of the students , our students ever come in the <unk> and interests in different projects .
we can have an <unk> <unk> in the world of areas that otherwise otherwise otherwise be a chance of <unk> tourism .
because it 's the infrastructure that 's missing is that it 's missing .
we can promote sustainable projects .
we can <unk> our sustainable projects and finance .
so we 're investing in a hundred percent of ourselves .
they do n't rely on donations .
and that 's just for our long-term <unk> engagement .
we started with our work in nepal .
we 've got our engagement in uganda <unk> .
and over over four years , i turned to get married , and my husband and i are a <unk> question .
let 's go to the <unk> way ?
or what if we think about it ?
when we do n't think about the <unk> ?
if we do n't have social engagement and sustainable travel , and development in its wholeness ?
and also the individual <unk> ?
or even more detailed individual <unk> .
that would be a new company .
a company , which is <unk> .
but with other things , the same philosophy like <unk> .
do we want this ?
was the next question .
<unk> new companies ?
we want that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're just <unk> .
because we talk the same language .
because we dream the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and that 's why we have an sister given a sister .
<unk> .
and with <unk> , we promote a creative company in their development and <unk> <unk> that we have to support in <unk> people .
and with some of the participants , governments , entrepreneurs or collaborator from creative companies with individual development goals .
so the personal social and <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> .
and they 're going to prepare for the <unk> .
there are also <unk> in <unk> .
one of the effort to a meaningful <unk> movement has another advantage .
he 's looking at a long time in where you are , or where you <unk> .
where you might have even more damaging biases .
where you might have a little bit more flexible , to think about it .
and he 's showing you what you 're really good .
it 's going to be a <unk> .
it 's the creativity that all of the sudden is great .
or it 's the equanimity that you find new into it .
the physical things we can do n't want to do you can not change on .
and the power to change things you can change .
and you can change very much .
in very short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are <unk> rose <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
these are five wonderful women from uganda .
<unk> , <unk> and talent .
they put beautiful beautiful , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and we did n't have happened for years .
because they did n't have a market .
because they did n't know how to improve quality .
because nobody said , which is the design of the question .
we wanted to help these women .
and so that 's why in this year , also a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products from poverty .
you give you a income .
one future is .
we went back with our <unk> live .
and we start with a <unk> <unk> .
one <unk> <unk> of a thousand <unk> of our women .
it 's not just a year for a year .
but it allows us to make a lot more bigger .
this first <unk> is kind of social space <unk> and <unk> .
so who wants to support , you can do it with a piece of management to the other , but he can also travel directly to the project .
he can travel , and he can travel to the women , and they 're <unk> .
we do n't want to be just a little bit of in the long term , we do n't want to give up five women , or from a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but in nepal , and in other <unk> , in which we work <unk> .
but that <unk> is just a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we work in all the central areas .
in the realm of <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work is in just a area too .
what happens to the children when women work ?
right .
so we started in nepal and in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , and in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda ,
it 's all in our cycle .
and the whole power is more sense than each of each project .
you know , people are going to place the <unk> in the different projects .
and that 's what we 're going to have a lot of opportunities , and they 're always going to get in the common work .
and finally , i 'd like to take a journey on a journey .
and i 'm going to close your eyes .
reset you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're standing on a wooden dining room .
and they 're happy and tired .
you 've just stopped with your <unk> .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
there 's plenty of warm .
you <unk> the window .
and they 're looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand .
you <unk> your <unk> .
also , there 's a thin layer of the <unk> .
the kids laughing .
and i call your <unk> .
you 're not going to call you a little bit more <unk> .
<unk> .
you do n't know how late it is .
but soon , you 'll get up .
and the <unk> , on the moment , the kids were going on , <unk> .
at the end of the street , a big tree .
here you 're going to meet you with <unk> .
in the meadow , in the <unk> of the tree , you 'll get the new designs of their <unk> .
you are going to talk about hands and feet .
later , the other women come to .
they smile you .
until you talk to your english language .
under the tree .
free .
remarkably , there 's the internet .
tomorrow 's <unk> with your coach .
you 're going to get you .
exchange is valuable .
it 's also nice to talk to german .
you <unk> music .
and the <unk> of <unk> .
mama <unk> <unk> <unk> in the courtyard .
she sings a african song .
you 're a <unk> and happy .
you can do the eyes .
each of us can give us the <unk> in a new context .
or at least , at least a short time , the cube is going to be new .
and you see what happens .
thank you .
before i start , i would have interested in whether it 's the night that you are here , somebody 's shoes have been going to work on .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i 'm not going to do that light right now , but maybe someone wants to be your hand .
here 's the bottom of the <unk> .
two .
now , here 's <unk> , i do n't know , but in every case there is two , which is beautiful , we 've already <unk> .
and i 've also drawn a building , and that 's the <unk> mountain in the east of the city .
that 's the building .
and with six people i 've been working on , i 've been working on the last summer age six months .
and so i 'm telling you tonight .
well , you might say some of you .
what is it ?
<unk> are a lot .
but i want to explain to it .
oh , what 's the <unk> now ?
and the <unk> in park or how ?
just one little selection of the questions , who known us , who have been <unk> , colleagues who have experienced is that i 'm part of a initiative i 've got to deal with a initiative that i 'm part of a initiative that i 'm going to give up with a initiative i 've got to say , a lot of names , <unk> .
and all of the time we had <unk> in the series of <unk> <unk> .
and here 's a <unk> called <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and the privatization of the privatization of it looks like this .
but who who know , that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was not the elected <unk> of the initiative .
what we see here is a plaque from the <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> .
this is a public space , which is private , and that 's why not for many people , i do n't say , `` do n't in public hand , and that 's not as a way that you can use public spaces .
we were a group of <unk> in the desire with <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell another <unk> .
we were a <unk> team , and i 've got to find a little bit of , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the fields of architecture , urban social , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
of course , with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspective and <unk> .
and we have allowed us to provide a different skills , but also , in different networks .
and a creative part of <unk> solutions in the <unk> , which we have done is that we did .
we have actually navigated to <unk> the <unk> .
however , it was about the <unk> of the stories and ideas .
and we asked them to memory and images .
and from these memories and images , it 's trying to provide possible perspectives for the <unk> .
it was really important to us that the process has always been constructive .
and we have an initiative that we have to have a <unk> tool , and as a <unk> .
this was a <unk> and emotional seat , and she became a <unk> .
on the experiences we 've done , `` i 'm going to talk about it tonight .
every city has grown places .
there 's a face .
and in many cases , these were <unk> and <unk> , and they 're seeing in the consequences of citizens as foreign places .
they 're the dead places of a city because they do n't find a lot of the way that we expect in a public space .
so for example , for example , we have <unk> , <unk> .
they 're going to get these , but also the fact , the public places , is often <unk> .
initiatives that want to be living in the day they 're going to find these places , and they 're often <unk> interest in the infancy .
and what has to do with me to do with me , like some questions , i like some other questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places are not just a face .
no .
they 're the social places of our city , in the <unk> lives .
and so we 're going to do a lot of the first <unk> ties in our neighbors , when we 're going to run us to the way .
and can this fit , when we have a serious way to sit , and actually , in fact , in fact , when the spaces are also designed to the spaces .
and we 're just getting more interested in the way .
it 's related to each other , sometimes .
but that 's a feeling of community .
now , the more part of the things i 've got in such a public space , the faster and the more , it 's also a lot of the community .
and if i 'm not <unk> , then you see what you 're going to call the goliath of a big city .
we were two challenges ago .
we can be aware of the citizens of consciousness , responsibility , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood or <unk> in <unk> .
how does the mint be transformed into creation ?
how can anyone be transformed in ideas ?
protest against the privatization and <unk> of these <unk> places , and the <unk> against the scale , and actually not quite <unk> the same places .
now , imagine you 're sitting here , you 're sitting here , once you beat the newspaper and read next text .
love <unk> and citizens , we invite you to give you a three potential varieties for the <unk> of the <unk> , which is called <unk> <unk> .
they 're allowed to skip the idea of the idea .
and the alternative to the most <unk> <unk> is then <unk> .
would you go ?
would anyone who go to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds just great .
there 's a kind of possibility of what <unk> .
you can get to <unk> , how this looks in the future .
and as i said , it sounds great for the first moment .
i think of a explanation .
and that 's because i 'm not allowed to be involved in the way , or choose or accountability , <unk> .
first , it 's a lot of <unk> <unk> too late .
now , that 's mostly , you do n't have a opportunity to have a opportunity , really , to make a little bit of ideas , but there 's actually a design of design , and they 're actually going to choose whether they 're not going to decide whether they 're still <unk> or <unk> in the urban green green environment .
or , as a friend recently said , which is the color is the trash of the trash .
second explanation , <unk> <unk> 's <unk> 's information and voting .
think about three <unk> varieties .
we have what we want to show you , and you can give them to be able to vote .
frustration and <unk> are often the consequences of what i find out .
i do n't want to make a decision about <unk> or <unk> , if i actually had a <unk> , rather than <unk> <unk> .
but it 's also different .
even though , the <unk> of the people who have spent a lot of talk about , and we have to learn a lot of <unk> .
and that 's how we took experiences and i want to share with another <unk> .
i 'd like to share it to other <unk> , other projects , but of all of the city school and policy .
because these are the ones that are actually going to have these <unk> and actually actually be responsible for these processes .
so , when it 's really interested in a participation , how many , is so often <unk> and <unk> , we need and then we need to have new <unk> .
but not last , but i 'm also telling me all of you who are sitting here .
and that 's why i think , because i think of very important .
i think it 's important that you all go to all , and i want to encourage you with our example , to encourage you to give a chance .
and i connect them all because they 're the ones who can be in the order of a new <unk> <unk> .
so we need to look at the ability to look at the ability to look at the citizens to protect your citizens , responsibility and engagement for food and <unk> ?
first of the <unk> , for the dialogue , we 're going to go to <unk> .
in <unk> , professionals , citizens , citizens to <unk> and different interests .
what we see here is a certain kind of birth to give you a dictionary .
what we see here is some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal has to be that all of these conversations are on <unk> , so that they do n't have the <unk> interests or the <unk> capabilities , or the <unk> capabilities of the capabilities of the citizens .
the citizens in the ground are experts , they 're experts for their neighborhood they know , what you 're missing with you , which is a place in which tradition , which is missing a place .
the <unk> , especially in the city , which is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in a <unk> .
in the ignored or in a particular case , then there 's another case in a particular case , the issues that are <unk> , which is the way that is based on the project , after .
and that 's all the things that creates a <unk> , where all the information are accessible and then the place that can make place .
by the way , by the way , you can get the footprints that can provide an identification of the place .
a <unk> in <unk> means is that the wishes of the <unk> are actually <unk> .
and then , when somebody says , i want to say , `` i want to make a <unk> . ''
and of course , that can be complete <unk> , but the target needs to be <unk> in <unk> , which is the right answer , and maybe then in the <unk> , but maybe in a different place .
as i said , this must be done from the dialogue .
second point are different crochet clips .
our <unk> is colorful .
one feels very comfortable by being aware of a great group of great group and talk .
another one can write good , but then you do n't want to talk about the text .
another , maybe one of them might rather be <unk> or photographed .
or create a ideas in <unk> <unk> .
what i want to say is to say it has to be able to give it different ways to be able to get different user levels .
so we 've got to get the opportunity to come up , just check out what happens .
in the background , little exhibition .
we have the opportunity to give up <unk> .
we 've had the opportunity to paint .
we have the opportunity to write .
regardless of age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the opportunity to connect our ideas to connect ideas .
also , the way to provide outside of <unk> <unk> should be given .
for example , this can happen for a <unk> , which can happen about <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> and transparent availability of results of the results of the results of the results of the results .
we 're going to have the whole process of parallel with facebook and <unk> independent , and in the same time , news <unk> <unk> .
the third point of <unk> .
you might remember that , i 'd say that <unk> often is too late .
in my <unk> event , there was three finished <unk> .
now , <unk> is the process , but then it 's happening when he is happening in the end , and the alternative in your own self is not even able to know what 's going to happen to <unk> area .
if you get through the dialogue , and i 'm going to talk to the point of one , which is where scenarios is going to be in a area .
and by the way , by the way , also , by the way , to the <unk> itself .
and then , if not a start , if you have the <unk> , the <unk> event has so much and so looking at the experiences of the previous experience .
now , what happens is , if citizens of their city is refined and their city .
it 's already in a lot of projects .
i have an example from <unk> , which is the <unk> , probably known for many .
in new york , a project launched , there 's a <unk> .
in <unk> , there 's been <unk> dollars in six weeks to be able to be able to make the funding possible to do .
the time has been written in august , the political could not be different than to make the idea of doing it .
also , the <unk> in new york , to say , to say , i do n't have to say , because he has become one of the most important <unk> of the city or the political administration .
in the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> , stood in the <unk> .
in <unk> , we 've got back in germany , the citizens have already been <unk> plans to get it again .
the city had said , `` well , '' was n't going to be <unk> .
four weeks , the four weeks , which we have for <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> .
today 's the city of the city <unk> <unk> .
and while the side of <unk> d , it 's wonderful , and the city the <unk> , the women who started studying the initiative that has been supported and others .
in the other way , i want to paint citizens to do their own in the street .
in rotterdam , a <unk> <unk> had been <unk> .
all right , you want to say , you want to say .
and then we 're just going to do that way .
but i think it 's wrong , the city of responsibility .
why ?
one because you have a look at all of you or have a look .
and while the <unk> , it 's <unk> and companies to focus on a rule in the rule of them , the city has to be the responsibility for projects that are on the edge of the attention .
and for other , of course , as the city of the city , they 're going to go to the projects .
a <unk> initiative can only put these <unk> .
and our goal was a temporary initiative that was starting to <unk> a half of work on the results of the results , and the responsibility to come to the city .
the models of the <unk> state has bought the <unk> in january .
it 's still running more conservative .
so the problem is that we could n't have the responsibility for the moment .
but we know , now , now , if the city has been successful in the <unk> , if you 're in the negotiations that they 're going to be done , then that you 're going to be a <unk> .
but what 's happening in which form is actually open .
so to conclude , i 'm convinced that many projects , which is , because of their meaning , complexity or their cost of the city has to be developed , and they have an opportunity to create a chance of being an opportunity to create a chance to create a chance to create a chance of being an opportunity to create .
when you 're just in time and all of the citizens ,
in a city and citizens .
in a city , and all you guys are sitting here tonight .
when we do our jobs , and in the same time , the makers of the physician are not to perceive the <unk> of the citizens of citizens , but as a <unk> .
that 's it .
yesterday , the <unk> night , we were there in <unk> in the <unk> , and there 's the <unk> .
we talked about <unk> .
so this idea is , a lot of second chance to have it if it did n't work in this life , just as a second chance .
so , we found something exciting .
and we were relatively lucky that there are two things that we did n't want to experience the time .
that 's the story .
the second one was in the school , at the table , still in school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you might remember , you might remember <unk> <unk> .
i mean , it 's so , it 's now , it 's the <unk> years ago , but the words are going to go to me to <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> together , and i just want to leave back to it .
and then i do n't know how it was in my exams , and then it was the case of the <unk> <unk> , which was always sitting next to me .
no idea what 's going to be .
they 're going to understand it , so my school , my school , i was really beautiful and after i had my last <unk> of me , never quite clear , never again .
and what i 'm going to say , if i look at the year , some of the nicest days i spent there , i spent in schools .
and there 's a lot of excitement , and there 's no responsibility .
how did it be ?
how could this happen ?
and i first started that , this is something that happened to something that i could n't have to do .
i got kids .
so my wife got the kids .
and that was also clear that they had one that had to deal with this <unk> .
until one day , when she said , `` honey , it 's <unk> .
and you 're going to leave .
yes , <unk> .
and i opened the door , and then i sat in this <unk> and <unk> , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
this is what we looked at how it looked at the time .
and that 's also the <unk> , as a <unk> , and i was <unk> , and i 'm <unk> , man , you know , is really a little bit of life .
and when i 've heard the teacher , and they know , the kids do n't learn for school , but for it , i would be <unk> , i mean , `` oh , my god , '' i 've never have no <unk> .
what is what we have from school , from that school , really did n't have them done in it ?
so many of us have been able to learn the right thing .
where do you have a real job in your life , right ?
and maybe some of the world is the dominant <unk> .
now , what 's the end of the end ?
or <unk> , this ability to have a lot of time in a lot of time in a long time , only , just to <unk> it in a button , to me to be bad ?
well , i needed to have the <unk> for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what does a <unk> point of one point of one point of something that 's going to be a good doctor ?
whether the <unk> is , and whether it 's the good response of documents ?
no way .
so , no way to live for it , not for school we learn .
so when we look back so , about <unk> years , the <unk> century , there 's the <unk> .
this is the time in germany , which is actually launched in germany , and then it was a completely <unk> .
and where the school school system , how we 've got it today , the roots .
and if we imagine the time we had , in fact , the people had no access to the knowledge of the time .
and there were these four or six years they were used to go to school and have been <unk> , then the only opportunity to come to the knowledge and the facts and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information .
today , a <unk> of more information in its pocket of his pocket is than the largest library of the time .
and the middle century , that was the time of the <unk> .
so that means there 's a lot of change in the world and all of all people have needed to provide these new machines .
but in the same time , but also , people needed to wait that machines could wait and repair .
and we needed people who could build these machines , and they were doing these factories .
you might recognize it .
the <unk> school system that we have today is in germany today , has its root in this time .
and there 's probably done there .
but also , because it was really like that , which i had to learn from school for work for the work for the assembly line , which is the line of the assembly line , who was alive .
let 's look at the future .
let 's see the <unk> century , where it 's , and let 's look at the year .
the year , the year was there was the first <unk> in just <unk> .
i was done with my study , and i thought , now the point is now , you 're going to make you direct , the first company .
yes , after some of the internet , i got out of the internet , and then i <unk> , i 'm going to pass this .
and some of these companies are <unk> and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger , and some of the companies are then in the free case .
you see two times in life .
and we had 30 years , and then we had 30 employees .
so , we had a beautiful growth and we had so exciting for the <unk> professions like <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if you have a sophisticated concrete idea , what these people are doing , but when i was in school , we had no idea that it would ever been .
even when i was <unk> , i was n't talking about the internet .
and the kids that are going to send in school today , which are going to be the job in 10 , six , six or 30 years ?
the only honest answer , we have no idea .
and what do you know what facts are going to need to be successful in this future jobs ?
and when you 're honest , the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're in the future , we 're looking at the future , because the <unk> for the morning .
there 's <unk> <unk> , i read .
well , you see , you do n't know .
how do we get out , what are the school in life to learn ?
what are the things we need to make kids fit to life ?
and maybe it 's a look at what companies are looking for employees .
that 's the <unk> of school , yes ?
the alumni of schools and universities are coming into companies .
and when you look at a very serious classic <unk> , then there 's first thing , what the expertise .
and there 's what you want to do , so the reading are like that , we 're looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years , and we 're going to look at 10 years in the age .
it 's not going to be done in the future .
now , what you could afford , is the things that are always important , these are the so-called <unk> <unk> , and i think that these <unk> <unk> will be the <unk> of the future of the future .
and the principle in three groups .
this is one , companies wish to kill employees , which is flexible , so is the one .
and then almost all the companies want to think of employees with <unk> .
and then these businesses are <unk> who are <unk> .
so we 've got <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
let 's start with the flexibility .
that 's relatively fast .
if we look at how economy is working , how fast , how fast , it changes .
<unk> , all the business models are going to be <unk> from the internet .
there 's a need to provide people who can handle this change .
there 's a thousand workers who are creative .
and i have the <unk> who are <unk> .
this is quite the opposite of what the factory in the <unk> century took from the line of employees .
and the second subject is the entrepreneurial <unk> think is relatively clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's about people who are stewardship .
first of all , and her own life .
but also , the big whole .
whether it 's the company , or also , as a society , we wish people are taking responsibility for the great whole .
and the third factor , the <unk> , which is going to be nearly at the most successful .
and if we remember the football , then there was there in the internet , there was this beautiful adage .
argentina had <unk> <unk> <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't <unk> <unk> who won the <unk> .
and that could be the only thing together .
and as someone , this big innovator of our time , steve jobs , yes .
it was n't the <unk> who invented the iphone who did n't invented the <unk> , who did n't invented the itunes , which has invented nothing .
the team , had a team that has done that , because the team could make what they could have done .
so a <unk> school , which could convey these three things in the age , but that 's a lot of school in which we learn for it .
but there 's still a lot of fourth point , and that 's almost more important .
and this is learning themselves .
if the only thing we can tell you about the future with the future is that you 're not going to learn the ability to learn new and things to learn new and fun to experience that learning of the world that we 've been successful in the future life .
but this is a little bit of school , which is the idea of this stuff .
but where was i ?
i sat in this <unk> and the <unk> and the kids have , who know that it 's not a little bit of event that you have to pay for .
so this is a serious event for the motto , but there 's not not from each other .
until the point of the time , where the <unk> , all the time will be all the invisible .
i was there and what should i say , the <unk> of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest pieces of event .
less fun , it was for me as a father when the stress about <unk> and learning the entire family family .
and less fun is , when the child is sick because in school , stress <unk> .
and finally , this <unk> would end up , or was a peak of this school , too <unk> <unk> .
it was not a <unk> kid , it was like a <unk> , so on the last hour , and in fact , we were also the only parents who have been invited .
and i 'm telling you , and i 'm telling me the details of the day , which is clear , we have to have our child to be there .
but two years , but two years , where we have , there is something that does n't work .
what do we do wrong ?
and we had the question , actually , we 've broken our child ?
and are we the only ones that it is ?
now , i 've been talking about the last two years , since i 've spoken in the subject of a lot of people , and i realized , i 've learned to do it .
there 's a lot of them who are very similar , and this was two years ago , and i sat down with <unk> <unk> , a new company , the day we 've been thinking about where the journey goes , and we sat down to the bar , and we sat down to the bar , and we sat in the bar , and we sat in the bar , and we sat in the bar , and we sat in the bar , and we were
and what should i say , he 's almost the same story telling me with one of his children , he 's almost the same story , and we had the fortune that we could pull out of the school , yes ?
in berlin , there 's a lot of <unk> in different schools and we could even consider schools in the world .
but can everyone do out there ?
somehow , it was a little bit to be too little , just our children in safety , and these <unk> , there 's the way that they are .
and after all of the idea now , for school , the way we were not really changed so right , we thought we were all the first , we 've got the first thing to deal with the subject .
just , how are we going to change something like this ?
the good news is we deceived us .
we are not alone .
but we 've found relatively very quickly from a lot of great people who wanted to do , which is , which is a <unk> school , which is to provide all of us .
it 's not so much that the kids and their parents are under the suffering , which is happening out there .
when we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
when we look at a look at how the number of <unk> <unk> has changed over the last 10 years .
now can it be that all parents are doing something wrong ?
that all the kids are locked and that teachers are broken ?
or can it be that we have a school school system , which just does n't fit so much like this <unk> years , which fits too .
and we found a lot of people who were similar and we 've found people who have no kids .
and they understood that they have to take responsibility for the future that they need to take responsibility for the future , by taking responsibility for the future , and the kids now go to school in school .
and we have a lot of <unk> second , there 's a lot of great document there , and there 's been <unk> schools , there 's a great deal of teachers , and there 's almost a lot of teachers who are really dedicated and to transform something .
and there 's even a or another <unk> , which is also going to go to the first step .
and how should we help ?
we did n't have a concept that we could do with help .
but we can do one thing , we can go in these schools and we can go to these schools , and we can go to people who are school , so the parents and the students , the teachers , the teachers and students , and we can make a lot of work in two days .
so there are people who have been working together in the past , that worked at the past more so much more and learning to two days , which means to work .
and there 's a little bit of events that are very concrete challenge to solve .
and after two , so , for example , this is a new field of communication , or given the <unk> of the <unk> for a huge high school as we 're going to be a <unk> school .
or they have concrete things for <unk> problems they have in their school .
within two days , in two days , the next day , the next day , the next day can be done in the next day .
but what 's the world is what happens to these two days , and it makes it so nice to me that i 've been doing , and then i 've got to spend the schools in a high school , is that energy , which is the three things .
when the three things are in common in common , which is what <unk> <unk> .
so , like , <unk> , and if you experience a team .
then that 's a <unk> , the <unk> .
and when we started four weeks after the <unk> workshop , then we 're going to experience the school as a whole started to change that there 's a whole new culture .
and this is incredibly <unk> .
and i invite you to think about school .
i 'm going to say , `` i invite you to think about school .
and i 'm going to <unk> them , too much , about school , talking about school .
talk about what you do , but you do n't like you what you do .
you 're going to be surprised how much <unk> you get and how many people have experienced the same thing , but just not just talk about it .
let 's give us every single school in germany in the <unk> century .
let 's change the entire education system .
and let 's do this together with the people who are the school of school , the parents , the teachers and students .
because we can do this together .
thank you .
