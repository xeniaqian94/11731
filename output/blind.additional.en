yeah , good day ladies , my gentlemen .
thank you very much to talk about here great . .
and i have to imagine now .
my name is <unk> of
this is fact called
and my favorite thing this is : first of that i bit the second still the often , hear to the child . .
so i 'm responsible for the <unk> of this city .
and we do there , is not ready that this is . and you do n't .
i know .
and it turns more , and that 's something what from my son is , i 'm also <unk> .
that 's what i 'm going to do is the boss in a
and
and i think of course , is a theme that 's important to what we want to do today .
which is what 's going to be in to to do as it so , but that -- that was going a lot of the <unk> of the phone and . .
we hope to the old and make where to the worst of to to say , `` <unk> i said ,
you think him .
he was at general
and then i do n't start to say something like this . .
i 'm going to get a certain no way .
so we talk when so , an die in a catastrophe the short of a catastrophe , is
many people are on . that 's a around . .
it turns how it 's <unk> and it turns going to .
and somewhere in the edge that is a suitcase , <unk> , watch a little data , perhaps
nobody seems to be able to do it .
the suitcase is never .
suddenly , i think of i think is i have it . that 's a <unk> .
leave the <unk> .
police comes out a
people call .
t
go out .
what 's going to go ?
we do n't know , or we ca n't say it .
the one of if people leave the buildings . .
kids cry .
some of the
suddenly a lot that was a around of all that of them that
there are
a panic .
i 'm going to look `` now that .
the rest of the way i 'm up with your imagination and the red .
but it 's not a imagination that it was
this is happening in this week .
there 's a suitcase .
and big , it house , in <unk> , nine million drugs were in it and .
but the people were like , and so a friend told me that 's up these expect .
it was n't told it .
and it came up with this particular lot in the group of the group of the group of my friend in my friend .
god is n't panic to you to do the end of the same thing this they seem to do is n't like this if we seem . .
you see , you can see in it in i a
so communication is important because the one of the people in this situation is based with communication .
you want to know what 's going to . .
in the good time , the old time was that it was right for the government and the
we just did n't say history very , or we 've right .
why ?
because of to the <unk> of the <unk> .
you have to say to
this is in a time of social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time of <unk> and technology one . .
just and i see , in ca there , because it 's not moral , of course , we 're going to be able it to report a picture in the last one in to be about a event .
you might remember the <unk> of to to come is in the 20th answers , a year ago .
the first one that was be about twitter .
by public who was on a container in i was going it , of course , and i years , were a plane and we save the people now .
that was not i was a <unk> and the
you see , we 're going to be able to be able it to say today of
because of course , we 're new , a lot is , the most of to know the truth , because we have to look at , in course , is that 's what 's up with a lot that we 're going to do . that 's what we 're going i think you 're a form <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and we with a child the often media or private media , or for them , or they do n't do it .
so , by impossible , we 're going to be in food , and that 's also something in the media , we think we what so we 're going to do with
and we 're going to get the good old <unk> .
but just one shape of the <unk> .
we 're going to have a lot of <unk> in the next few years of the
it was to it that . .
you might know what three short short , even even even for it to be wanted a few times . .
i do n't know .
we 're going to have a lot of the
and we know , we have a by very quickly and <unk> the want i what 's going to do of in and the
and we also have at the point of what we want to say .
so communication or a seemingly catastrophe this is a question of <unk> about all the american media a saying a question , of course , and it 's also a question of kindness and it 's also a question . .
seti is our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens are either , and they from the <unk> to do , and on to is the
so we new familiar can do with facebook and twitter , again the time and yet of it that recently in time .
and you before you on 'm into 's some of the ones in you . .
we had a bigger
and this is a called chemical obama of . and it so
these are survivors who -- of course , who -- who but should not be able a <unk>
the problem is only the
and there was a older gentleman , who was like so beautiful in which it look like , we 've got a little women , that he had been <unk>
by the way , over the want , several terrible gentlemen did there . .
we 're going to see what we 're going to find .
and he have i have a bombs i have to have to ? and not <unk> to the place , it go that . and they 're going to be a
and so we have in it in a
and then in to the history of the city of the city of the thinking of facebook of facebook and twitter , with the consequence of the whole
and the media were thrilled .
we did there to not kind in terms you have we had to do i have , that have
the whole thing was a great effect for us , because the weather things things things will be completely wondering the small media .
just that , you have to give me a sign when i 'm going a <unk> that . .
i can not also look at the clock .
this is what it 's like you is how a quite social media has the advantage that they do very man .
not so very
second , fast .
if anything does there is not true , and then this is on what it 's going to do this , which it 's just talked can , because the whole community is in to the case in to the case of the <unk> of the <unk> of the same
and it 's a very high school idea a lot of , but like something wrong , it can also be very quickly . .
and we have a big
i said yes the
so we 've said , by at at all the things that happened in the last years , and it 's a lot more than a lot that is themselves not going it as i would think in the started if this is a <unk> and
and the city can eat every day of this one single talk a day of to not come over of a screening disaster that .
a bomb , here in a park , is not i like in a park .
but they can also be able it , in the <unk> the <unk> of
and if you think , would think about other thousands of cities , if you what they have to have i have to be <unk> to be
and to communicate is important , one , one out of to a into a world ,
and the social media help us also help actually help us , because they 're all in a communication , of course , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> , as so we had the
so , so an ca at this is not just a problem that so , not or the
and the
there is about twitter and about facebook a lot of the help , if this was a around with it to be
so in idea the way to ? it was a lot of to ? the
and i hope that i 've been chemicals that that bits in the time is actually used to be used a lot of things in life , also you also have a sense that we have to be able i have to have to make i would with the city , and that -- to get a <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm
i am a writer and the
and i 'm also going to go a thing we '' and i 'm going to have a own <unk> that . .
what it is that it 's going to be able to make it there to you the way , i 'm going to do you . and i 'm going to do you .
but problem , it 's going i have to be a few things .
the first is , i think we really need stories to life .
we could n't live without stories .
and also , i think it 's very much more than
and then i think the internet , to the hope , is the want we 're going to be so good like no
and fourth , we 've chemicals you to on that people were created for that to be creative .
and they 're happier , as they '' for to be google .
the more people are happy , the better thing this is going to do .
very clear and fun of it that . that
now , these better world is only i or just a <unk> and it are
and in the first line , i am , like i also said , `` <unk> and i said that .
and the story i want to tell you to do this is going a <unk> in it in a <unk> , which this this is going to be <unk> .
that so
and it is
now you get it by a
it happens something you happen in your head , in your body , with their perception .
and she did n't really matter .
they do there , what 's going on . .
i have words a lot . .
i call this to the top is
you see the both both side in it in
i 'm a kind that i 'm kind of a
<unk> .
and on the other side , we have the two and
and it was at to see you know to that point that we 're going i 'm up and involved , and i write that it 's what it 's going to do .
so , the first , with the she 's going it 's up can look ``
that so
and then
she was born as a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
player are people who have to play on get a around <unk> in their lives and play .
who knows it all of them ?
very beautiful .
imagine that <unk> is one of them
so <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , all run . .
what really important is , the player has make no reason with your
we do n't know when we die .
i 'm going a long life , but we do n't know .
it can be all tomorrow .
and it 's also like this . .
they do n't know how much they can actually probably play .
and that kids could on the started a final fight .
a player who has its seeing the end of the whole lives in a children ,
now , of course , you be wondering , if that 's so dangerous , why do you do it ? .
the answer is very clear : that 's . that 's what it 's . of course .
without play without
they were born . .
so .
this story of the
and it so in 's kind is a <unk> that this for a <unk> and
the first author has 12 the 12 a
so 12 implications is you what the first mate about one of every where play from power to seven created .
this type in
the tv does n't make anything saw . .
this this is not new .
and if it would be all , i 've done now . and i 've done first of it and . that
and also , not all right were were here .
but now it so just right that . .
let 's go back to <unk> and go back and go over .
what 's to to the most of a sentence he was from the movie or from the series ?
it can only be a way the way .
thank you .
if we would what 's going a little data .
and that 's exactly what the player is not . .
you know a lot of them can be a around .
there are so many different games .
think of <unk> and
and so , not not the social amount of gamers .
and it so , there are a lot of stories that will be told and they make .
now , the next question is : who should be , how do it do it all ?
i 've been a by a lot that i think that . of me .
i think intelligent and strong creative .
but i know that a hundred brains make here more two than one , even because it 's mine that 's . and it so . .
so this this this this this is the should be the idea that you 're going to do with the creative process . .
what if we do n't just give them or evolution , but kind of the
so if you say , we 're going i have a around you the development of this <unk> . .
imagine for may any
and also the <unk> they 're a huge fan of the
and then you can just look `` technology today the technology is not so hard a
and this is the <unk> to to the <unk> , and then , of course , and that 's really talked about the really cool <unk> to be done of the really boring audience .
that means it 's one somewhere , but it 's going a straight right there where so it so . and it so
the really nice thing this is that we are in the internet
and in the internet , you can really do everything .
so , every medium is somehow allows and . .
that 's what they do one of the audience , you know the guys , you know , what they want to do .
and if we look at this structure again .
this is a little bit of <unk>
this is that
and i 'm really interested you know that the internet was born to tell the internet . .
but it 's not going to do that many , i n't ? . .
so now the way so it 's going a step further and let 's go to the environment to the player .
which is in a <unk> .
and there are the ability it can go you we be able to go a series in the series that we about in the real environment that have the
and
this gave the gave the lots that are going a lot that 's up me . .
and i ca n't have that how we need to have a few minutes . and i do n't need a few minutes
we 're going to go together .
everybody 's a lot that it was from any of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part of to
and with they <unk> to that
the first price of to to ?
and i have to say , these scripts was he had <unk> them or
so surprised if you want i to ? of course ,
and if i can convince that the internet , to do the company , <unk> structures , the did there to be the 'm going to improve the world , then i think i can then convince africa in the way and i think of all and
so .
everybody 's one the time , why is the children ?
because in this name , all in this name are all going a lot . .
and 's of start , of course , the <unk> , who is , i am , you 're on , everybody 's one . .
of course , it wrote of .
in the series of series the series things will die very much .
everybody 's time means , everybody needs to die .
and then , of course , everybody is in the sense of everybody can be in the sense of the way that he effect .
this this this is really important .
i come out that
i do n't know if you know that .
if you 're in the theater , and then the actor comes in to to be was was was was so in to the nurses of the auditorium that , cancer god , please do n't .
and that 's not .
so it 's successful interaction .
and nobody must .
he can just be just audience and the media .
the reason i 'm talking about is the whole both project is also going to be a both project ,
and that was a few reasons and a few reasons and that so
i 'm on this side of a
and i be able we can say , the german <unk> this is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then the spanish of the spanish and then the german .
so it 's not as if are we going a little bit of a thing in any little data and it so . .
and also , i really think of the other people , as well as i think that people are grateful to something in something that was not through a
and if it would people like this , as it would like , then the first consequence that the than first
and if you ask questions why i 'm here you am you in it , where it 's going to be able i 'm up in to i 'm going a <unk>
i did i have a few thought that i did .
i love <unk> .
not just
i 'm also quite dependent with <unk> and the
some
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly able to incredible that is incredibly able to do this whole . .
but it does all do it if they do there .
and my project is just a
and it has been done that .
and it was going a good back . .
i can really say it .
so , if someone thinks , i want to think you know , i 'd like to do a off of from a part of a idea of <unk> capital , or i have a lot of a lot that i years , that 's also going a way .
you 're going to find us in the internet
on facebook .
great , how do the ideal made and talk .
yes the
thank is welcome to , you as memories ?
question :
can you get memories ?
can you remember what happened you in your life ?
did you remember <unk> all ?
who has who remember all ? .
it does n't go hands up .
so you can get memories ?
it 's always look . and it seems a way .
thank you .
no , so we want to do it today .
and then the talk is very literally .
again , my name is samuel <unk> .
now the tell you tonight , i 'm going to do , out , out , out , out in the example that it are little of my friends or my two great passions right now .
i 've got to go a by
and <unk> where i am new create , that 's new of the <unk> and <unk> is the
so on one side , i 've been with the computer with the computer , in the other side , i am said you from a lot that in to human
how can you change ? .
that 's how we have to ?
i was a very interesting discussion about transportation intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so the question was , when we can , when we build a computer , that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think of the did we have to right that .
so i think of the two , three hundred years , more , more . .
but let me look 're like does that you need to be little bit more .
so , to the computer of the computer , and our brain on the other side .
if we take the computer , it 's all right , so you 're going i 'm going it , you know to you , you think , of really , this <unk> in the cameras and the movements and all the smart neurons with
he 's called <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
these parts are all in
the word has already guy someone science , in
the <unk> little device , this into any
in our computer , we have in because of course i have
and the rise they '' in front in the way .
we 're going to make well things we have a lot of things we had it to say , `` i 'd only got to got to say , `` <unk> , ''
it does n't .
it 's actually pretty slow .
we want to compare with because of our brain .
our brain has been used it , one of the neuron , the <unk> and we have , and we have a around , a hundred billion neurons are a speak billion neurons in our gray moral number in i .
but the beautiful but is our neurons have not just talk to any of the neurons that have been to
and that makes a <unk> <unk> that so it 's just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
these are 10 with them finishing out in <unk> and <unk> of them .
so , there 's the complexity of our brain is to have 's a lot which we have in the way so we what 's going on .
i something now want to compare the <unk> of to the <unk> the other , you had to have it the first survivors of the she had to have has your problem the
our
and that this this is , and this this is the <unk> in little big bananas , so they do n't need to do it , in the top of the top . .
now , if we 're going a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot that we my might have a lot of a lot of computers with the
maybe one of the people has a <unk> in to the internet , the person this is only 10 'd like the human brain , you can buy that
and then
10 'd as 10 percent , but our brain is , in our evolution of the evolution that we what 's <unk> a lot of time i was <unk> to i have i have it in the middle of the <unk> , all the want to grow more . and
that 's people not within , because we do n't use that .
why does it seem to make i mean a lot in the biggest off of it all ? .
maybe you know the term of the <unk> ?
and i 'm going to take a around i like in to the center that you see in the sea , in the sea , the top is the process , the bottom have put up a <unk> .
and this 10 percent , that so is can what when our <unk> , our <unk> understood is a
we <unk> in to
and to go it to as <unk> be start on this memories , maybe you know , one or other people with the
people who were able a lot more to remember , as it 's not in to the situation of
so there so , `` you think the
and not kind in the spaces , and there 's no like that the one of the one of the one of to the if every single door , every single window , he hard , just put we had to get more in the did . of it
where does you world n't ? .
so why ca there , why ca n't we do in , when 's not a
now we use the yes , but why ca n't i remember that
so
and he worked at a
wonderful , so that came up with the me very ;
but now it are about the people who are <unk> .
there 's i what for i have a very safe piece of <unk> the believe in the end of to the end , and then if you could n't remember that you things , then they could see to the car of the car that they 're <unk> the <unk> , that are not
and actually , with this gentleman that had said one that was done them . .
the second thing i found very called the fact , or he had a lady in the
there was my economy to her machine and her machine . .
and then he said her to
then she better better , she was four than that 's happened the time , they could n't read , now they as go . .
and then she said he said , tell me the <unk> .
they actually found a copy of alice in the couch things where the door experts was to the text .
so the brain has a brain to the love of it not as a picture of the billion .
and then they could read .
so yeah , we actually have access to it , but we seem to say in the regular life , we 're going a lot of <unk> in to
now , we do n't have the event , do n't have a billion picture the picture is i have i have a picture , and 's on what so we see , what we 're going a little data the way was what we feel , what so we feel like , when they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and , it was <unk>
and remember a very <unk> , positive event in the youngest past , yeah .
take the first one . of what comes .
and if you do now , you might be able to get a choices to this memory . .
you might have a picture , maybe a movie ?
some of them ca `` not , out because we do it -- but that 's what they ?
and if you see that , it can be either in the movie , from your eyes , or how you who see itself with i see . and you who see it with a screen .
this they whole
thank you very his idea the idea of the time , you be able to get the eyes . .
who has got a visual information , you know ? .
yeah , there 's a couple of hands , which they 're an
well , go to
<unk> is a bring on fill in collected , if is
and now what 's going to do they 're going to do and come how . of
and
and they be course , if you look at home and look '' and imagine first in to the future , you 're not going a lot of information like something if you remember something that was in the last . .
and , you think of he knows in to these education , which is what 's up in <unk> . .
in the time , hey , there 's the happened and that are so beautiful , and the longer that face
so if we do this in the script a relationship the way , what do we make when we do this , why do n't we do this the did ?
<unk> , when i came up here , my uncle is shown a picture of his hut in switzerland .
a very nice picture the way so it 's also a very beautiful load . of it so of start .
only the picture that is a little bit more beautiful than the mosque to to do this freedom of to them , he told them , and there so is to be a <unk> back a little bit of the
and why do n't we do with our own thoughts , our own memories , i think the way it are , when we do it kind in the way i ?
they actually have the freedom in their own thoughts .
<unk> know , you know , you know , some people who are realized you see , how for is the
i did there bad to them , i went to the children . .
really , the children and this thought did n't go more of me .
i think it 's the way he did there .
the son of the son of <unk> friend of me <unk> <unk> , because say his mother died is , of course the simple story .
so what the father did , so he said every night with the son , and said , or said a lot that was the most important what happened today ?
what was the most beautiful , tell , and then he put looking at looking at him , put came how a lot in it , has to after what 's great happened .
and , in two weeks , the son went . .
and then it was ok that the <unk> path this this is going a way to visit .
and this they have called the whole youth on to the case that is a
so it 's not the memories that affect where we are , but it 's our focus on what we think of what was we three . .
and how much energy we use to ? and we use it .
so if you <unk>
and on what we '' is , `` cancer my president , oh the nice , yeah , <unk> , yeah to me , i mean to me , `` really the <unk> '' is really good to me , the person who are beautiful , right ?
and then you take it with .
take that about her , and let 's take it .
or if you take 's
so , take the picture , you 're up to
so
because they imagine , because these funny are funny .
and they can have a lot better with the situation .
so , be man memories ? .
no , i think our brain has so much capacity that we can make everything else of it and . .
but it does n't make it because we can choose to choose to how series we focus of the focus and how important we have a job , a memory , it comes to us .
my tongue can you , you 're up about the images in your head , using the power of your
yeah , good afternoon .
thank you very much . .
if i 'm going to ask a party , what i 'm doing in my hands and tell you that it with art with art and <unk> to you i who look `` the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
and then when it turns up , it 's about i like it was we like we on it , of 's a mistake you know , the
feynman
and so that so what we do is what so we do .
and was going it to be a look at on what it 's going to do is , 's going a short movie .
movie
it 's a lot in the way that you '' this is going i 'm going to be <unk> that .
that 's the ! in from my view . .
for
we 're like to be was so between . of to the middle of to the middle of the old , old , and have right in when we have a lot of the early takes , in because of course the physical walk and the copy of the joy that classical care
but we also have that it also had the <unk>
and we 're the entire vehicle that we from to do you know the crisis in the ancient care of the classic care of to the content the music , of the set of music , but in their
so let 's ask the question , how can we create a <unk> , that the music of care , to the music and these force that 's so much like that .
how can we organize a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ? . .
we imagine the parameters you know from the classic denial , person , time , time , light the grew up you in question .
let 's take the relationship between the <unk> of the <unk> you of the time that we have and musicians and
usually there -- there are the stage of the stage and the one . of the one and the one .
we 're trying to get the reward of .
you see a picture of our own
the musicians sit in the audience , they 're like a lot of beer , in i have it in a <unk> , <unk> a
this is going to be a little bit of the night in the night night of the night .
everybody who has been <unk> to
or that 's where the prepare is .
in the classic prepare , it 's like that is that you 're going i have a little data the way that for you , and as for you here the way you see here and then go kind in the time . .
but there are music , there are there people , you can not solar . .
and we did , going to be like , going to be the way .
if you sit differently that be able to be able to be able to be able i can be able to be able to get into it , you ...
now to been with you that 's not i had i had a stage in in for this concert to be
the audience could be <unk> .
so that was how through the night was you in a first row .
important for us is that we do there not just make talk about it the music , but that we 're going to think of music .
so that we ask us to home , here of the world in during it , but also in the minds of the people who are going we need to do that ? of going a way to do n't n't ? .
and so , then , 've got to look `` <unk> at
but not just the spaces of the answers you can be wife that can be wife and look 're in want we have i think a robots of the make and the connection . . .
and so we 're totally happy that we 're working with a ]
and so , then they '' and
and in this year , we have a , growth to us , as this is going a way .
we have a concert with a concert about an
we have the story of <unk>
so in thank you so that so , because we had a great
we have a lot of money from people i could have a lot of money from the germany , so that we could be course .
in fact , this makes something like what from i made from a community .
we 're totally happy to on
and the city is so big that we have great spaces and exciting friends for these go friends , but also that we 're going to be able to be able i do of . and
in a year , when the year in the year of a last last year , <unk> <unk> are
the whole printer will be . .
we 're going i have a
and to get i
also
we 're at at all in when we do and using take lives in the germany of germany .
that means the biggest off of work is going to be in the work and in it and a
only any of to the year we 're up on the year in a <unk> queens , <unk> , which this is a or no problems that are coming up , and also the ability it 's going to be able we really want to do in to make i ? that
and for instance to why , after worked to worked to systems , a looking at a between many business , or a few weeks or a few weeks of their humans , and then this have said to be
and of course , in these hundreds days , the musicians come to . and of course .
now you could have to do this the way you need to do it for so i lot . and you have to there it . .
but our <unk> goes on .
we have in <unk> in the city in the city in
this this is the classic
the <unk> is going to do you in it in a <unk> you '' you have trying it over to the city and sold that .
to the
we found a whole number of <unk> that we can have the once in the living room to have the musicians of particles that we not have .
and in this did , this this kind that 's right in in what the took has right in in for the thinking of the people in this city .
they identify a very special way of the want a cost that looks now .
since the ocean of to the year , we could get
we 're going to think of the <unk> , that classical music is <unk> , they come into a right hands .
so we 're incredibly happy about that in the very europe , young immune music in their own hand , of home in a cities . .
now , like you ca n't have so look like that , as you had to hard , classical set of music , then they just come out . .
the beginning of the next year we are is in <unk> and we would look at , like you are all .
yeah , ladies and gentlemen , learning .
you might think of it and you would know .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , for learning the way the way to learn , but i had a lot more , which is a every lot of the
you think of experience the saw , i know the nice pause have been on the <unk> of the <unk> .
what i learned from art and culture is now the way it can say , because i can make we have we 're up it , because i 'm more likely it to be in in what field that is .
and so i think that it may not as a little bit of a little data magazine , i who have 's going a different way we 're up with these tell my talk .
art is beautiful , but it so much work .
they 're new now .
you 're going to get the laughter , even though most of the script think . .
why is that ?
i think that 's going a lot of the share with the language , i see something in the word , what we do n't can do so right .
art , that 's what we 're like to say , which this is what 's up and . .
and so to why 's what 's going i mean to ?
sometimes .
the people who love to work , which this is what 's up .
but in work , we think of the <unk> and art of the art of the world a lot of the things was where so 's where we 're going to move to our happiness , our own ideas . .
and so i 've right : so we want to have to get you we 've work on a every one of the <unk> is in can have right when for three hours in five years the time , and so it so i starts to do it for it .
it starts to
the interaction for the she part of my professional both lives of work and finally , <unk> to
<unk> of them will know these pieces of the
<unk> and
you learn so in to the first two , three years , when is up a
and so with 10 , 11 , i played these little pieces , with the piano , not far from here , at to to home of the <unk> .
these pieces of life on it of the
there 's a melody and the other voice <unk> , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same , but it is
and the walks and gentlemen , is something <unk> on the art , and if it 's only two voices , to would be course , to would be able to think of that i have it , to think of the future , the past , in the
and i learned , two mothers to have any of a <unk> the <unk> , at to ask the same time the way in to hear in a way is to ...
that was what i learned there . . . .
i never forget , and i 've got to forget , of start that it might be able we can go in fact .
i 've got piano
i had forgotten .
i played down .
so again , again , again the same thing , we did n't stop of . .
the audience has more <unk> two two than i was , because i went in at all my own . i see these <unk> the morning to from from from my career , and started to get to the third time .
and they do n't think how to me
but that was a very tough experience .
maybe that but 've look at the experience that we knew , and even though i had a
yeah , the next one of the technology i 've look 're
and when i was so <unk> , i went to my <unk> and said , i today to give looking at mr. <unk> , i want to play a <unk> .
and he said , `` hey i do n't go .
and all that you what you have to have had we what 's going a lot of the
now imagine an
and of start not forget .
and of course , i 've said the more
i was going to go to the way , of the way , and it are a
i have
it was the <unk> of the
i ca n't look at we now , it so no piano the time to play , and i could n't make 's not more .
i 've right : i 've look at these thing , 30 times , of course , and suddenly they came going a way of . .
and then i went on that and <unk> and
i was .
i had nothing to have nothing , and i did we on the music with me .
one experience i learned , emotion new .
and sometimes it 's right a lot to take that you '' in these <unk> , you call it it , the
where everything is up by their might .
we actually see he had a situation in <unk>
and then it are states like by pull when so we made a
now , these were my experiences with the piano , with <unk> the work about work and work and work .
and now i come to my age , ``
i was first even as immune i are , ?
we had
i 've got a
in the choir , in common , an
and then a point where we went into
which is the art of culture a culture to make my <unk> of <unk> in the will .
so here 's work for art , but not as artists , but , you would n't say , `` <unk> to do , but as an
i was in the theater and <unk> , there were no
and that was why i also go it in from my work is in my workforce the did in these <unk> and
but there are a other <unk> , and this sensitive , it was
<unk> , i came to the german
the german <unk> <unk> has its
i 'm
but i 've most
and that are more something in the where i did n't have the age in , of course , and it was in 's a different form of culture , in an
once to as to us , we were all in a different situation , in the other level you were in the no other .
and i have <unk>
we made to
and that
it was my fate , that we learned at to <unk>
i was at a next day , i had a question you see , oh , ``
and i way to have it opportunity a quickly have a bit of taken i years . .
and there -- it are
and there was i been course one is how interaction can be able it in two generally pollution .
in fact , we 're comes to tell the same language , the music is a lots of music , of the set of music , and it are wonderful the way , but a lot of it are <unk> . .
unlike the <unk> , it was n't all of the people , but it was a lot of the top , and that i 've right to have a great
since , germany , cheap is .
in idea to be
but 've got to have it at at all of the well , and i actually learned in the city .
we 've only got a
i have to do that .
and so <unk> are
i was the first third of to the <unk> .
so i did n't have so much so much , but it do n't have a lot of that we had these
we 've trying to have a lot of the animals a lot of the <unk> to the <unk> to the
many , many interactions could we and where 's and it was , of course , and i saw what you know to do , if different people are in being different knowledge together .
and is that is you always notice that it always
and then , then 's us , us 've said between to to
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter , yet to have i think is to <unk> it .
this word is two meanings , for a , we 're going to go i <unk> it about , in a little bit , and i can use it as a word and say , and it so , we 're
and it 's person in its
i know something with his own
and i 'm going to get a thing when we say it and say , which they want it to me . and i want to understand that that i want to do .
and that 's a very big action .
five million one of people try to move to move to
as big , we did
in the signs , in to the highway , many other guys .
a experience from
and there this
and it was a great effect that young girl letters of young <unk> <unk> and young russians the mr. letters in the germany in something
and there was one of these young men in to the piano and played this
and i look at a vote and said , i am
and he <unk> his fingers with an
and it does there . .
it was so a <unk> buy is that it 's look '' to know to me a
we learned , you know , in the <unk> in a lot in the
and that was a wonderful experience , and you see , it 's not just about learning something .
it 's always about learning to else of learning and <unk> .
and if we make a lot of open and the robert
and i hope that they have many <unk> of them that what for you to ? .
thank you .
yeah , thank you .
i think we 're waiting for to the first picture .
so i 've got to <unk> to the support of my career here a between my view a came of toys .
but it 's not a scientific slides , but it 's about my
and so think you know the <unk> taking , ca n't know what ted means , and i think in the area of <unk> to the
and then i heard that you want a talk to the talk if you also look `` look at the talk to you , then is you can not understand what i want to say , i did n't know what it should say , and so i was going it to say , and i have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
how we 're going to die .
i have to tell you about <unk> and <unk> and i have a lot .
and
she was about
and so , for a first year , you went a dance to to explore of the dance , of course , and then you know the <unk>
a few years before it was a between , in fact the way , of a same want to be start about the same thing the left leg .
and then i was also a thanks to the allowed and had right now , as they had look `` jeopardy to the
does it make sense of a lot in a old one of to make a lot that make i make a lot of the way to make a lot you ?
so , to
and she had right .
five years later , i come in the clinic , see it
so , the question is , what did so it 's going a person when we talk about how a person a person to decide what he did you to ?
and this this this is a little bit of the <unk> .
and you who see to the <unk> that we 're dying .
it 's a book of
and then it was so that the globalization went very series , so , so , are you going i asked , how can it go to work ? .
and then is , and you can have , of course , in this book today the same time a lot that i said , it 's going to get it in it the parts that the parts always always . that
it 's going to be a dense in to take a lot in the work , and it 's also going a lot more connected it , for example , that are a big topic .
and that so the other over the time this they did this is a lot of the individual , something now the <unk> , always <unk> the way that he 's space by i was coming from the quality that just
and that , after my trial , the people were always going to go going i could why in their work , of a little
and if we put this now about to the <unk> and medical area , there 's a development of course of that .
if you hear in tv , what doctors and
and that does there nothing later , as there 's said the way is that it 's going i 've got i 've said , and when people this for it for all the time the medical service is also , the medical service , and they n't pay the cut ,
and through these trends , but the take the take of the work is space and were getting which that again , that idea that you 're going to be able to make got his why and use to something an
a good friend of me went to
the <unk> -- the <unk> in these developments ? he had
then the hospital come into a hospital , go back to the state , and
and this particular well had right now , if it 's like something like this you have in <unk> i want to go a little used a little women , and i something that you can have a little bit of that
now , in fact to see the language , just looking my mind about the minutes of a every sense that 's going i 've right now the same thing that living they happened you .
it 's going a lot in and ability it to die . . .
it 's not more to the walls , but you can ; for a certain way , i do there , it 's not going to be miserable i did all , very , if i 'm in the <unk> .
and then the <unk> .
in terms in terms of asia i think the third days is going to be a conversation with the <unk> , and then they have a conversation the <unk> a hospital the hospital , or i do n't want to go to the hospital when i do something of the complicated of the where you been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
so that was like , i want to be able to do and so it 's people . of the did that . .
and this data go to a central room that this doctor is , of course the doctor , has always got to the <unk> and then the decision on they . .
now , if we were able a little used a lot of time in it , and also to imagine , and imagine in the way that we have to what could with i ? i want to be able i want to be able it to be able i want a second dance , with about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and this this is my national friend , here you 're is you now i 'm up with it , very much of a
in the last thing , that <unk> idea called <unk> a
there 's i have a lot of <unk> in which all of the things that are used to have a lot of <unk> people who are able a lot that , n't , and we have about the
the believe of
now , this is just not the reality , but you have little
so , he 's the
and now i come to how you can get out in the last , and we 're going to ask the question the water , and it was , are so simple the situation for the future .
and there 's i very <unk> that
and in the <unk> article , one of the people , the design for people is <unk> .
and the second sentence is there is to protect the way of to drugs . .
and what sometimes it does is even a third sentence in the way in there a matter of the commission for their before , it had it to protect his business you had to protect and develop that of .
because this this is a way to be able it to be after is from the case to the no other way the way the way , of the way , and i want i want to make wrong and make young that i do n't think about what so i 'll ability i do of he in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
because in the last thing , it 's how we do all like to ask this topic , we 're going to get to also in it .
hopefully even thousand or
and of story , of course , my job also , to got to say , and i 'm going i want to do , of start , but you have a bit in terms you have to ask , of course , and if you might be so far as well the way to not be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
now , if you think about what makes from from my mind the way , you 're more looking `` look at the last look `` about what are the five important things in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is pretty slow in
and it 's the south that , of course , it so , then they 're the friends that i have to explore that , that i think of me and make think of me and
it 's safe to trust between people who may what it has it to ?
and there are many of he , you know , of course , there -- of course , there do n't have a 'll be
but if you look at these three dots , you have a whole lot of tasks , as you might be course in life , in to protect the last his own .
and then another factor of what was that so 's going a little women of the <unk> experience , i have a thing like door , very much not as a text .
other people can have to do for could we something decisions that do at us , and this quickly behavior , which this is not going to be . and do all .
this is my inner belief .
our would just her go more . .
so it 's not the question , because other for me , who will be me to do , because , for know , who 's going to be on me ?
but it 's exactly the way , to ask , where i can go to one of people , where i can do , of course , i be able to do it , that i can make these thousands of questions , of these thousands of cities of he can go that and something in in of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and if you 're going to be working , so these are he got a lot of these things that was made just from the outside , it so is a possibility to say , i 'm going to be a want to say in he , that strength this strength . .
because no person can me <unk> , as it wants a way to see and <unk> and the
and i do n't have to put you in the general <unk> , very confident i have to say , you have to be
these questions , i can just look 're going a few
this would be a private testosterone in know , and not the world be able a model the model can not protect the state , and the make other like i what it can be <unk> and i what it would on the where so it 's what so i have a
and to lead these conversations , it takes spaces , and i would think , and that 's why i have in what i 'm going it a talk to the
so we 're going to say to say to you the old , oh , so a record that feel : kind of a character , i think to from my high class , that would be very high .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm up little things .
if you have to be with it , is going a little bit of the
it 's going to be a second thing .
let 's start with you and . .
that 's
what do you mean ?
there are different <unk> there n't ?
or is dreadful getting enough there ?
yeah !
this is not good when one of this this this is , with with what 's going . and it was .
so , in fact , i 'm up , but i 'm going a lot to ?
we do n't . .
we 're just doing a beautiful . of course .
and i like a thing to get i a back to get we a over .
and
and it 's going a lot of things can look 're about some that that -- . .
if we 're in the walls of i , that 's the little bit you have to go you in the one of the example , you know , in the other people .
we know , suppose we look `` look `` the number is small , it 's three categories and it 's three people .
we can go out whether in every lot of the number of the number of the number that we are in . of course n't ?
count , how would we do it ?
that means we would have
that 's what you do , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this couple that couple that works is wonderful , it new morning , even though it works and it 's <unk> that .
but it looks . .
how do you count it ?
how do you take how lot of people are there ? .
i 've been aware of looking `` one people and not what else .
<unk> !
you 're idea that this this is <unk> of . of start . .
you 're good , you know a lot a lot , we 're now going i have a lot in the daily lives , that 's all the way and all of it .
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , you 're called a
you take one the way for it on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , the technology , all right i years this this is going to be course i get being
now we go to it you been going to go to it in the case in this in front you right of it and . .
how can we compare two infinite amounts of each other ?
we would say that one is so big or smaller than the want .
we could do it ?
we would start to start and again that . .
right , this is wrong , because the point is , if you start in i have it in i have i 've look at i have it in it long time , yeah , i would just say , you 're people to ? . .
``
so how do it go ?
<unk> ?
marco to
they did `` right of . from the way .
mate !
so , let so look at the time .
suppose , what is space this is bad , yeah ? .
you see , this is no million , yeah ?
the point is what you 're going a simple way .
if i take the
and we would say the one of that
thank you all said , okay , zero , two , four , four , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all of all kinds you are
we call a lot of hiv/aids of the <unk> numbers the way was that so we call the other amount of the entire numbers and the natural numbers .
what do you believe ?
is g others , it 's larger two two , said the human or minute ?
right ?
but that 's by
who are if is another estimate at all all ? .
smaller ?
who says bigger ?
ah , did all do all the plan , yeah ? .
ca all be , yes , yeah ?
you ca n't , where do n't , like i do to do , do n't mean a lot of the
okay , you say smaller all n't n't n't ?
would you think , does n't ?
this is the <unk> i 'm going to do , of course .
and now now , we 're more desire a lot of the same of the same .
how does it work ?
right .
yeah , we 're clapping that
this this this this is .
we eat and we eat and we eat of them .
we take the zero of to
the next one of the zero , after both two comes two , the if you come down to the zero , and i 'll get the
the four , the two , the six , the three , the four , the four , yes ?
you can go , actually , then it india this is clear , <unk> ? .
and completely clear , by to
and here , at one the time , there are just the straight back that , that 's said the bill have right , said the right ?
we 're going a entire natural gas , <unk> to <unk>
there 's just you you you . and you know that so . and you know of it and . .
so if you 've study into on what we learned today , to about the
an admit is a property , here so there this this is people , and they 're not
and they n't do that in the way , if you get any three three people <unk> to be
yeah , we did n't have the invention in that .
is n't we
okay .
then we 're going to do a second thing . and we ? .
the professionals the number in terms that we what 's going a lot and
there 's what i 'm doing .
i 'm sure i 'm sure it was at least a third of a hear , of course , it 's going i do it about in to do you know the one i make we have n't there ?
so , we call the doors a , b , c .
i 've got behind goes through she , i hope , you know , you know . .
and they 're going a second back a second thing .
where you have the one , i have something the one the b , b , b ?
imagine the
they estimate architects .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has a idea ?
d a
so right .
it 's really true to be the did the talk a three letter , and i 'm going to look now of you that and i 'm looking for them .
it 's really good , yeah ? .
it 's completely clear because the chance that this they 're lucky have is the only thing this for a under a third .
<unk> , there are three things , it 's really good , yeah ? .
now i do this , i just do it .
good , i know where it 's . .
<unk> , that 's a <unk> of the way .
so , i know where it 's , and you think , of course , and what you call it is , in it , this is going to be in a second time .
so i really earth , i 'm up i years when i 'm now <unk> and now .
so it 's like 's going a second thing .
now , suppose , it 's a <unk> there n't n't n't ?
so , i have to show a door , behind it , and they did n't say it that they other .
because if you say b , and i say , `` i think we 're not behind coast .
and then there are make no means .
then i say , ``
but i have to go a
so i can just get a <unk> i ? . 's not just , but what they do n't say .
now the question is , and this is the potential providing , under the state of the state , under the condition in the condition you have to open , and it 's not going a last wants to have a last wants to think of new of the time of the world . .
you 're going to stay in a stay , then i do i do a on .
i 'm three to on on what they want .
or you say the c .
now the
nm , very beautiful , b is , now i know , it 's behind c .
or , god is me in order to have a b i wanted a stay , and i wanted to do so . that 's it of it and it 's .
or you would say , but
what do you mean ?
it 's not no .
<unk> .
why is it not ?
very beautiful .
why is it why is it <unk> ?
yeah , exactly , that 's wrong .
it does n't seem i 'm more than if was a
but they 're like to be , <unk> the <unk> this this is a new , fun .
so , the thing they 're doing have is really
all of these things do there , i do n't know , six and , yeah , i ca n't have
so , it 's really all a lot in . .
there 's a under the door . .
and it 's always going to be a third behind a door .
you can guess what they want to do with two characteristics of them in the <unk> .
that means they be course in little doors , do there , you can do it at
but here we have a door .
so , now the one , thing this is , two third is not what they guess of .
so , the little third here , but it can only be behind a door .
it 's not .
so , on what this is more . .
no , i really get going a matter earth of . .
so , on what this this is more . that so ? .
it 's better to stay , right n't ?
now it 's just , yeah ?
yeah , of course !
so , that was not later the <unk> n't and <unk> all n't n't ?
ha !
what do we see ?
they had <unk> in .
why ?
very pretty simple , two third are not a hundred percent , the difference between theory and services .
i hope it was for everybody .
thank you .
gentleman
but i 'm going to <unk> my best that it was all over again the way . .
i come from the
and i had to look `` well .
yeah , yeah .
thank you very his invitation and i other and it -- and i way . .
i grew up here . and i grew up here .
and i do n't know if 20th
i got .
clearly the motivation is not bad and it
i also have to have to have a full that i did .
so today , it was a
and i 'm up at the <unk> anyone you do at the rain i do n't . .
so who wants to be a
i said , i -- i said a little data , i 'm
and i started to go to the pushing with it .
no worry to do the beautiful , little bit of the
i did n't would think about it to know what we 're
so , i come from the
trust , of course , not in the <unk> , but in think that
why tell the system , where i am ?
for me , one of the important stories , that i really come from the country from to come these village that come from the class and grew here with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> .
and with the second brother , the same thing is like i .
that this for the bottom you can see is the natural and dark , which is what i can see where <unk> giant window you can see , whether it 's light is . and it so
what today today is very common is for <unk> and the
and we can look `` you can see , if you have those and something . .
and
the theme of old men and
always to look at the way .
and what was very important is the idea of how to trust trust and can see this big trust , the <unk> in which so that we all need to do , this this this kind you need a little women , i think .
and that was a lot of parents that for my parents , in he the brother of my brother and i do n't know the minds and yet .
we were so the first that are very wants we have in their lives .
and then they had to do on the situation . .
and now , i am
a would have been done but 's going we have to get over making . .
and b , when our parents have look 're interested they were able to go to us to go to the world to go , things now to go and to said , in when when so our amazing situations is .
so in the house , in to the house , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , it also . of the way and it so . and
there so the speaking brother i years about <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
the <unk> of to the
so this they '' about to the big brothers -- these are not just good for the elbow but the <unk> .
and our brothers and my brothers and i went to <unk> . it so really made all the way going out out of on what the ma could do , especially in to the example . .
and that has a
and then we started to go with
the
but we 've got this starting to
and then the big question is : how did to do it there ?
and how do you trust the trust , the trust of parents , that the kids new and the
and our solution was , of course , of course , of course , is , in idea , where do the <unk> , where are the <unk> , where are the
and we had to be able to notice in him in the side of the other hand to the other hand .
and you be course , now , there are people in here in there a test , going to do they '' because it 's going to be like that it are nothing here .
but <unk> . if is it , of the told , and they 're up in their shoulder by their might be course .
can you try to get
so , as i 'm going a lot in the bats , you '' say to be
and this this this is for them , and so trust the movement , always really important .
but <unk> to what they have
and i 'm going a lot of trouble , you know , a every big trouble , of course , without a lot of medication , and of course , of course . .
what so i do `` unfortunately i do n't have pictures of them a 'll be <unk> , here , by like one in our <unk> and million .
which is based with the
i wrote , the mechanics for a <unk> diversity .
and i 'm very literally the very literally to the
never like in the way of to be trying to be used . and they were able it . .
but also , they my own , in course , of course , we ca there , that 's not going a lot in the way . .
diversity is in the
and our brother just again to get sexual and always
so then said , okay , we 're going to show is i 'm up it . and then was a <unk> .
there 's i can as it 's the seriously effort of
and the <unk> went down to
but the started , their own over the discovered ? .
so i do n't .
and i think about to to the other a few , 's the generation of young women , not .
and so that -- i 'm always going to go .
and then even i are the consequence that 's going to look `` look `` the
because trust is , of course , if other means and others of know of it of . .
so the fun father said , about instead of god , help , go i would with the danger of the danger of the fear of fear that have look ``
but never happened .
and he always who had to go of are so <unk> that he had
and that was a great thing that i was very idea that we had these opportunities .
but clear , not opportunities i do n't have a show to do that , to something like science .
for me , the different boss your life were always important the way in just my work the interesting .
and all of all of know , they were able i could see , because it was like i do in the limits , what 's my own that in of .
so to <unk> good <unk> , i could never be . .
i never had the <unk> .
and i do n't like to go to <unk> . and it 's not like to as right .
i go to go going to go out in fat .
not in five degrees of the experience .
and at
but i always discovered in my strength we discovered that i 'm able a down in the other hand that i 'm going to do .
the she 's those to be
and that was very beautiful , because it are in i had it in i look 're in to the <unk> the <unk> , i look `` technologies , we have <unk> times
it 's actually good , because you 're up with next every something else and going it .
and then you see what the other power is .
and there was so my big trust , of course , if i 'm up with a lot of a around a around , we '' it was difficult , out because the other might be what i do n't .
so there 's just a method : and that 's the trust in my backyard .
the other kind in the <unk> of to the <unk> , let them go go back i can said the
i 'm not going to do they ?
i had to think of it . . . .
i think that so that -- this have been a little bit of going i 'm going to do .
and that so i who had something that i have now ? of course , right ?
<unk> .
crap , i 'm going to be
okay .
the next for them is able a lot of things in working on working on school and the
my parents were home or are
but for me , in school , i think , how can i move a around school to go to school to get my goals at the school ?
and then it had i had a possibility to make a way is to make i think of the school .
and even though i always again thought , it 's all the
i found a lot that i had a which it 's to ? .
and then i said , well , i 'm going to go with
and then you think of course , the person the country , the person , it was to the big invisible in a sports , because you need to have
``
this this this is the <unk> of the
and you 're very paper , if you 're going i have the full trust in the own technology .
so if you can trust the trust , so the force that is that is that is the doing the same conditions , in the bad weather , to a
and if you also have the team you have in the team .
because as a <unk> , that does there , i am
and i never happened to something our
but does n't make it again , we 're doing we again .
and it 's what 's going to be , we might as well .
take if like if you have if is one of them , like one of them . .
and what i 'm going to do is actually trust to
in to <unk> and . you have two months in the hand .
so , sure i ? i do n't give you hand , you will take from the
does n't .
so i have to help me different .
i got these <unk> to go it .
and the voice with them . and the voice was . .
so that 's always going a way a lot of the <unk> and the way in the did of the way and it so .
and that 's important for trust .
the precision is you in the communication to the <unk> .
and the <unk> <unk> says i years , which have
if he says , left on 10 little bit of the left , and when he says , right on 10 .
okay , all understood n't ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because i have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able a lot , and i have it to say the way the way it 's not true that 's business .
and for me , it 's very big , critical , i think a around to them the <unk> a little data , i have to be completely <unk> i really to only tell 's commercial .
to say positive , it so for know , the tools you can have to be able we have we really have it quickly , in to be a by to be fast as other , as other , to the same <unk> and the same .
and that 's or very , if i do it , with two poor me the <unk> , i have a <unk> the way a leg , and i really have to make the eyes , ha ha , or you can also go . and you as well to make 's open .
and then and 've got so <unk> of and 've got to go and then go about to the other leg and the use , in the time , and you can have a even thing to be i 'm up , do n't have a little data .
also about high school .
yeah , and that so have the key thing how i 'm going to do is , how do it i say the guy , because it 's could actually be just men that we could only got a
so they all think that just . .
so i 'm going to get the did the way to communication .
and this this this is now like in 'll every
if someone did n't know , of course , i can not help me , of course , but i 'm up that , and i 'm going it to say , well , i think , `` well , i think of the curve , maybe
or i think of the one you like now the time it 's going to say to me , as long as the mountain is , because if we <unk> the <unk> , you know to you , it 's going a moment to as well and it some . .
and it 's going about up as
and there 's the where it 's a pilot , like the
so that 's why it are able to have to have the idea in which to have <unk>
i 'm going to stop
who is here n't ? .
so my best time was , there are in i , is in to september , in the april , i 've said , in april , i 've show it very much more faster now people :
and in to the <unk> of the <unk> .
and for me , how said , these kinds of <unk> do just come how we have from my ears . .
and the other thing i 'm telling me is exactly what he looks like to ? . .
and this this is a very able to do in the very important stuff that i say , trust is more training and not that
so let so say , 're not so much as say to the
because i had the experience that i had a <unk> of a
and then it are bad at to to be almost bad , out out of the speed is three feet <unk> .
and i am to
so , as i said , that was at i , you know , of course . .
i know , because the <unk> are going it to go down to , so you have to be
and i 'm going to think in these days the where 's people got to say , left and say , `` <unk> , the other left .
so then , then said the right , unfortunately .
it often good in the daily lives of the lives of the time in the daily . and they ? that
but clear , in <unk> action with pressure , you know to all of the work , or the college of the crisis i have to go .
and then of course , sadly to be health is
but for me , how said , `` <unk> trust trust , i have to know the risks .
and there 's because so i have to say , i 'm as someone who does n't see , relatively big in the advantage because it so it 's the compared a risks in many ways .
so on
on it
and then you people can be able to be able to be able to be able to do the ended . and that 's what the trust is .
and if you found someone , to have we have a hundred percent of so
and with the same back the same goals .
because this this this is the technology , of instance to trust the next , very important .
you need the goal , and i have to be really certainly reasons to on on what does we think that this they do this ? .
because of course , it 's matter as much more than the track in the did .
i do n't know that very , or myself .
but the very able to do they have this back a lot of . of it also . .
you 're going a lot of them for position . .
and that you also , because we 're going to have <unk> . so we want to have a around <unk>
and the sense of meaning , you health is that so we new to achieve the goal in i ? .
we do there do that do in just a moment the case that it was a him , center that i went a little used to <unk> in the <unk> that .
and there 's what 's going a lot that i 'm going a moment the way we be point to ?
and how do you look at the mountain on the mountain , right there ?
well , of start , of course , the big responsibility , i did n't have to who i do there are not going to see , like this , like , for example , to talk it to think of a hundred feet .
and then i was very
can be <unk> advantage , it so is not our ago . .
and i 've right now working can also been on to the <unk> to <unk> of a
it 's been
and these things are always interesting to me .
now to what you on to what 's going it to have to have the
and the <unk> <unk> little data , how to be
you go and go and just stones around it a lot of plants .
you take the
so if you look `` the
and us then world a lot that 's more exciting and then and then of the way .
we just saw the villagers from the distance or the other .
so i 'm up with
because i thought , `` well , as we said , `` it 's going to be faster , like to to be <unk> and <unk> in the thing .
but as i said , it 's not small <unk> , because you 're not up to be was not so much change .
and right , it 's going to be exciting when it 's going to be difficult .
so if you go into to the same
or if it 's next to the
and then it 's very beautiful and when it 's also at night and then ``
because i was a matter getting
trust , we 've been created that it 's just now i also said , `` of from from my friend , from my friend , to instance a hundred percent of the way a lot in and so we have the
but i have a lot of a
and all in the where is you up i years the way you 're up .
so for us to position in to the true case , we 're looking for
in the other <unk>
and she 's also going i 've also been able to look '' with the foot with the foot , or with her
and what the children really did but this is how beautiful it is , if you look at the top of the top of the top of to the top of the top , you think the goal is going a bit like a little bit like , not now now now like the <unk> .
but the other hand this is that it 's like i told this the trust , which for them is in them the way , `` you think , `` i 'm going a really <unk> weight . from how i 'm more
but the trust is also in want to be in want to see a
and when we were at the blind of a mountain , we were in i just left a year you 've look `` the want of to the no seven collaborator of where and we 've right now , and i 've got a little women and it are , big to us , say what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
at area , you can do to look at the girl on the over and look ``
it 's kind of not the reason .
and then i ended which , county , ah , ok the position in their skills this this is also quite it also . .
you 're going to go through to the dark , you go to 12 o'clock in the dark , and then you ?
this is totally
and then finally to look at the moment where the wait said the person this they did are actually completely
so the believe that the believe of she tells us about first , and the other in to the group of the group of the group of the group of the
or i did n't tell you what 's going to do is not going to be about to the mountain .
and that so , it was another like that you sort is just about <unk> can talk not about it , and 's just as i think , it 's just <unk> kept the developing hour .
and the things in the outside of the outside of to trust trust they can be <unk> , of course , is you can be able a personal pump the week .
and for me is trust , and then it was perfect , if this is a weeks that 's up of to the weeks and on on what 's really going i no way the idea of the idea of the thank you
and that so , of course , in to the sports of to the childhood , you ? it 's not not about does that to n't be able we do n't know how it 's not it i do n't know to test the land , by whether so it 's just a scale have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
so i think of a lot that it so , in fact , it 's like this i was i up be <unk> that are them
if it had all real gold , i do n't get here the way i would get be on the <unk> and i think .
or at least in <unk> , the
but as i said , `` the real thing you do is that is more , you be able to imagine , what was i third and how did i have my slide in the want to be in a point .
and as i 'm this in my ability , but of course , in the team that we need to do n't lot , whether in the time the per job . . .
no , if old man or young woman , we need people who be able to trust .
and if we have this weight in to the audience , that 's going it , in fact the best especially evidence in a far project in our lives . .
and if you can be start a lot that you can do it in other areas .
thank you very much
a science for me , that 's to the consume of my talk the story have said to the
what makes think of this this is the very <unk> of the
basically , i could be satisfied .
if i 'm in we
even every single
every one in the world is 're `` at terms of an
even , it 's totally
every program made it kind that have a little women in the <unk> , but yet that 's a visual
science is one thing that i 'd like to look at me , i know to community , but that 's not myself and people ? .
cool , cool is just kind you kind of kind of sort that
in fact to be a <unk> play five third , has process history with the reality , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there 's well i can identify that .
big bang , i can laugh , i can ? it does there , but it 's great .
this this this is extremely bad .
because that 's kind of a little paradox that we 're going to do is going it to be able we can start with these technological happen that are in it . and that so
but at the use , none of itself . of yourself in itself .
i 've got a few examples of a between science or science and science you just what 's going to do and we have to ?
a very <unk> example , in london , you have a nice
what happens is now that the values camp in to the top of the top , i have it
this are big come through the press , but unfortunately , there was i a secret in the press .
bad , the heat has so <unk> is that this poor
now to imagine the senses of the architect , that does all have 's kind of kind in physics because i mean , is completely new , really much in the way you 're going to go . .
so , what it was found this is very
i really wonder what has more design or architect or where did he have ?
now , this this is a very <unk> example .
an
and
there was the train in the train because
genes was a lot of the green and green <unk> .
genes were kind of how got ready in .
``
there were situations where the market has right , hey , hey , i have <unk> ugly .
no idea that should people , growth and . .
so , yeah , okay , let 's start about they '' we can solve it .
but at the time i was in to the developed in to the lab , and i was able it to be really floor a little women , because i tried to get these evil genes in my bacteria , that
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my <unk> magazine when is , ``
i like , yeah , i 'm trying a few gene in my bacteria , and that does there . of all .
that was what i tried to explain to explain , so let are kind that a
that was what i was like the <unk> , and a pay sequence i wanted a lot of the . .
but that was what the woman has been . of . .
this woman has went to me again . .
who knows what i am
genes is what 's going a lot of . .
now , this is a good 10 want to be a good years each where it 's kind of a kind that kind in consciousness .
genes , this this this is clear .
i did all read more . .
and it 's always a green bit that 's going it , and it 's actually going to be in when 's what 's up in when we do so .
<unk> can go a headline .
now a lot of different corn is a around other tea , which is not in to the dog . .
another headline , <unk> , they '' to die . .
yeah , that was a beautiful headline .
but they 're people like old , and it 's also relatively not , on on what 's up a no way .
no matter me the time or the picture , all talking about <unk> .
fortunately , it 's not going i 'm not <unk> in the <unk> of to
but that shows with what uncertainty in a population is , out because they do n't do can not be with to the themes in i .
we need to have in out of our future with these technologies .
now , now i was just
and this this this is pretty sad .
so going to look 're in to the lab in the lab ?
if we suppose that little , young running running scientists in his lab , a experiment , a truth , a truth , beautiful and good , and he thinks , man the person to be what 's interested in the public .
and 've got to go to the professor . .
the boss , to the boss , right , cool theme the name of say , it was always a happy , that was space in to ♫ <unk> in science .
good idea , i do n't still go you in the public , it 's going to be a <unk> that 's going a
yes the
and
so that 's going to get
now , he 's not i have i 've look at the globalization you have a green <unk> i have a common amount that have a common amount of <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all these are the <unk> , the <unk> memory , then then they my
that 's the way .
by the basis , it 's always going a little women , the
these are a lot you like a lot of a lot of a lot of a around , there so this is all right , there -- this for all of all , is the way that we 're here to do , but who are i going to do ?
basically , just the ones that are lost . .
in the <unk> , we 're going to call that to to the
so the one you 're interested in is the
beautiful magazine , the <unk> that are interested in that , of course the idea of what 's going to be you , you 're going it in these articles and . and
and who 's going we to ?
the <unk> that it 's lost .
it -- that 's now the <unk> . i call him `` election '' . we call point <unk> and couple of the want to see want to see want to do we what i do n't us to do it .
yet , again , our future are up we as a did the way we 're going a lot of these <unk> .
bruce a
my project , so my idea is , unlike the <unk> the little , young , young scientists from
so , on the most important thing the scientists , i 've got i have i have i have i think that we know , we know , for a ; it are <unk> , just
when he told the mouth , and over his job , he told actually
and
and
<unk> treated to be i , oh , you do n't know what it this is .
so the really <unk> , listen we are beautiful and good , if you 're on a conference , of your people , your <unk> the <unk> , you know , you can say a lot of them a
where is the problem , it really really
so , it 's my idea , these young scientists who are not so far in the hierarchy of <unk> , which are i a little bit of serious , the school i had a little data .
this has a use ,
finally , that was to the way you 're using the did you what for to do this a lot you have a lot you have a lot in and to be course .
but that so , you know , that 's just a story .
and i want to put it into 's we have it in we have it , you know to imagine a project , the both side that was a project , a project , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , honestly the way we n't do .
there are a quote , i do n't know whether it are really , think that
so , the scientists of the developed and the project really began i think a project is going a way a lot in the use that i can communicate ?
so , there so many built stories . and it 's been a lot that . and
and
if is the thinking that the city of the city in the university of some <unk> , and 've got a tell is to
these are the things you from doing and . that
i 've got my <unk> and again of my approach in . .
so , these are the people who are interested in the did that they '' and they from there but they '' in the way .
this is beautiful , there are some
so i 'm up to say i 'm going a second thing a second thing to got to say , it does n't be in this <unk> both project .
these scientists are also going to be able to do , going to be the same believe is going to be kids ?
because many really <unk> have been able i have a lot that we have to reduce the key and the key in to the risk in the way of to . and
because scientists , and more as five some has the has study for to get a natural some world .
kids work very strong .
they 're going to learn how a lot you do and they my own of .
they try and work ?
and
kids learn extremely important .
these are actually
this is normal !
but that 's a lot of <unk> and a around .
and so i think , really , really , actually to work , if you get to the <unk> , of the environment to the environment , in the environment , in the environment , in the environment , in the middle in the street the street the children , and they then really do that and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and then you might be , maybe , long , that 's like my america , tell the five of a kids , of the time to go sense , and then i 'm going a brilliant
and this this is not somewhere in the newspaper , it was people you my might tell looking at him the way that it worked on the
and not just , of course , `` of start , mr.
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
sadly , it 's just about that to the first <unk> that i 've got to most said to said the
a scientist has to ?
yeah , i think , okay , i 'm more going a look `` next .
but who kind of work you work is in a company , in a company , there 's the bit of the next .
thank you .
i am crazy . .
fly can not fly every day .
the last weeks were terrible of the last weeks .
the weather has done i have we made a big picture of to the bill .
seven years ago , eight years ago , i was asked if we want a way a way of . .
i was before , states a 10 way in and
we 're going a lot to book in to process of the process .
they who have said ,
and for me , it was more , well , that 's <unk> and <unk> .
what does that mean ?
and
and it so it 's what we 've learned of that york and that so it 's what i am here . and it 's here .
and yeah , it 's a little crazy , but it 's a back to every case .
it 's beautiful and always exciting of it , and we ? .
and i 'm going to just give they a little bit of the technology , a little bit of minutes of a little used to do a little bit of a
i 'm
the company has been since a hundred and a
i 'm
this company has been since 20 years .
and the
the company has been about
this have to be the <unk> you ``
rio .
this this picture i make here for you to each one of you , that is actually i could where we '' i do all to do for it , and you would there , you know , do all know a little bit , right , right the may be to a great thing in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
there are just
and it 's actually only about city .
that 's what 's going on .
there are about 20 miles of global warming .
so this this this is not a market .
it 's not even i think in a moment in the did and . and we ?
this is an
and the question is , why do you do that ?
how does they ? .
<unk> and only 10 times , we can talk about why this this is like that .
very short .
<unk> has been <unk> by need a lot of crazy .
very short .
has been
then in the first war ,
and then they show the progress and so on and so forth .
and when we got
so this is the part that 's going with a
and we had a property campaign .
but <unk> , the client was n't so uncomfortable up out because it 's been clear to him , what was all that old memories there -- the !
and well a little data was a little bit of a back .
but yet , it was a good campaign in london , except the weather in the north , many years ago , very bad of all a little other other way .
and we 're not shocked .
and 've got a lot in six other years each other , and actually
and there was we got i got a lot in the
this has a invitation that has said that to the whole german nation has also felt first , as a
and there -- it -- in to new students , in say , in new york .
and the whole german nation is <unk> , we are
this is in all of a
but actually , then , then
ladies and a speak of things about
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> and then the she was the first life of <unk> crash the crash , but unfortunately , yeah in the time .
next to the most that 's the event the event the event to where it was it , of it , if this is a product , and then they went to the same now and they went to it of to go that . .
the want to ? of course ,
and then
the materials used have
and then there do there were six years ago and then . .
and then the <unk> of
and i got
yeah , he 's all the market ?
what is there ?
so .
we 're talking about it .
and to
there are many companies who came just these
it 's <unk> employees , about 20 billion revenue . .
this is a right way . 's a real way and <unk> in the way and it was .
there 's a lot of it .
and then they also convinced me to put here .
and to be it , in fact , a very several efficiency of the normal efficiency also the size in to be , n't , i bit , <unk> to the perspective the gas , which this is not a gas , and also an
is like a force in the real , which this is on , you have to ?
and time they 're people to student the way in detail .
in the way , it days is now now , with a structure .
there are two <unk> of the
there 's
they ? the inside this this is not the attention , of the way they ? .
these are most of to that
and there 's just as i also said , and it look 're at natural <unk> you know a little data , of start , of system , so on a few did of the line of the age that so . .
so this this is how the excited is going to come going to be <unk> of the system .
on a structure . .
and the brain is much more <unk> and the way of the way that . .
come these
mo when to
<unk> , at the time , there -- the roots are . .
one of the reason they '' costs two million dollars a lot is . .
and it so some
and there -- there -- there -- the <unk>
and at the end of the way , you who see the
so the alphabet they do they have i mean it this
and that 's what you see here on the numbers , very short .
one of nine percent , one of nine percent , one of four person
it 's very very little and very good .
this is an
that people be course .
but there 's a down carefully that makes us right now , and i 've right here on process of the top .
we had <unk> percent that we started to have
and this year in maybe so 's what so we were at
when this this was began a eight years , my eight years , and <unk>
we are
we can not fly up can not fly through fog .
you want to see something . .
and the <unk> and
so a little bit of the one that our weather is not going a way i felt , but we 're going to do the weather every day .
but because this this is so good , this they 're good to something a innovation for
i 'm going to come from finland these knowledge from dam . .
the way this for the way , then this for the way this is <unk> a
<unk> is called the campaign and the campaign and . that 's what 's going to be and
and we do
that information this means
and the <unk> t
over many of it the many law that are the beginning of the air , not now now up not how on our things that we do to ? .
there so , it 's how it 's going a way the top of to the top of the top . of to the second . of the same back and the second kind is . .
a great story . of course . .
and is if is like you something like this the point in a theme of article .
so that 's very good .
and here are some
this this is about nine week or <unk> week .
and in finland , the weather is a called
the <unk> say that they did there .
i 've just got it in it , looked `` beautiful days .
and the mosquitos were not so bad .
we were in africa .
and have been looking for de <unk> as
you not can home , it are all africa , and then you know the way you ask to says the idea that you ask , to sense , this thank you the real cities , it was good `` to to be a <unk>
i asked , what do we do that ?
and what do we do there ? .
in a end , we were also done in little years .
and the <unk> other did n't go .
the entire
and a lot you 've look '' in to the mast you where we time he will stay down . .
but not was people .
we had a good child i had to be guys .
that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what i should do . .
yeah , what we do today is a very quick <unk> that 's from a little used of
what we do today is that we 're more about sudden it so about complexity , it 's about questions , growth very ,
what we do today is the <unk> in
we 're going to do , of course .
we have to get rid you have i what 's up .
<unk> is <unk> that .
there are always <unk> to 10 , which they have a lot of , and again the way . of the way of the way of it that you what 's more .
we 're going a whole lot you 're more likely a whole
and that are what we 're talking about , so we 're talking about .
we do we need a lot that we do . and we 're up to do that of . and
we 're a container is <unk> the most violence in to to be
this they 're his
the question is : do is actually going i go on there ?
do you want to go ? that 's going to be ?
do you make bigger
there 's
what do you do ?
do you go to the market ?
do you go to the way all n't ?
and that 's what we also decided it in my time .
and there are a between a couple in
and not as we on the <unk> in to have it <unk> , and the
at the beginning to a
the population of the german population has saved him with six million <unk> than a 1929 the fourth of the fourth , that he was basically <unk> , the population has done a donation .
and it 's all a lot that has look `` the
we were in tokyo , the
we were , and they hear past , in san francisco with a customers .
it are a very small
both projects are unfortunately . .
so <unk> .
at a same where we won the
i do n't have a picture of this up out out because we ca n't show that
but in america , in taking the world was the first <unk> of the first <unk> .
we have sold day . .
and with . 's how are 's going to make it with it about a partner with a cell mean . .
and that 's a big success , but the same thing i years . .
two customers have been <unk> , because it was n't .
why did n't it go ?
we actually think we know of .
either , to do there was not to to be the right , or the nurses see , or is in america , you know , you know , the last 30 years of years i 've had the better 30 did the advertising .
and to the
and there 's people who did n't know that you can be there . .
and it was actually a typical leave in mission to make the outside that , hey , people call and <unk> .
``
the tumor
but last year , we only have <unk> . of weather and weather of the same that .
there are a 20 million .
it was bad .
the redwood of to <unk>
it 's the sense of course , of course , as i see , if i look at the nurses of the nurses and and at at at at all , and we also do n't make i do it , and we 're going to have a mouth that so we on it that we ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and we 're great . and we 're fantastic .
and i 've always got i have it to go with to the mistake that we would think 's
you could still make more .
we have this
it 's not true .
we 're doing advertising .
this is a lot you 've said that
and the
but the <unk> is a difficult market .
and you also have to ask the <unk> : does cup always make sense ?
we actually have enough advertising , but the internet has a lot of changes that are
the <unk> so
we have three here .
two active , one , to
so then six of 10 .
we 're going to do in i the worked when it 's one in to do the market .
and hope to be able to be able to be able to be course .
and what the end is david scott , ed and .
so <unk> is beautiful .
we ?
we n't find customers .
and we year , 's going a great value , we on the activities that 's box .
we what we have . .
this this this this is not .
it is
so this for a <unk> period the time you around . and you need it . and you have to world . .
and then there 's no time .
there are a fighting architecture that 's easy a easy to yes . .
it was the situation , <unk> , a point in the car the world , will not be it .
yet we 're going to go .
it 's a icon that region .
the <unk> have to ? .
you or just ask a question : on what shape do we do ?
how much money are we going to get into to the car there ?
what do we do for here ?
what 's up to the shape ? .
and i personally to got to say something personal , i am the of course of course of these
and it was also
and then there was a <unk> that were
there are know can them to be to <unk> and
and i 've been able to do day for three years , as an
zero , right ? 45 dangerous , i am trying to go that . of thank you .
sebastian betti
yeah , thank you .
these are my three dots that i want to do you in the <unk> minutes .
why are we in the <unk> of the <unk> there there there n't ?
how do we come a twist at the tracks all ?
and all of what do ?
what 's what 's up ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is maybe a little bit of sand and a little bit .
but it 's also looking at to show the challenges .
a few years ago , the more leave to explain that .
we have a problem today , every child .
we have problems of problems that we have .
but it 's always going a little used to the time that we have i would on the problem in the example . . .
all kinds of <unk> -- exponentially . of course .
if you look at the
now 's if 's not what 's going to do , 's kind that it 's kind of kind in terms in terms in the did in the way . that 's going to go down and again and again .
they know mother , the last <unk> did .
some say , well , there were the where we were in a year to the started to look at the last <unk> did . .
you can look at <unk>
you can say , who needs ?
you can say the sea is far away .
but it 's going to go a thing a thing to do with a little data , to really challenges to avoid things that you 've then really avoid , 's going to be possible on it in to the
<unk> is about 30 degrees of 30 sign .
and there 's a degree of the did in when in our cities like in pottery very , like to be more like , which this is more . .
but it 's also about the <unk> , especially in asia
think of the himalayas where the big streams they 're going to come of and the
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is the <unk> that we do , there were a every larger crises and there was a lot larger crises and . .
and then
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts come up . .
it india have space .
this is the age of the age will to as an
and that 's all right ? .
these things do n't think you 're going a lot of things in which one by the such a lot you have we have it with the global <unk> .
with what we 're going to get how we harvest .
not only , the oil and the water of them you and the minerals the resources but they ? that 's the thought that you my might as well .
and we 're just going to look at that the other way as heard of it , to make a lot that we can use a told and use tons that we have to use that . .
so it 's about the <unk> of the <unk> , the children had been used i had a whole
this is the challenge , not just climate , not only encourage
different .
our technology is ted . .
if we look 're going to look at the ground and cats you '' in the earth , and there are still in the earth that live in the principle of the principle of the world they '' in the last year . and the last year
in an
now , we 're going to have it to <unk> and
so <unk> has a
and he 's very , very low <unk> with earth .
it 's more than the fear you '' in north korea , more back to time . .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , very much less .
and it best , we 're going i put the implications of us , the rivers , the air is a lot better in the last decades but it so is lives you have a every parts you have in want to have to have a parts is . and
and the other parts of the world , but they design happened and less and less .
and therefore the conflict we see in of
and this this is , there 's a lot of them the way i data , there are many resources things where the <unk> that -- the . and the <unk> that --
so if we want to go to it the way , we have to been with a reward .
so we need to change the ground meter , the <unk> is all over and the
and what we have on
this has been <unk> calculating as he said , the world has enough for the world , but not for the world was missing in the world .
and there 's going to be as we 're going on you in average , in forward . .
so .
that was a lot you were part of the way .
but i always think that you need to understand what so it is worth a way we lot and find on what . .
and when i would say , it would as well people like that the way to using it , which is more sophisticated of know that . of the way and it 's like you . .
but it 's always a way to be it the <unk> , ? it so i years , say to you of the way of the <unk> and i think and . and i think and . .
so what 's time ?
and there are that was that 's where 's where so we have to minutes you have in because of our rich , we with in because we have a lot of the world in a rich way in low quality that we do all of to the same where 's not need a around people '' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you know , you think of if you think , also a around people who do n't can ? . .
i wrote there .
and
we 're working on a lot of time of trying we work that . .
this is the both side of the hand the did we come is in stress the side of them the did . .
i love to work . .
and on the other hand the
what is a good life ?
how can we define that ?
now , you '' an little used a thing a little bit that we what so . .
and what it i said , and what i 'm going to say is , i way to say , is a lot of a lot of a lot that , do it , but here 's on how can it the than first where i ? and it --
and there 's important to understand quality of life has been all president that . . .
quality has been to the objective conditions like it has it . .
did i have a roof over the head ?
did i mean ?
did it be a relationship , i can be able a lot in work n't ?
but what 's on the want to do is how do it go a ? .
i 'm up be course of the other evidence .
and then i 'm up with over two ways that are important to the way .
one is needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human development , of because of our human development , it 's going a lot of the feelings . .
if we can solve our needs , we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs needs or not sustainable .
needs to do n't have a lot of applications of the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> that
what are needs ?
you can call a different causes that we have in were two .
and there are the physical grow , but also a lot of things that are going it to social condition .
after learning to be
all of it has to do with money .
but in a big part of the part of it the way to do , but to ?
and there 's what we 're going to do with to the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy i use a need a grow to me . .
and there 's what 's going to go how we can ?
i can need a lot of money or a thing . .
strategies are just my behavior like i do from my needs .
this some of to do with my values , with the resources , with to the opportunities that i have .
if i have a thing to make a lot of money , it 's up to be able it to start with the way we have a lot of money on the rest you what it 's going i do and . .
it 's about to get a <unk> the roof , which this is the roof over the head , and then to pay the <unk> .
and here 's what it 's going to do is , that be a around or little
and if we have the whole strategies that we have to have to have to have to have to have from from my needs , then we talk about a lifestyle .
so .
that was a lot of scientific <unk> .
and now is about on what can we do now ?
how do it go ?
and there 's just a few evidence and just . that
of course , that 's also going it to find each other .
but the evidence of the individual type you what this for a technical way is , i think the lot of technology had right now , and finally , in i also the red way and a changes .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
the slides in the beginning , the danger is , that we 're going to use more or which this this is more resources and more resources .
now the last of a quality of life , of system the effects are always going to be worse the effects , and we '' in to get over the started to get back to us .
or whether we create the other direction that are in i have we can look `` less
there 's a
there 's a lot of technology , how be a matter that we use the family , the orange to a computer i do , the coffee , to the car the same i ? and how ? .
i not make we be course , it can build the house of wood , which for wood and <unk> and <unk> of them .
in turns out a around a every lot of <unk> , or to create to create to the same quality . .
my other teachers , the
where are the needs ?
what services can i happen n't ? .
and how can i do that with some
and not with a little bit of a little bit ,
there are many examples of the way . .
in vienna , a <unk> is built with yet
with seven <unk> , it 's built you in
it 's basically made . .
you can do we not need a lot of them you not need to be able to be course , and then they 're going a lot of a lot that , in to as a lot of a lot that we '' in at a lot of resources , of the moment , and is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but it 's also a lot of our before , as
``
where he shows how hard it is , 've look at it from the kind that kind is like to some you from to ? of the way . .
the <unk> , i want to go down to the other , and then i 'm going it in this race in in have . .
you have a lot of them the way that i have fast you that it 's hold up of a little data , and then i 'm going to get the new .
at to the most beautiful
and when it was a child i had a few years ago , we wrote the 20th . of the time of the time .
and 've got to wait to the vote of to the below the letter , i 'm more <unk> in a
i do there are 40 emails and i 'm going to do . and
and i can afford a lot more .
this is productivity , that 's economic growth , we 're going to go back to it .
but i did n't really get time a every where i do .
i did n't have i done have been done .
but there are good examples , happy
and with a small way that they ? of life . .
one of my favorite is
there 's right now , there 's a around the forward , the key person in germany in cheap , is be about 500 go things in the household .
can you start to count .
who had two , three generations of things had been things to what had had
we on the equipment that we have .
we need to do with it .
and always , less people come a lot of it with these whole options .
and you lot to make we lot that help actually make actually <unk> be able i 'm up about these few things .
now , for example , i 'm without without the did a lot in the spaceship of the spaceship , and i 'm going a lot of the things that so i do n't have to do we there . .
the next example is use . . . . .
a very exciting gets . and it so
star and
in the meantime , there -- more one people , like you had to think about
if you think of
platforms , <unk> just work about how to do that a beautiful
and on what even kind that even spend are or going to use better .
this is a question of justice . .
i 've right an shown of think that it so is the billion of africa and europe and europe of the world .
and so the same time the use of these resources can be able i can do is just going i use that if 's going to be less .
and that 's not less quality , out , how many of us have been able to have a lot of us .
but it 's a important problem of the economy , the businesses , these products , these services to what we need to have a good life to create a good life of a every lot you .
last aspect of this for the big politics is to do with to do with the growth ,
if you read a little bit of the outside a little used the way , and then it -- <unk> to <unk> , and the
it means yes , a region that is what we think in my view , and what 's what 's going a lot of with economists have been talking about , and you what do is the online for austria the numbers for at all countries , you last are by the bottom
and there are no reason to have growth , like , now to think of my permanent years . .
for part that has said that there ? of the most intelligent soon reasons of the way that . .
one of to five 'd five today is was so much like eight percent growth in the size in the other time in the other . of the time and a yet and a 20 'd . that
and the eight percent is what china has today .
these -- these are about where we were talking can . that 's on the time and they 've right .
in the world , if the cake is bigger , of course , is more complicated . .
one percent is still a lot of that so we 're going to get ; 's going a lot that we 're going to do .
but you have to be
we can invest good and so that 's what we can work .
so that was not so wrong how i think he knows these statistics , which this is not going to be on the growth of life and in it .
the economy grows , but the quality of quality are happening they 're in in common asked on a lot is that so we are .
and by the way , and the did also make lead jobs without taken growth , of how we 're going a lot of them of
it 's not true , and then you have to go to to the behavior that so .
and it 's space and space , and again a lot of the time , as i think is , of start with the sun to look '' in the trend , a writing story of they story ,
now , <unk> some <unk>
so this for to do the again , and not to do n't have to do it a lot is to create <unk> a lot you can not be able a lot of growth in terms in our okay .
for example the okay , these okay , and these countries , also for china , there this they are by to along the other story .
and that 's just going i can say the way in <unk> the way the other way so we 're going a way a little place and we just go with this level , on this small against that we 're going a lot of life and the economy that so we 're doing that and
it 's also political . that 's what 's going we need . .
it needs goals .
it takes me to say the economists say . .
it does n't need the growth , but we really want it to also also go in of it in and ask to the question you 're could actually go with the quality of quality of life there ?
is the coming all n't all there ?
and then our politicians measure .
of course , how about a
how do it go together ?
we need a totally aspect you have i had to be able i was ... . of course , we do all the take .
and who 's about think in them , but also to you , do the age that you know , that 's me very down .
what 's going to do you what 's going to do is , 's going to have a colleagues at at all of the colleagues .
you could do something down .
the resources are used to as go that and therefore to do in the resources and people do n't work .
and you have to have the started to make at all of to create a
that so , but you have to do a back .
that means , <unk> the other , more or happened to at at all of it be working in this direction , we can be course the way you people can have we can do as i think of the right products , services , what do we really ? . and what do we do about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
what do we need and what do n't need to do ?
the right politics 200 , to do that and to ? of course . .
a few evidence and it was .
and last of course , the science of course , the science of course the science is still going to be in to the direction of how can we make the growth ?
but unfortunately , nobody did there .
if you look at the flow in the last decade , it 's always going to go down , because it 's not going to be . .
the politics does n't make we ? of course the case have not create growth , but this is the question of how to go to the question , that we have a good life of it ?
so , ``
you know the <unk> of the <unk> . .
with heart , brain , hand , and the last of it , 's going to do so so we need i need . .
thank you .
i 'm
and i love this city .
so this thinking has so need to tell so many stories .
one of them has been a few hundred years ago .
and has right it with peace of food that has said .
and that 's what we 're going to come to do to do , and the story later the still . .
they 're going to do with the british
this is the way in the state of this thinking , in a middle of this city , and a lot of this city is also , and they '' and . .
another story before .
it was in a hot guy they were in <unk> , missouri of
one man is realized up now like in say that we 're going to be
it 's too warm .
he 's europeans , he does n't know that with the heat .
he makes we something in to take a knife i 'm going to take a knife
he 's up in it , and we '' it are up to to be a <unk> that so just is it a his new climate .
it 's the shoe , it 's born .
and these number that you see here is the one of it you see in the <unk> of the <unk>
a company is <unk> , with four letter .
one or other of them knows it .
he made it to
both have been drunk of them and . and
so he says good the
<unk> is going to get a
today the number in
so much to the topic of peace .
why do there not a little used to do what 's not there ?
and behold to be a water question with
if you do n't know , it was n't a chance for what 's a chance ? .
and this water has also helped me to have said the question you have to do in tough situations .
if something was wrong , by my <unk>
``
what is a chance ? of course ? .
and you 're up by a
what 's up to do , it 's a
and another example was seen know me these
and the prove how creative can be people if we go to your might as their own . .
i want to show you a few examples of here and here and i 'm going a few examples .
so these are in to the <unk> of
i am
my son did n't have to <unk> a woman and the music . .
it 's just <unk> , it 's the woman by <unk>
or i had the whole day plants , and i had a
right n't the obvious thing in that ? .
the bush .
the <unk> is
i 've got
but there can think you know a half of the <unk> .
the last i was not about a accident .
it -- the young woman was in the <unk> .
if you 're a man , every other explanation , this they '' is n't going a little used .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i ask wrong and i dreams that we use all of this creativity . .
many of us are in an
and that must people not not as been and not that and .
why not well ?
old things that 's going i have to do that you never have i 've right , me , or <unk> the opposite .
why do there not just make things like this the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit . .
and there 's so
for example , who -- for sort of the <unk> to their own to what for their own the wall , or the wall of example to , of course , and then you might be like that .
one possibility , right ?
and the 2 , rather than
or what 's up and what . .
we do n't have the
is yes , right now , right n't ?
if you ca n't get the direction of something . of the cell . of the phone and you can do it .
or eat me to them , we 're far at least and eat .
rain , but creative .
this they need . .
i think of one of the customers or the
the <unk> of to them of .
an
and the destroy news , spending politics .
if you were three with i was on to the <unk> , you are
once you on a little bit of a thing to pay attention to a long time .
it 's an
it was too much .
they think a lot of what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't be poverty in the kitchen .
so this ca n't have a thank you .
on every table , an
so that the <unk> in to go how it could eat their
just . .
a creative idea , and maybe the <unk> .
there 's a person that does n't just do we 're going to do .
it was the <unk> that
and there are <unk> . of course the woman so . . .
now , the second day , it chinese
a company had
one
the people come to us <unk> .
the buses are full , it 's becoming
but why do n't it kind is to doing first and creative out that ?
sometimes , creativity is themselves going to happen .
and it 's going it these
so we have noticed is that it 's not really good at the <unk> , but that they need we need i need to save it . and it 's also going i have a little place .
or at to the car , in to the car
there are to be to you i would know a different , <unk> , and all kinds of directions .
yeah .
why do n't be i a ourselves a age that you 're going to do , if you 're <unk> n't ?
or at
and all of this they ? with mars , with joy , it 's <unk> to be
sometimes it 's funny .
my sorts of <unk> son was in my office .
and it so on this <unk> and . and it so . .
so , we have several
and then he goes from to a left , he has joy , and i 'm going to tell you in from my loved <unk> , you would say , `` it so is people , not the playground here .
and just to know , i look `` great eyes , playground and playground .
and in the moment , i actually want a moment a right to me , right ?
why is n't in the playground ?
why is that what we do , not the playground for adults ?
it was a around . and ?
if we 're concerned if was we use our talents to ?
and so with
and to say to the script a day i 'm going to get the week of to the week , what 's going to do is in out of our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , of course , our focus on a different day .
so that 's how many made of the other day we would on .
so in the direction of weekend .
and in thank is what you 're up in the media .
in to the <unk> the <unk> , all said i was a made for to weekend and
or if the most important time of to be
what are the same
is it so awful ?
have we at all to do they 're so bodies n't .
one
yeah , i know i do the rest of the rest of the red and the gone .
or in
and we '' it
there 's a around the need of the age you like , and i love a . that 's a around that .
what do is is like that in the <unk> , what 's there ?
and one day i 'm up to buy this business with this business .
and the first sign that you see here is , yeah , that 's actually really nice .
so , with so water work instead of work .
i 'm new , it so father so father so it so i love my take .
yeah .
or even
why do the before you have it to get going i have to get out of the way to ? and it was always going to go and further .
someone else has to as a answer to this direction , it 's not the title , it 's your jobs .
and i actually want to share about the pink glasses , and got to percent and most , ok the time .
what about my job is beautiful ?
the weird over is , even because it so pink suspect , it looks like all the same .
so something bring to tell you that good this this is not beautiful , does n't work .
the pink glasses are
there 's a wonderful thing to projects that you would go in the eye .
but to
where is that like we do there ?
actually the job , the content , our
within the company , outside of the
it may be in a system where we feel like this as a mouse .
the mouse goes up in this wheel and moving you in and go of and go of , in some well the way it 's going to go to quickly , it 's going to take the poor mouse and they 're going to get how . of
what does the mouse do ?
you know , nothing else , they 're going to go in to
and again and important and again , maybe the movie of the <unk> , you might know , you be
this is nice
and what we feel as a points of what 's up as a points of the mouse , you had a separate job the mouse , yes ?
or something needs in fact this
i went to me a lot of years ago when i was on i was home .
and on once the street turned out of me , it was very black in my eyes and somehow it 's going we have to stay .
i went a doctor , and it was a pick , out , because i thought , what 's going on there ?
he went of think and said , `` well the way , is everything all said .
but how do it also look at to the <unk> ?
and i went to my letting we see that , and saw , i was working in any
after 20 did in the <unk> years of <unk> that , to the two years of the first time , if was the first will be wondering if 's in a night . that 's on a night .
i think , on what 's actually it still have to something with medical lead ?
and we started to put it kind is to take other priorities again the time i 'm going a family with my family , something good for me .
<unk> , whether it 's not going a little women in from my job , a new frog .
i 've been able to remember the talks that i ?
i 'm came it to like units you and <unk> and other things , but i have to give you to be able to give you some kinds that are going we have we have a lot of things that do there are really joy .
and that was n't space .
i have to see that that
and sometimes it needs you we need to have this
when i said , you 're going to go with me , he always got them to ? these -- yes , you know the way , you know the way .
it 's going to be able a way of it that
so with
what happens ?
in the bottom , 's going to be healthier .
the <unk> been down , but a curve , the <unk> the diseases that we do this is the amount you have it and
and
earth are
this is something where i think , is is that ?
why is that ?
is it just in austria ?
no , in germany , it 's like this .
<unk> , <unk> , that 's up all healthier .
this is so here on the left side .
so the feet of local attack almost plus a law in to the better 10 way , a big german <unk> .
the number of <unk>
the costs .
and it 's all about 're `` all run , what can we do with this topic ?
and so let -- make i think in the way in idea a lot of the
so , so to be good .
and somebody see , no alcohol they 're not a solution .
but what is the solution ?
what 's on what we ?
and this some years . .
i think , there was so something like <unk> , can it be like this ?
i 'm
there are many other things that are important , family , family , health , and so on .
but the fact is that we spend the biggest part of our own
and if we do that , why do n't do that , that it 's the leg , of course , and the no other .
and to
and these thing that is going i think of it , then you can see it principle .
and
that means how <unk> i mean ?
in on what environment i ? . . .
what freedom is , i 'm here to do what i want to do ?
because is the degree of the <unk> of to the <unk> . .
the more of them , the more stress .
and what do i do ?
the way .
these space ?
and it can be able a look for themselves .
i had to look at a looking for wrong , of all , that 's space . .
can i use my talents ?
what 's going a environment ?
and that means , sometimes i go into it be with from from from my laptop , to put to
the freedom .
what freedom can i do to do to do what is important .
and do i do it ?
the way .
the last <unk> . .
and then there are people to explain why that does n't go .
and why that so much here is much harder .
and then i just like a answer to this point . .
who wants to be able a way .
who does n't , have reasons that . .
and in fact , you can do n't know the way of the did we 're up to do , and we 're going to do the way to do , very , we know ?
and they 're going to have right in both right .
so what do we do with our sugar ? .
every if you have the change of know , it 'm going to look my great
it 's a lot of small .
this this is filled about <unk> , with gold , with all kinds of skills .
what do we do ?
in i would sense that 's going to be , 's going to ask us .
or if we 're in the hospital , or the believe in the believe . .
what did i do with my tracks ?
by the way , who does at
so what do 's do with our weapon is so from my first question , also to young , and it 's going to be every day
``
and resources .
but there was a system . of a system .
i want to tell you about <unk> .
and the <unk> i ? and that --
and they had for i had it <unk> on to
and the enemies believed in in you that this meant so ; they were was so good that you could n't get them .
thick walls are more ways a lot that <unk> <unk>
it are <unk> in time of the time .
so , the thing we again thought this is , okay , we 're which we 're going to go , then we make a <unk> and <unk> that .
we do n't let it out , you 're going to go out .
so let was also also look like a understand that at the time .
and to the <unk> the day , it was a long day , where the <unk> were almost sold of . .
they had only a
nathan ok to
<unk> goes out with a
on the bottom of the enemies , to who are by i or
good , think , a <unk> to what 's going on that .
it 's home .
again , an
enemies think , oh , who 's little
the use of the same scenario again the time , this is the <unk> that 's going to go how to go there of it . and it 's going a way .
at the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> , have seen it in a <unk> .
because they thought that we 're up a long time that we do n't think of it and more .
after , it each want to go down a <unk> that was
one that for think they had <unk> and they what for them .
it 's a
i like this thank you that ca n't have what so we need and that so we what we need .
sometimes it are
but also , 's also what so we be doing .
we do n't have a idea of the power that we have to make to make the world every day .
and if you believe that now , it time now be it right when you 're said , is it right .
in the spring , the spring comes .
it dollars .
and we 're in and
there are where 's well , in idea in themselves , they from these christians . and that so
there are a around that so that are very popular we harvest and eat .
there 's i can be story in to to be to to get it of to to get the
there are some animals that eat .
there are people who are going to eat the products later .
and it comes out . and it comes out .
but if you think about it , it 's not like at all , it 's all the did it be stress of the literally and error of it .
and of course , this threat is just very sensitive of to the world , but by i just to see to the area of the well-being the connection of the <unk> of the plant , and a by the plant is a me , very big role .
there are research that show that until the <unk> today , our second the means that 's one second food is people people do there , if we did n't have bees . .
and so in idea , that 's how it sounds now because it 's so normal for us , of course , and we do n't think of the kilometers .
there were a by a lot of time now , a lot of interesting movie , a 'll really without interesting movie , <unk> the theme .
and i 'm going to do this the way 's up .
but now we 're came i to has i 'm going to look at the gentleman that so on i 'm going to do with bees , in the <unk> the meaning of bees are dream of argue .
and that good my working in
please . 20th
yeah , good evening .
just a big thank you a big thank this `` . from the whole
i mean , that 's from my project , ``
and that also the one that 's going be with i have 's going a little data on i 'm going to tell you about little <unk> of i ? .
and i suppose that the most of them are <unk> , it would be an
i do n't do n't .
but maybe you be able to make it to love to real , that is to love that
my name is thomas <unk> , i am
i am <unk> is
and working in to
we 're working in the garden in agriculture of agriculture and in the way of agriculture of agriculture in the garden .
and
our <unk> motor is more a <unk> , a silence , a wonderful back .
and they new . of the beautiful in the did and .
it 's almost an
and not free , the old greeks of the relationship him
and in a wonderful verse of <unk> a
but the <unk> do n't go out and they west get their blue bees and the
a beautiful picture .
hopefully i look '' in my ultimately in where it was and
yeah .
this this is going to come on . and that so
i come to the project
one of those
in the
one
the teacher their side to know , and 's what 's going to be in the class and we 're looking at a <unk> brain .
most of the window with the window with the kids be able to see something like this month .
and all of these well , the bees and the argue of the bees and they people can go out and again and again .
and then the window will created a symbol that 's going with and then . and then
so .
and then the whole thing is going i starts to do on the <unk> .
so i take a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of it now , of i 'm up in a <unk>
so important to they '' on for they 're <unk> , was bees .
also , we also have a around <unk> . that has i have to be able i have to be a
and then one
there 's the honey . .
you need to have to do that : if for bad weather , and they ca n't fly .
so .
so that so this is what we see .
and then the <unk> here comes over here and immediately starts to do a lot of the other middle of the places of the world , by the <unk> place in the working .
and now , something gave a wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees in to the wall , suddenly to experience a break .
your people are people not .
they are
they do n't find their queen .
and that 's the most important task of the <unk> the way he does what very <unk> they 're going to do is that the queen is going to be in the old people .
so that 's not going to be about he <unk> on just he 's <unk> of these
and they 're sad the bees
they start to <unk> .
yes the
you hear that .
they 're almost higher thing as like they successful is in really <unk> about a queen .
and now , if this is a <unk> in to as go .
ladies and gentlemen , in one night , you '' now the need a new people , and this is up with a lot in the time the whole thing the whole thing , and that so enough enough , without understanding , getting a seems a relationship coming here that
here 's the people , that so the like this they '' you see the first night here .
because without the queen would n't exist for six weeks .
because of still six weeks .
so .
and in this first night , you get a pen these
and there are
everybody who see from this
yeah , there was
that 's true .
and now , something gave a wonderful .
and in ca there , which they 're going we have to be
it 'm going to have the first three days of the first the use of the same genetic code like the <unk> .
and then it 's going to be <unk> from i
you know that term .
and immediately , on this
the <unk> are going to change you can find in i
we 've been heard in to what was what we eat , which is what 's going to be . .
and at the queen is really wonderful to experience .
so three days of
and that can be the poor students . .
you see in the class and you their own and see . .
and then these cell are
no , that 's happening .
ladies and gentlemen , this this is an
and then , the poor students know , three learn of my students know , three five five minutes , so i way to make a queen <unk> days of a x-ray .
and at the day , if you want a teacher , a teacher some <unk>
and then the mother says , what 's what so ?
yeah , i need a working . .
yeah , why ?
yeah , our queen is . .
yeah ?
and then the morning are about process of six in school .
and then the <unk> of get get your
and if you can see in the really hard experience to you . .
these queen
so .
one little women .
and then the <unk> and open the queen .

the end of a thing that 's a even poem of
who would be the developing sun by a
thank you .

first of the <unk> .
my name 's
i 've right an <unk> years of a . and i did all . .
you can think of the job that the became not a
i did n't make know . .
and that 's why i was happy that i could be
for example . .
with a massive
in to to be i called it with a <unk> in a
that was a journey things i -- i was which
yet , these are like he had to find to find the interest in the media and even a little person like i could get say a difference is to the has . .
<unk> the
in the where we had to <unk> a nothing in a
and despite all of to all of them to do was in a different side of the other side of the <unk> , the
and twice , we 've been raised you and our two <unk> that you see here , with their bodies as a living of
if you want to kill your own of actually through us .
and i found a lot that i found in no want to be a down needs .
and then in young way , in young years , that is that is that you do n't reduce islam in ignore terrorism .
but christians n't want to be able to be able a terrorism .
the
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather than the real values , now the social responsibility . .
these are the values to physics .
for lot years , i 've been in this <unk> time to
and there are , then we heard of this
and then when we heard about <unk> 'd been
and the idea was born in the most that of deliver islam i have to make the need a lot in to the <unk> .
we were working with the <unk> that 's been in 400 artist organizations to have that .
and then we had to look at the way we 're going to be able a little
you would be able it to be <unk> of it and <unk> that
on
and were by
and to have these fight in all , was we incredible .
this this is a lack of the way of the way of it of the did and that -- .
and therefore , <unk> of and we went over that worldwide to first camera 'm here about to ? .
the bad <unk> hundreds in that so i do n't show you , but i want to go to the crime .
girl by always four weeks , to the sciences , on the middle you 're going to get on the earth of the earth and
what 's going to be is we have it by it , 's if this is a <unk> that was a
now , you take a <unk> . .
if you get your rule , you get two weeks .
in thank is <unk> in bodies of bodies that would be <unk> .
this are the ocean of to
in the <unk> , we 're going to go and go .
the man has to open .
he never saw a <unk> woman .
the <unk>
you 're going to get your penis with <unk> , of course the ones is , you know the way . .
and if you do n't change it the way the way this this is not bad .
then you 're up with
that so
there are a third of the girl .
these who had two turns how to be three months ago
office invited i lost the girl .
these are the <unk> , some in asia .
most of these -- only is
and when we asked muslims , why did you do that ?
was the <unk> answer , that 's what 's going to do , in the koran .
nothing about to the koran , the principle .
every few ways that we have <unk> in it in to the 1970s , as :
but they do n't seem to believe what they 're like it and . .
they 're going i got
but now we had the images that
he 's
there were hard problems to be a lot of time .
but we had the <unk> on our side , the most
and then the great decision , the needs this this is against all the human rights , against religion , we need to do it .
as a final did the way , the did have been published what new
and if you know africa and the <unk> knows , is just in to know that 's up have to do you . and you think of very if these one people .
and it was inspired you that have been <unk> of these raises , and then 's new countries .
quick example , <unk> , there was
and we then were able to get a little used to do about their own .
a hundred <unk> , we had this .
and where we came , we have open cloud , open poor of to the minds to to be holy synthesis in the other that .
and when we wanted to leave the country to look 're going i said , the great photographers and <unk> <unk> , you know , you know the whole
so much of life will be able to be able a lot of them .
he 's right .
i 'm
and i had a idea .
he said , if you can world a 10
and
and at to
he heard the idea of was thrilled , especially when we put it to him .
and that 's what we 're going to do about <unk> . that 's what we ? .
and then he said , i 'm not going to do to the feed the conference as we asked him , but i 'm up to take the <unk> .
and that 's what he did .
over asia to be
international <unk> <unk> on it by the female body of the female body .
in to
and all of know they 're coming and all and . .
a hundred <unk> , but the highest world .
the
so men can decide the lives and death .
but also the want . .
on to the left side that
the highest world .
i 'm going a lot of them i way to ?
and then i have ``
it started the conference .
and under the
<unk>
so much for the theme that islam is not <unk> .
we also had mobile wrote to the other way of the other way , what they ?
then
reality .
the music see , the men had more challenge .
they went back to
the <unk> goes on to the cameras ago a cameras the movements that this decided i decided .
and the most important sentence that are that .
female <unk> is an
he 's
we thought the job is done , but it are not wanted to do the bill enough enough .
because the galleries is a <unk> in to tell the woman is title two than anybody else .
that 's why we 're
we have this decades in in in in they called a houses .
one
and because margaret of
it 's up to the hands .
we were in need in around many countries , with to the primary <unk> .
and they started a lot of interest in a self to be so excited that they have
unfortunately , only most of the courage to be the courage to sleep that new of the <unk> that new and <unk> that
over to the audio that , this is not going to talk about the mismatch .
just have a couple in the courage . .
they went in the universities . .
and sometimes we found a between a cost is actually found in it in to the mismatch of the mosque . .
and then it goes out kind of over time you 're going to go even in to the
and these are the people .
that will faster .
but i 'm going to get to the things .
it 's all of we '' with brains the <unk> the way i work with many other strategies , this reward of
the need <unk> that .
but my favorite thing that would as this this is .
i want to have a called great message of the highest <unk> of the world on it on a
not in to the <unk>
if four million people come together , men and women are <unk> the topic that you see .
and 've got
and as it 's going we 've right now in to the <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> that
sadly the started to me , the again , in the last
but i 'm control when or he would like that .
to help these women .
for want to show the world to show that the true values of islam are instead that we 're going to be start . that 's going to be able to go . and it --
terrorists . and the <unk> and <unk> .
if i do n't do in to do you know a lot that i could ? 's with what 's more happening they had .
at terms of a 'll a through the world you '' in the head in the world of the same . .
and we could <unk> because 's what are going a little women . .
and maybe i do all in the time this little girl did there , the little girl has n't to as a daughters .
and then my life has been like this .
and i want to do with whether we actually what 's going to be guy or saw to help and . .
not in to be a <unk> and the
we need to go to i have a lot in the ministry is , we ? and i ?
and now i want to look at the design of my favorites of my own
this is my favorite <unk> to my <unk> and my
and this is in all the <unk> , in to the top of the arabic , in a name ,
and there are the bottom of the bottom and then . .
female <unk> is with the koran and the ethic of islam does of economics .
she so
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm going to go to . .
so the <unk> looked like that you got to have in germany .
in a
it 's a
my mother was totally libertarian out because for it to do n't understand why we have to free . .
we were news with it . and we were finally .
we were able to get the stuff , and then the stuff was going i had a
they tried to explain us to extraordinary . .
this is not sweet that 's people of . . . .
it even tastes very good .
it 's cheese .
my mother moved up and we were laughing .

in my hands to my own the will , we do n't have a
i 'm
i years next years ago , i am with my mother and my brother to china after cheap .
i way we made they human . and it 's what i do today of .
but what 's on to do is that the if you have to have the people who have evolved and made a success story .
but first of what 's what it 's what i 'm going to do .
i 'm
and
and this region is called the chinese global area in the walk .
it 's about <unk> kilometers of germany .
in china , in china , 10 million <unk> to <unk> is the biggest
and this
hundreds of chinese chinese were going to be able a lot a
our own installation , <unk> was designed these <unk> . and the face are affected that .
in schools and in universities , only chinese . that so far in the universities .
and our religion do n't be able i can if so we ? .
and to the
and if someone else they are and for the right of the <unk> of to the <unk> of
and that -- that are the reason , why he decided a parent decided a lot of us i 've said a around with kids of children .
that are
the picture this is just a fear of our papers in front that .
we did n't have enough money , so i had to do from these dad it who had a father .
i 'm going to have a through a lot of people who helped us in the table and . that 's what we have a around that of us that .
i 'm going to <unk> think that i 'm going a lot of pictures .
but we
i 'm going to call looking at the way to know , because 's my eyes .
he was large
the first one of it was discovered .
i know many of it is i have i want to have a huge picture of <unk> that the only business wants i no way we want to do is not going a lot of them .
but i 'm going to say , `` i call
because <unk> has been able a lot you . .
he was at
<unk> is in
you do there . .
we 're out there of them that .
because i had a catch in from my hand , and there was my photograph in my sure , ?
i had to be a <unk> and
and i 'm going to <unk> myself a
silence .
eduardo . .
a long time .
we were finally <unk> .
in the
i 'm going to <unk> young men who has used to <unk> is in the <unk> .
in an
at least kids children .
an
there were strangers faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to share a <unk> .
there was killed , jay you were done that and homework .
friends did n't have to visit to them up because i was <unk> . .
just my favorite of a <unk> of the <unk> in a
they knew my story and <unk> them very , and they were looking ''
for example , they team a
but they also helped me to be able i had a lot of <unk>
i spent my whole fascination in the <unk> .
that was not just for from my mother .
every day , with actually their times , and always in the uncertainty of uncertainty how we had a <unk> of it and could be able to be a
i 'm going to be
and it 's also very mines to tell you all right now , but now it 's just to be a part of my story .
i was very difficult , in my using my school the time a lot in school .
and the brought time to <unk>
so the normal of from my hand , i had to live in the
i 'm going a lot of <unk> a
just that are going to be a little bit of it that 's going a little bit .
and it 's also
or the have or just
we always have a lot of it that . .
i know going on going we were just now , in the fence , of course , and i 've said the way , going to be a
after two years , finally , my father came to germany .
but the problem was , that just these
i 'm going to <unk> them a by very , by the me , very close i 've trying a parent a father in
i 'm going to come it a lot of time where so i really was very happy , very happy , because after six years of
we got a <unk> for three years and we finally had a own apartment with a own doctor in a own kitchen and a own kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was very small , and i had no desk in , do it , i could be good a door .
and i 'm going to go it to me , and we have the where i had , very good , but i had to leave the <unk> .
i did n't see what it really was .
there was i a lot you 've right in the <unk> , of the <unk> to the
first of the <unk> . and then the
i 'm going a lot that i thought , that i was n't or not or really the where i was going a little used a little data .
and then i came to the <unk> .
and before i came a <unk> the did with my best friend of
and
but i was n't different
we had an
and the orchestra of
and then i came to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people without a screen , the possibility in the way . that 's a lot you . of the way .
and that really did them very good , and i 've been able a lot of , decided that is than a little bit of the
by
he made the movie <unk> of these friends of my friends and me .
and the movie won many prices and the serious of them .
we realized that people were lost for our story .
he was a very specific feeling , out because we never had that if we had to do you know the if you have to do that .
and that was a moment where i thought , ok .
i do n't want to get which . and i do n't want to do it .
i want to do something from my life .
an
but i was up in the <unk> building in a
so i was exactly right .
i played with .
and the great thing is that after a device , little
and i asked myself whether it would or just something now .
i thought i again the called
thank this .
and i made a
and i actually won it . .
now , now it 's going it to as a <unk> and serious
and that 's not group for them , now , if you do all have i time very much me or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> for me .
they did n't have to me the spaces of me , and they have talks to me , like 's going a way that it can as a place in society and
and so i come to you . .
every one of them has to get the ability a chance i have to get to help and find their lives or their place in society .
because , the one of the one , we have a lot of a hundred pounds that we '' and every one of them are full of hope and every one of them have a big potential .
they have a around a lot of determination to make a lot of things students .
and with this determination , they could really be a human system have to be a human system in construction and every matter of us .
and i could actually tell you a page of what you can do , but i do n't even have enough where there so , i years a fight , it 's going a little data .
now the mobile die an mobile phone is not going a way we can tell me that they can not be able to be able to do it . .

this is a little advertising i wrote .
feet .
rich of vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin lugo
very funny .
i want to write a joke about the <unk> of your friend , but it are just flat .
yeah , it 's not about just from these
and
yeah .
thank you very much .
you were called a idea .
thank you , season and gentlemen .
let me start with an
why do you want a lot that you do n't ? .
i think every if this for the food this is going a question is , whether he can look `` close i be able to see what it as you as .
the answer is very clear .
we know that the life expectancy of the birth of birth is only about <unk> 'd like
this they have to have a
why do we do it yet all ?
why are we going to be interested is <unk> laugh from the <unk> of the <unk> of to the part of each other ?
you 've been looking at at all years together , and have look at the <unk> .
it was fat .
you thought if you 're up fat from food , we 're going a lot that we '' and will be healthy old .
what 's up to
then you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the <unk> and it so .
and then , on
so it 's going to get i up to the
how ? .
now , the reason is , for my promise is the off in least
<unk> too
the <unk> , is `` you would know .
and
the <unk>
keith <unk> -- seven years in to the place .
then the newspaper died .
or this lady here .
marco
the oldest person who had lived with the earth .
the
i know there are different one of them , is , what they 're hearing for , do n't find their
and
and she heard with and
it so <unk> the
what does that tell us ?
not that cigarettes are healthy .
but it says that it was very complicated , of course , we need to take i need to take a little data of statistics the way are we need to ask the pretty pretty simple systems and we need to ask .
and the pretty pretty simple question , of course the simple question in many okay , the women but women -- women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it .
so this this this is the <unk> in to the <unk> of to the
and there are a pretty pretty simple proof that men are most able i 'll be as old as used as women .
now , everybody can think of yourself , whether it so a
austria is a <unk> country .
but it 's going a little data , no fear .
we 're course we need it to be course with <unk> with
sounds complicated , but just to be course of
so , in thank is someone in it
ah .
they '' a day 10 mandela 's made and <unk> in a talk and <unk> in a talk .
this this this is the secret of your name , right ?
we n't on the 10 cigarettes to do there .
but for you what they would have <unk> and they had been terrible , coming to to as the everything else . .
even hard statistics are n't space and
now , for may , for example , the example you who area in to do is that people who -- the
so , so to be able i 'm going to go that
is <unk> and the
is that at a
no .
it 's about that one people just have enough money in the pocket of the pocket . .
but if i have a group of <unk> a
and actually , these are made trying to be able to do that that .
you have to say that a
and that works for the different organisms .
for bacteria .
you see the <unk> . .
if we look `` the <unk> species , then for to see it , it turns going to be the audience of the way of the way in the <unk> line .
the same is true for
it 's not about being thin .
it works in
and this is another experiment , which was done in the united states .
what did you have ? .
you have
and who are , of story , the <unk> are beliefs , sick and have been <unk> <unk> the happens and almost
now , you 've right : now , you know to
the day in a day , they 're not up i do at the day the day have been twice as his own .
and these
even early
both have a lot of them .
it 's a sick and the other healthy .
what 's going to within ?
it 's going to be a process called a
when they 're using emotional organisms or market cells , to take food
it makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see how in the cell is
the
and they from the old
that so this is really to <unk> to the
so , to get to some
and it 's probably going i think this this is also working in if if people works .
and we learn that they 're not like in <unk> , every small
no .
but , you 're supposed i want i what this is , ah , oh , maybe the <unk> <unk> .
they '' their evil like a friend .
and that makes sense of meaning .
and seen measure nine nine nine percent of the history , to the human history of on what he had to hunger ?
exactly , he went on .
we 're going to go down i ? and if are hunger of hunger .
and that 's safe against biology .
now , of course , we know , of course , in the bible , <unk>
this this is going we can look `` very use .
here 's the
the three <unk> here is good , the food on to the day , but much .
and this this this is a very and and . that so . that 's the way and the
so we 've got to look at the search in the
that could be interesting to people who do n't have a
and it might be able to be start by the world was
so the question is , we can see a
and we have many hundred , the page of the thousand times to the thousand and seeing entire family in i and . and that -- .
we 've most question that is called the
and
in the skin is we
and
and if we 're going a lot of cells in human cells , for example , you see this and what was happening that . and you who look ''
this is the <unk> questions here .
is the <unk> , and are 's going i 'll own <unk> of the <unk> of he the
and
and that works in different organisms .
so here are talks can show you in a <unk> .
so we 've most question that a <unk>
life because emotional organisms .
and the answer is , you see , is the basis of a
it 's simple <unk> and it so .
after a soil business days , all dead days , after 4,000 days , is be can about half . and the 20 business days is about half .
when we go i put years in water the water the animals will people are terrible the animals and survive .
we also know that human cells that we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in needs to be about day for three times as long as we percent . .
and the latest friends also have much more likely it to be used think that work this is up by the children that will as a
and is not just the life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice -- these pieces ? .
so .
and now the of start , of course , you want to know , will be
as the name is , we 've been born in the sperm , there so it dollars it in very high school .
but i can make think you 're up in the
then we said , because
and you have to know that the common denominator of all the
and we have wanted to ?
they 're going to be able a lot of them . .
and these do n't get them , in fact , if you 're going to be old .
they 're going a more
and the molecular mechanisms that -- they from schools are also materials :
now , now , how i would home now , up how to the devil is the wrong memory in fruit at the time n't ?
this is the experiment what we 've trying to have in green samples is after top that we want it . and they want i 've wanted to do it .
they take a hundred amounts that you have here that this is a power that is going i love .
<unk> .
and let 's look `` <unk> that <unk> .
then take to fly the same way , own to the next player and give you the other words you water , were <unk> and the
we 're going to take know a lot in the <unk> that on the way they 're going to be
they from
and 've got the same fly again to do that . and then you 're more doing this and . .
the speed is down to it you been down in the <unk> , there are the way in the <unk> of the way of the way and see it of .
and if you 're going down here , you 'll give you the both side of the side of the side side of the other both side of the other side .
where do all go ?
clear .
<unk> and the
except the two .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say the record .
i love my favorite and so i do n't want to do it let me go come let me go through so much more . .
okay .
but is the by a lot in the way that the makes the line of old . and
not only with democracy .
and we could actually fly the <unk> of the fly in
and the <unk> that your question were made , again the way .
that means , ``
and that 's important , because we do n't want to have the <unk> of to the kinds you have to what -- .
it does n't make sense of the time of the <unk> .
and i do n't want to do it , enough to give you a couple that we have a couple in terms in which 's going a lot that we need it . .
even more
it 's not about the interest , or so .
there are in the way , you 're going to take i think of the
this is the sort in
and that so a know . and that so . that 's very ;
that means it is
avoid <unk> .
it 's not going a lot of complex complex the way , not a communicate .
it 's really about candy .
you know that <unk> are used a lot of diabetes , to be traditions , even if they 're <unk> and they ''
and you also know that sugar can accelerate the questions of tumors and the taken .
you see , for example , you see the <unk> <unk> in figure how to be . and . .
after 30 days , the impact are dead .
very small <unk> from the extra bunch of wealth of the way and the
to produce 's
there 's just a example , that works in almost all organisms .
eat vegetables and vegetables
avoid the gift of a lot of <unk> or <unk> .
you know that <unk> , and
this this is people not under conditions for vitamin d
we 're going we have a lot of degrees in the winter of a <unk> to the winter because vitamin convince are using i used a lot that 's going with to the skin .
some of the three times a week , a death later a week , this this this is not here in . of the way of it and .
ng the
do you look '' in the time of the <unk> , the beautiful and <unk> in to and . .
the impact of pray and blood pressure on the life is coming which is left that . and
because of course the life is states like women .
<unk> and
<unk> life more little than a
but <unk> lives still as a <unk> of life .
just
what is that ?
people think in terms that 's with i 'm here be able we have to do with a
except it to be , in should the pretty pretty simple .
now , if you 're a
and what 's going to happen in their
and
so that 's why it has been able to be course of the way that we have to do it you what 's going to do and
a slow situations or the ideas of the ideas this is like with condom .
they should not live in a much
now you think of the same thing .
but that 's not to ? . .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure the evolved of it in i a much
and that so when he says , i used to be used to it .
i can sleep and the noise does n't make me nothing and . that 's if for me and you all ? .
is people not .
he still have <unk> in blood and that 's bad .
and it own time the way you its own . .
we know that <unk> is very good news effects .
all that is going i can increase the <unk> that . of it that
and we also know that six of and <unk> <unk>
and that are the way , the way because is because when we had because that 's the way that we what we have to do with the
not without sense .
several studies of the pattern of the dark selling
just recently , a nice 100 100 study that has talks about in ca there 's i about i have : a talk to the size of a day , a talk to to make it <unk> on the rather
so what they do they do is that is that this is the <unk> you see really to to the picture you --
there are studies that show that , there are studies that do n't show that .
what 's clear this is that coffee works against diabetes , and so they something now like get rid that are improved one in the way that for diabetes .
and coffee is also a good <unk> the way , because he 's up with the way was like we be story in
and so , know a very beautiful and <unk> wonderful 100 years in a thousand years of years , have talks that people who are going i have to eat every day , the talk i have
this is a huge value for the <unk> 100 trial .
and this is true to
but people who are not going to be able a <unk> . and they '' .
the give they go to the other way to call me , ok ?
but that 's actually true .
so , have not true .
the next point is a little bit of the
avoid a lot of the <unk> scales i 've work on meat in meat that are
so the by very beautiful new study shows that if you 're going to take into what
it 's people for will not as a around to to as a lot of proteins , of course , and it 's not not for
they were start using
and what they do is , you know to do , you know , you think of to get it , you had the figure out that so the
all
this is the gentleman
he comes from my home of
and it 's very good .
he 's not an
he did can have can come it to to get to to the <unk> that it i also said .
we should not be able to do the
which this is the <unk> that i did there are one of a <unk> to be a <unk> , but 've been a
you can something our makes a lot of people to be happened , of a
and
the brothers are
a work in the top you have <unk> the imaging
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm going to do .
one question the question is , because it 's a thing , going to be a little bit of the one is a little bit of them ? .
the
more little than i thought .
but it 's probably going i 've right now , why for you what for you n't on , the people who have right now is actually of a
many people do there are
it 's not the case . .
in ca there are actually a phenomenon of a phenomenon of people than alone .
maybe it 's because what they other they other this is , how the love is discovered .
does you sort of feel yellow or is you <unk> n't ?
you can feel smart , without
and you can be able to feel like in it , and you not feel like that and they from the moment .
canada also has a lot to ?
and that 's also going a few days our own . that 's going to be able a <unk> of it .
canada leads to <unk> that dollars you can go you . of it was going it .
db needs time .
so that -- there 's no one that will what i what it has a few seconds that it 's going to have . .
db needs
db needs the time to be aware of their own .
and limor needs to make a work i be old i can after talk about it .
and this concerned we do n't have to do .
we do n't have the language of the language , we have the signs of ourselves to who are , because we 're <unk> all ?
there 's little
the one off of humanity says , you know the beginning of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and . .
the birth to death is actually or
there are a few moments of life where you can be
so these one people are often going to go to the
i did n't have time to not
and then there are people like a lot of them , who most say a lot of stuff this is connected .
and i do n't have it the , are just a part of the big universe .
and there are the big group of the time it 's the where it 's like that . of the time .
now , to would think , okay , today i am a
if we think about sars , we 're always going a lot of the big variations about was it i had i think is a lot that . that 's a big bang of the way of the way that we do of we what --
the purchaser you have
but about he
i do n't want to talk about <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> and and
alec in want to be able to be able to be able to be able a lot that we 're going i 'm going to have a lot of it i other . that 's going to be able to be
the <unk> . this they did a few pictures that i want to show you .
how easy to as it this they 're up to the no longer in the want .
we do n't know , if he other people have look at to be <unk> they actually have right in this moment .
but who knows it , the moment of how we think of this for the way is , you know , you know , you know , you know the self is lost in the corner and did there .
and these suddenly , these suddenly
maybe some of them have been done . .
what this is going to do is , this is going to do the yeah , and you know the cell phone , and in ca there , in ca all the <unk> to see to the
so clearly to see what they look at . .
what we do is not doing here .
yeah , and then there 's to hide i way to do to you , in it , in it to be
these are the <unk> that you see from the outside .
we have i mean no people .
but i 'm sure there are people in the room that have been able i feel like the whole whole take long understand , by trying we tried to have he technologies to as 's going it . and you think of it .
and there are also in this bad hand , which do n't what they '' is , because they have to give you a different one people , we have to have we with the death or because in a strong did that .
and there are nothing that there are was so need to be so many people , also people who are connected to them around them . .
and there are people who have based on yourself , and on ourselves i have no equivalent i have a lot is to get here , that 's why they 're <unk> that . .
i 'm going to get the digital variations .
and <unk> . you 're going i 'm going to leave to hide it . .
the new gore this is familiar .
these are people who think of their opinion to social contacts and <unk> that
and it are space . .
there are no number that some of the number of , because someone else some people have to do when not and not .
and then it camp down a old one .
it 's the new shape of loneliness and the
but since we live in high working with lot of people with a lot of people with facebook or facebook or core , or bought this digital digital nervous in to as much and larger .
you can be connected to hundreds of people without a single people . .
it 's because you '' you 're using to the heart of the <unk> of human relationships , it so missing this this is in digital relationships the quality of the relationships .
the two forms of sars things ?
and that are new , i 'm going a little bit of a little bit of <unk> and
whereas the situation , a lot is done for
it 's going to be able to make to get a digital variations you 're up in the future , if the opportunities is up a lot . that 's going to be bigger and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of .
i do n't know if you were going it to be a sense of the <unk> is very similar to the <unk> that things will be done . and it 's going to be able a little used . .
or whether you find a new term .
but these are also the happen in to the world of to the world .
almost larger two two two times the literally fear and these literally fear that do n't have to do to ?
and
in which what they say for people are all to ?
they build <unk> , they were
but the <unk> , what what they did n't have a fear in the villagers you have a lot that they '' this they 're going a lot of . .
<unk> go .
things <unk> in .
both of the process of the process of the consequence is because it 's at least a contact be in it if the vision piece that you have .
the show is just very north , and it 's going to be very quickly , of this <unk> . and it 's going to do so .
so we need to buy new things in the where we have
i 've seen the advertising for a <unk> little used that . and i 've seen a little used . .
and the <unk> <unk>
what 's up to ?
there are history of doing we what 's going with there this is going i 'm up with the way of people . .
and
hand on the heart , who knows that ?
and in it , in i think of the other seems to the <unk> me , of course , and suddenly , to whole matter you 're going a lot to too feel terrible <unk> and ask the question , who is that person ?
did i do something to do something ?
a study says in the <unk> women around to the outside to <unk> i do a lot of kids , feeling of times .
criminals are missing because i do n't know what so i 've right to ?
but it so also not days because it 's most importantly the studies of studies , of the use is that people are
that 's the way is that to be the way in the way to be a <unk> in the way .
under
talk about it not a thing can talk about it with successful .
and that was probably going a lot is . of everybody .
even while you 're going to get
who is that person in my bed ?
and the becomes i ? to there but not voices to do what has to do with the quality of the <unk> .
nothing to do with the quality of relationship .
it 's always space . .
we 're not comes to you , because we do n't look at it .
we do there are people not talking about them in the workforce .
in the world , i think it they from to be <unk> two times than 's going i think .
i stood which <unk>
the two men have done the two women in the moon on to have i what so . .
and in him , in between to a <unk> the <unk> , a
i think i do n't have to do the scene of the scene that you have to do this shape of sars i us in say , you be start in his own lives in his own . that 's been able a little place .
it 's the parable you know of the
but it 's also the dilemma in the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i who see here , you never see the work on
in the
where they are , where you '' and you '' . .
and that are a answer of loneliness the way that 's not talking about .
so it so is also the
it was a bit that you 're going with and . that 's what so .
i told me an
an
so it has to as a <unk> . and it 's a
and two months later , he is
so , it never come you talked about .
they 're always going to do with other feelings .
she has beautiful siblings and she has 10,000 salmon and they have a lot . .
the ugly siblings that was all that we know .
fear , ``
but we should not forget the beautiful siblings .
the freedom of the freedom of the pleasure that
so my tongue also look at the variations . .
comes and go is in take in why .
let 's go to and her . that 's not going to go .
because there are something say much more two little than the sars you and this is the empty , which may be on i or if they do there . .
canada is part of life .
since i 've said , so it are just look now can then black .
for it the . we do at terms you 're not now like an
i 've been able to have been done car , i 've right ? and it 's right you world they my life . that 's going a way i 'm going to go .
so it was like the <unk> in here they there .
and there so i was going we got . of the way of it that i years .
people come and go to go to <unk> is one more immediately to <unk> africa or i where you will be we see i had it a lot in a group in a business in a business of it .
and as a child , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing .
you be able to have a conversation without someone with public . and a seconds .
whether you have in the economy or in the economy
every time it led a <unk> and <unk> and
as a single child , i found the question that i look 're embarrassing .
and as wrong , it 's a incredible company that it 's going i have a incredible thing a consequence in this escape and to there of this demonstrate . .
but just since i 've right now to what i years about it , you be able to go back a little used to me and open up . that 's the want to go .
you see the
thank you .
yeah , thank you .
i have three of think that i 'm going to do .
one
and now , i 'm going to do you if you just take i think that you would take out in the way that you would take ?
most of the people had to decide for the <unk> and the <unk> .
and this this this this is a great different thank you .
and why ?
because we 're going to make to be to the biggest effect of the biggest effect .
we do n't make it kind that way . .
and there do we about to the biggest effect on the university that are ted , except for other strategies .
we decide to
big <unk> that do n't make a lot . .
so that 's why i do n't think of so dropped . .
or we decide to the
it 's for diet .
but also by the very big bang , but still very big effort in . and it so . and
and was not was so darwin .
and i want to tell you today about to do about the largest
if you go a little bit of identity in terms of health and health , you 're if they 're people to world .
and the theme is called ray that this this is . .
and the theme of modern bit do at germany was n't a theme of the <unk> things .
and then the number of the rest you were in cheap .
and i asked me , what was in to the
why did it not come going we come here ? .
and then i was going we got to go in in the time that i 've been <unk> that .
because it was exactly in to the way .
what was there ?
there are
and we 're always going to grow you n't . .
and i went on that .
<unk> comes to germany . .
and the orchestra experiment problems of .
and in the years , the curve is still going to go with . .
and what 's going to then ? .
and
and we 're always going to grow you n't . .
well , i got if you have if you have it and one .
because it was clear .
sports does dick .
and obviously
because that 's not true .
but one of us have right an area and then in common .
the taliban -- i did n't have a new
so what is it ?
the diet ?
and there are the big 100 study of the states .
and to have a problem about the problem can as been <unk> in the problem .
and they 've got a
and then you want to look at what almost told n't ? .
and they saw , one of the one people -- they 're always going to take less fat on but they 're space , ?
and that was paradox .
and therefore they whole . . .
we can explain that ?
and there -- you 're which you be able to imagine the body like i think that .
there 's to not the big
and on one side of a side comes up the <unk> i do , so we 're going to do the entire
and here is the energy of the energy than electricity and the play .
but if we 're going to look '' you '' in our power here in when we use the other side of the side in to to do i ? . .
the human body does n't make the same .
the energy can be able i can make 's light that . and it can be . of the light .
it 's in the shape of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
but what happens when we have a lot of how we heard of , energy and yet <unk> , and then the energy is going to go to to be a end and then and then . .
the <unk> has grown years and <unk> that
there 's no life in all and it --
we 're only kind of it of it that . .
and that 's what happens .
our grandparents are also
and we 're going to have a between little kilometers , and these -- these -- these -- are the positive ones .
there are studies who -- they these but
i 'm going to give they a little bit of the
give me a degree of the chair ?
mike , you know a degree ?
mike is americans .
he 's <unk> , he 's not going to talk a around .
and he was in this study in this study and here this this is now .
he 's this typical <unk> ,
and mike are always going a lot of and happened , in fact , and yet it 's space and always going it .
why ?
because mike is still yet .
and i 've been came over how much movement is so on a day , and he was our
and there was a thousand steps .
this was so the distance to come up about
and he came to a thousand steps .
that means mike are 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and <unk> under created
under these conditions , disease is disease of alone .
and mike is not so beliefs up out out because it so long the happened to the top of the energy , and we ?
and first of the energy , the energy of how you see here is on say . .
but energy is <unk> , which is not there .
and to look `` look `` died in
and there 's what on the way , of start about it you of and
so that
so if the energy <unk> into blood , then the doctors are talking can <unk> in the water in the died of high live of high using 20 five times .
and that
and a happiness the children are going it to take at it of the whole <unk> of these little wounds and we talk about the
and now , the heart 's powerful right now hear under engineering , because now he has to make the blood through these little
and if in to the heart of the
and when the heart happens , we call the heart disease .
and if in the head , we call the stroke and then .
and in germany , every second thing in germany , every means of heart disease and stroke .
that means in germany , every second thing in cheap . .
and also , mike is not so identify because he does n't make a 75 sports , but because he does n't get more . of all .
and if you do n't know these run to n't see , you look `` the form . .
for example , for sort of diet of diet that . and you know to the theme in i . .
i 've most important a little bit of yesterday , and there are <unk> <unk> and
and if every book is just like this this , of course i would have a <unk> i had a few feet
and i read the time for you .
and there are all able to take it you : so they 're going to take more energy than they use think in the did and then they 're going to take them .
and if you why they 're which what for them , they 're going to do they my own in .
this is brilliant and the
but why do we need to get
it 's just going it to the end that . of course and it so
and the need of course , that 's huge , but
because why is i a ten percent ? . .
because it 's a diet , and not a lifestyle and it 's not it and . .
and on what we do is i ? with to get day , of start to does day , of five center , when 's five weeks , when we go to this fight , again , in to the normal want i go to the england . .
what 's time big by five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
but
so you can be system to be on through 'll every new diet , in any much much more <unk> the question the way to be able a lot of questions the way you make it in their lives you as well in their own .
yeah , right ?
and if yeah of the did and then .
and if no let we stay . .
because if you 're not going to go , so it so <unk> for to the end . . .
it 's the habits of the habits of whether 's what 's going a lot is to be sick or healthy .
it 's the bad habits that make actually sick .
and it 's the good habits that make us healthy .
and if mike look at the mirror , it looks like the result of his daily lives .
if mike look in to to the mirror , it looks like his daily habits .
and if mike looks in a mirror , of course the way , it 's also what 's up in the mirror .
because if he has here more bad habits as good , it 's going to be in the direction that 's difference in the did and . .
and if mike wants to be the ability i want to make health direction of their rock the feedback , he does all have i have i have to be start to be the whole life .
and then he just need to just need a every good habits not need a bad .
and an
mike has been able to get
and i 'm going to look 're <unk> be
so he goes into say in say , in its
and my grandfather had just now like this and the . and you know ,
that -- in ca n't know to ? . .
who would have said , sports is for one of people who do n't move .
and somehow he has right .
why do we have to look at the moment they 're going a lot of what we have on the covered is ? .
and we who have to have it a talk about they
but what -- this is a lot of easier a movement that we on , there but we have lost know of them .
in the daily lives of life and in a covered and
and therefore it so <unk> we 're going a way we 're going to do today .
maybe you know the situation , you 're going to look at the situation , and i years , and they '' in to the she , you know , in the first one of the first one is people of to as it and . .
and it looks : so this they 've also really learn going we see in to could . and it 's a lot is .
we always want to go to the trends of it of . .
we want to do when 's our apartments to have the <unk> way .
we want to make because we want it to have a children , but we do n't have to get the did is will one where we are
but in a very different direction .
so they be thanks a <unk> and
i love to be <unk> in to
and i 'm the only one , the only and down and down of the way the want to go and all no other .
but if i 've right now the time i 'm going to be
and then i 'm going to be a dead movement is going to be like that . .
and if is the <unk> the
so
that 's about three minutes
and an
it might not as a back . .
but as an
we do n't have in our bodies .
and you give me to them , i years , it always
the americans are crazy , the question of what 's going about .
this is an
are all not person . and i earth of always four pounds .
just as this is what happens to these little steps .
and if the effect is from this point to what for about with what 's going to happen when you really live this in i have we have you it is in it . .
and this
as is when they were course we 've look at
and if you think that and where you have time and 've got the end in 75 .
then you what on the <unk> that 's much here .
and then they 're going to be faster of them and stronger .
but they do n't get their single health . and they do all of sports of sports .
so they ? it 's one that they ? .
because the most important thing that you do is that they ? .
and i 'm going to take we
and for me , it 's more than a little women , for them , it 's an
because i think health has not to do what we should do or do .
but health has to do what we want .
and so i years , i 'm or just a idea for them .
decide what was just about to ? that 's all said . of the best .
and now , you think , you think , you would know how it goes .
step for step .
thank you .
<unk> how did it a leonardo of leonardo in to be so incredible , the other did the world with other eyes ?
and then even in i think can as i think that was going i 've also been going to have a every time , which was a lot of time ?
can are 's what we could do today n't ?
did in fact to do what with <unk> all ?
and how can we make it the chinese and make making out in our future ?
let 's start with the question of what we do in innovation ?
clear .
technology <unk> and development even the
so you know . .
it 's all great .
and we can be proud of that and grateful that we are
that we what we have to on this is an student , unique wealth .
but how do it look like the future ?
what challenges are because of moving ? .
and who cares in a change and social challenges ?
so <unk> does we clear to be able a kind that it seems to . .
a kind of <unk> and a way .
so the economy is about the world 's challenges out of the world because of entrepreneurs of a sudden so we get productivity of the water you grow more of the spaces in the world .
and the world 's going a better way to do that , and we what they n't want to have a year and <unk> that , of course , and they much have i have to do with to do i think of the <unk> in the world so , of course , and us
at least <unk> .
but who says that we have to look at the whole thing not also also look at ? .
how would we be course in when we get our <unk> social and cultural dimension ?
if technological ground is also the summer of the cultural innovation ?
if economic innovation are also social innovation ?
if we think that we my job would had to think of the solution of to the solution to to be a lot that we have to do with the solution and future challenges ?
and now , if it so much were going it to be unknown forces , and if it 's a very down other a different way a every want to do for the future that this have happened there ?
because how was we n't n't n't ?
both sides wanted to do , but there 's organized there ?
can that be ?
ask you to ? .
now the time 's what 's going to do this they 're design as i 'm going a contradiction .
fortunately , there 's no office .
whereas
and interestingly , as say , much more in the slow
and he got
and the deal of the opportunity is that 's going i 'm going to be known with health . .
and i come a lot of them the
<unk> <unk> wrong guy .
great trained to , n't even to have say , also to get got say ,
and yeah , yeah . .
i love a thing in . and i like it and like we like . .
and if you see the look a real thing , i who do there , we ? so we need to make our future .
yeah , right now the time he started a lot of time is up with it you start with a <unk>
it also !
and that 's just like looking at looking at him . .
and yet something this this is . .
so he does there 's not even more , that 's kind that in me ?
this this is how to to be to ? of course , he 's always saying of we in . .
these --
and that 's what it does of it of .
and it new
so the right now , the <unk> , which this is the use that he has the doing .
so not that he knows him personally , but the <unk> talking about it . .
and there are to to be to to the t in the age of three texts to to do it .
so the more , he was surprised when he was able to go over to the
and out that
and when
so that was the big joy , so with young people , there 's got its hard else .
and the two have found out of them .
and they always met .
how would we look : if so , you know , in one in this made of the two days there ?
yes
what is the difference between the
i do there are people not in it and that and . that 's what it was . .
yeah , so , then we start to been looking `` what is
so name is what 's going with of .
autonomous markets , <unk> products , <unk> customers , <unk> structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also give you hope where a big data is
and even more purpose the where it 's very <unk> this
what is actually we actually
so , <unk> , you 've got i 'm going to have a lot that it was not going a little bit of a big limited in a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different character .
because it has nothing <unk> and it has nothing .
no
so , by therefore , an
and you 're going to understand that , in idea , of course , there are different kinds that gives for the want to be different kinds of ways of want a different kinds that are different the make , very down , by want a different way and the other things
yeah , that 's exactly what i 'm doing that of . .
but what do 's going it ?
so , i 'm going to go to go to go it to go how a lot you go i 'm going to make a lot of the
so i 've got to say i years , so , was that
that means . .
how you have serious businesses and then
oh no .
real
what do you think that if is what you do with the beginning of the <unk> money , what is you going to have ? .
so , is is
what happens to your engagement , how do i know ?
and also , we look `` the
so the statistics about
money is always the result of a successful company and a good puzzle company of a called it and . that so
sure the money this is a <unk> for
and it 's the basis in the basis of economic growth .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yeah , what is the goal ?
the company ?
so , when 's on what i 've been doing this , was not a did . that 's not a did .
so , the brings , but always , always to not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able a lot . .
and if i do n't have this , so how ? 's how i do n't know what i 'm up to do ?
so that does n't make it different reality .
so how do i think in the way , and and risks and risks , it feels like all the <unk> and the
yes the
but i may as is with you .
one that relationship in .
so this is <unk> a
successful <unk> of developing developing generation .
one
so how do you say today ?
``
so we 're going a lot of the <unk> and <unk> of it .
in terms that rover you and
so hey to help and helps . .
i 'm going a lot you can go i . .
okay .
yeah , thank you , hey <unk> .
but there are just the question . .
can for is the use that you know to see one that important amount of <unk> qualities have good taken . .
can we go to if is the make one of the other to i do in the want that i could trying a little data ?
so the first is , on what is i here and what do it ?
yes the
what do you do on to the world ?
what do you have to do with you ?
what are you ready ?
what are your inner life i 'm going a lot of .
why is that important to see that ?
because these are the
and how did we have to study ? .
if you build a ship , not the men together the men and make 's a brains they '' and they my wife a lot of them , and they '' for to the amount is the development of the sea .
yeah , good .
so then it 's going to be <unk> a technology . . .
what is my favorite
what does that mean ?
yeah , now , you my interest now are going a goal .
<unk> <unk> they 're going i 'm up with you in it the same when you do there , you know the way this you do n't want to stay on .
do you have the story with the pink elephant ?
and then we 're up a degree of a did that
not ?
<unk> .
so , look at to .
you ? i way this is like they do at a electronics in the knew that is a electronics
okay ?
works ?
so no pink elephant .
understood ?
no pink elephant .
look at the way ?
so this have happened because we want i focus on what we do .
what is the only way ? .
there 's a lot in it there ?
yeah , yeah , look `` you know what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or perhaps
but finally to you .
by on the way , what do you do you know the way you ?
i 've got to ? and it 's a paper that i 'm doing and i am of . .
<unk> , if is to <unk> it .
``
who ?
in idea that
i was
i am
i 'm going a <unk> <unk>
and i 'm what
``
oh , <unk> <unk>
and
<unk> from
it 's the
the real <unk> of .
and <unk> how does it look like ?
is you what noticed ?
has changed something ? .
okay .
okay , and the flower also .
okay .
so , then we look `` look at will look at will . . .
and <unk> of . .
``
who ?
in idea that
i was
i am
i 'm going a <unk> <unk>
and i 'm what
``
and then
so , i know , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i saw the first time .
i thought it can people as well and i was n't .
and yet , a lot more recently was , i could go through the head to to the audience , it where it was the million where we go let it been ? and
through my life .
and okay , i understand that it 's completely national of it and . of it of it and . and
and to prevent the <unk>
but what 's going to do ? .
what was the and
and therefore , of system , you know the perception you can do n't see really the bomb , this they can be able a lot of the natural especially quality that are going it . and
good , yeah , thank you , we 're going to get to the next question .
how could i come to my goal ?
so , that 's what i think of good love .
and i 'm going i think that 's on a moment the way that so i ? .
yes the
that 's going to be easier when is what is what you might have to do . and
because if you see then you 're clear to your head the flow and if is what this allows they have it to be very much , so i promise you to do we 're going to happen in the way . .
almost automatically .
you 're not going to be able to do that one that is going i 'm going to do in this , in is that things are going to go to this .
and that -- these are the tree
and yet the question is the question , it 's going to look at you to look good to you , who could be able a lot that you could ask to ask , that they could get here a lot of things a lot of things to get more .
and you also have a big model .
the <unk> did you on the big
and
for lunch to the famous big table .
and it 's ted different like a every way that
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , venezuela , architects and he has <unk>
but not in our world today a lot of sense , where it was , yes the way there 's ? .
who has right ?
but even that all of these different things have right , well a lot you have to what 's not in the way of you can what alone are going i could have .
good , yeah , the next question is , on the technology , what 's the technology ?
<unk> , there are successful entrepreneurs in the reason .
instead of trying it , you know , and so , of system and so on the next step . .
because what 's going a way to do is ?
but these do that by to this know , with at all of to to the stranger .
and if it was nothing , dan look at all the other hand . .
and even if the big , <unk>
so this this this is so able to do your attention .
these -- there -- all that are the lower fish .
and in the way , how did we have all the way a lot is trying it ?
even though we did n't know , and it does `` no one n't said ?
now the idea for children is , you had a lot you to ?
so , this tendency i think that look `` the
and this this this is exactly what to do is to make a lot in the uncertainty you 're more three of where we ? .
yes the
so that 's going it to as well .
but i do n't know , in the company , i 'm up a lot of the <unk> a around that there was something happening and .
and the want i think in ends here in germany , there is that meaning in construction .
and i think of the politicians have to be able a lot of that it voice of .
okay , my boy , come back . .
how go being down down . .
what do you do the other if you can change ?
10 ?
fourth ? .
10 million ?
look down here .
who are you looking at n't ?
right , the way and that are . .
that 's the way this you can change that is what they really can change .
or to say it with mahatma gandhi a change that you can see you in the world . and you 're up in you .
think of patient words and big characters , but how should in to work ?
and there -- we have a lot of <unk> on when we were course the
let 's go to all sorts you know a little data very quickly the way is if is a little data or like this , and you have to do all with you .
and if you look at these thinks what you do when this is what you 're going to do now , here this posture you people be course a lot that you can be able to feel more . .
let are say what is what is going to you to do about you , you think about is going be
and the finally the end that you 're going i was in in for this region or what 's going to within .
so i 'm going to get from this , if is what we 've told you is at terms of the end in to you that . .
yeah .
thank they very much .
and do you really do in from my lab all the time at the time there ?
yeah .
and you think that 's all of this stuff .
first of the time , on to the clarity of your opened , then then to 've the <unk> what so much that is up and
because that 's going a perception . .
and the second amount you 're which is up it on your opened and the second one that you have i do that
because it 's what is what you 're going to do as is to look now like the other people .
and the enough is going to be going to change our own perception .
do you get to you ?
yeah , i think . .
thanks
all good <unk> <unk> .
yeah .
what do you think of our <unk> all ?
nice .
really , or
and how do we think of they now about in for this <unk> all ?
is that a new <unk> ? .
i mean , yeah .
very clear and clear .
i see the <unk> . .
``
and that 's what the <unk> really is .
one
and no , new <unk> , <unk> .
it was to
the moment in the big tree
robert <unk> about
let 's just make this mind . .
and who may be aware you will not think that of because in when the mean of the technology of our time .
you 're right the way i am
so maybe it was
instead of the way we 're more interested is the most of the time .
i 've got i have i have a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i was
we 're called
so why is i going to take it up we have a lot that have been able it to have the great mistake ? .
our program is often one of to done so easy to understand how programs are to children that do that .
and i said this is that the <unk> of the last place in the universe is that we would work .
what do you believe is the most important factor of the players with to the people who we work ? .
we found it , positive kinds in terms that are often important positive kinds in common in terms . .
and if you think about why it 's so many <unk> and so many <unk> , there so often this father this father does n't have a reasonable work that he gives subject i do subject or that or that just in prison
and then if you think of it to i think of i would think about a life of the life of the work , he may not have a better idea of how a down life could look like because he has no better idea of we . and it so
and he <unk> say . of his father .
i 'm going to look 're up about them martin .
martin 's
his father was <unk> of the time in to the whole family of the life and the hell and the <unk> in the hell .
when he was 12 , his mother died and he had to go to the home . .
it was the <unk> that was to the big bang .
it are
to the day when his little brother had said in it as i 've look at the friend you have to people in a <unk> of the ground .
and there was a
and he was going a day . .
and so it went .
violence has look at the life that on got his father .
so how do i have a lot is what so i 'm going it to do ? .
after the childhood , many <unk> very <unk> or have <unk> .
they do n't know much different two than their lives and their <unk> .
and then you 're up with people in challenges that are an ca n't like that the idea that they but ? of the same thing that are not a better trend that are not a better deal that . and
what they do , think of these people in common , if you sit together in prison ?
usually about not a lot that . and it was n't good . .
and they 're going to be using important criminals is going to be in the <unk> .
they sell drugs on a higher level , of course the ability we could have we can ? .
and that leads to germany to
that means in germany , every day
and then there are people in prison who then really no way of .
but also , these one people are up with it and
and there is
and everywhere is where they come , is the first identity .
if you look at a workplace , whether they make i look 're up i make i want to look at a apartment a much private relationship with for this creatures , about this identity , which is that you can have 's going a point in moving into society .
this is the problem that we 're . .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what does it do , ?
they 're going to be surprised .
it 's cognitive park .
who has it i on it in i what 's going it to what 's going it has we have a lot in <unk> , these <unk> of
in the theme of <unk> , it 's a little bit of <unk> , you do at the point in prison and he other .
these characteristics are going to use for something positive .
we start with our innovation with i a
we learn i have a basics that 's the basics of the world in to the economy .
every collaborator , his own <unk> , of each want to be part in a serious
and then we 're going to get the one of the people who are looking 're at
what 's going to go out you n't go out in our program ?
it 's a big range of mass to the <unk> to the
we have a <unk> . that 's a <unk> and
a very large touch and
so
he was always going to do the fun of business that was going to do .
he 's been
and these birds did n't have a lot about we .
in a capable of the capable that . of the opposite
he says in really fact , just in i on a second person and <unk> of the second . .
and
he just become it on i was part of a therapy , of the
and there was how he learned how he can use its
he had been used in september in implications , then october
and to be course to get it i be able to live in it .
he has very good <unk> .
he 's now with me . .
who wants i want to talk about it and talk i want to talk . and you make it .
again the time i was living about gates , which we told point to the beginning .
martin has been a education have a education have a cell die that -- you know , in his work you know to the . .
and there are and drugs of drugs to be to to be the cycle that was right quickly .
he worked with
20 years he led they had have this life .
and he says that he 's not going to be able we have to be able it to be <unk> . and it so <unk> of this and . that 's not to the
one day he wrote someone in i are so hard in a
he took the <unk> few and the <unk> there 's actually changed the life .
he learned how he had more power to more models and to more quality of quality of quality of quality enough left enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough i could be course .
and he was so excited about his understanding that just that just he had to do it .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
this is it and that was . of course .
now he works have two way to us and <unk> when our collaborator in us to make when we '' you know , because you had to change , and if you want to change the right tools to the mind that you want to do that his way . .
the basis of these successes are the way they are now as for them .
people who come to prison with us i come to <unk> about our subjects in get when is to
these are our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our class , these are students to make the <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> .
and these are our clinics that our collaborator are directly to the <unk> that so and . that 's what so . and
and also , these people take a lot of our program .
a example .
we 're going a exercise that so
we 're going to go a human
and i think different questions .
and every time , if someone in the space is the question of yes , he 's going to be the species .
and here is what we all have in common in the middle in the <unk> them or outside and outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and a example that are the differences , is the question .
i grew up in a social <unk> to , or i had a lot you had in their never .
there are a 'll many that of when we have i used it to the line of to to the line and just very few of our <unk> .
a question i love to do is that i want to make us all the <unk> .
and i 'm up to ask them 're at all .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all .
great .
thank you .
i 'm up to this if is a question and if you 're going it to do this question , you 're up again , you 're up again to get so much . .
this is a kind that our line of our species that we 're doing now and . .
i 've trying to do it you in my life , and it would people have right . of it the way .
if you do this question with yes , you 're which is up . .
so that -- to one of the car . that 's how to as a car .
it was also able i 'm going it to have a little bit that we what 's going it to have a lot that we have to have a lot of a around
it 's why we ?
okay .
and it 's also going a lot of , long as is not going i always what have been going a lot of the <unk> that you ? .
all right .
most of them -- most of them --
we have a few angels you have in the space .
this is wonderful , there i am happy and i countries .
thank you very much , you 're going to get rid in again of all .
in they ask to the water , like we ask to the face , we 're going to have a lot of a through the <unk> that we have to have a around .
and many , as his luck a lot , you might have . and you before and you on .
happiness with the parents , in the environment , with a little place , with to the friends , but also that you might not always have right now because on the edge of the <unk> or the . of the way . .
what are the results of our work ?
so
this is rapidly fast .
so
one third of the north turn you were in the last year .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i 've been told the <unk> of seven percent of the
i 'm
an
and it 's a nice
and when my father and i went bit mean the
i ended more and my called from a called <unk>
but i have to say , i did n't have to ? it 's not a <unk> why .
we 're going to encourage our collaborator to take responsibility .
responsibility , what happens in your life is happening and all in the way to take responsibility to do on what 's going on in their project .
not to hide , nothing too
because that leads to a very new quality you can also make was able i can something in a little place .
and so it ! it 's very happy and separate when our collaborator are open from your way .
and i have it a thing to do i have it a little video .
movie . .
so i was going to go over over two years and eight months of <unk> .
i was going to be
i 've got to have . .
so , i have been able to be
i was going to be
so , through from my favorites in
and what was important to me was in the where it are also done to not . and it was also done and .
because i was , it are from my absolute
i was not
i 've got out in the rest is a challenge of eyes .
i 've been looking at the time able to look at the back .
and you 're going to go with it with a different consciousness , in order it out of the phone of to to do of the phone that
now the way it was always <unk> to
with to the wrong people , of course , right when you n't . and it 's not more .
well , the problem is , that lot of you what many of the <unk> what to there . that 's a around and the
the biggest problem , because it so is what they 're going to get in a old <unk> .
you know , you think nothing else .
by they
i 'm for
and since i 'm going to go back a lot of top that i 'm up with her .
so that means we started a new relationship .
and because i also changed the whole lot is through he and every other things .
so much that i 've been . of course .
i am in my family in to

every if you can have something that we can need .
if is our collaborator in their <unk>
if you want to have when you want a new program in a new field in it , very <unk> of to to be
let 's talk to you .
martin traditions and i are here today .
and let 's look at the conversation with them .
thank you .
and
in a time i was a little bit . .
there are things like that .
<unk> . .
the <unk> and been going to go .
let so why we on it . . .
there are a around many already of how it can be able to do can be able to be story that you can . .
well to be able we can do it . that 's how you be able to do we can ?
anyway , i was also <unk> .
with my work and so <unk> with the <unk> .
i have to talk to
and not by real problems .
my problem was i are
it was <unk> .
and this
to make 's <unk> .
i had i had a <unk> <unk> and the
someone else . .
i just did n't know , i do n't think of to the <unk> way ?
let me go out all ?
or what if i have from to get from my
and look at what happens .
what you 're going it . .
these were like to be to be the idea and the idea .
i was a lot you in this time to be and . that 's a <unk> .
like
and to the <unk> the
you 're going to be
but <unk> and
developing developing countries will be start a look at see of
and the same over these pictures and
and that was a while for me to be it for a while .
i was a little data .
to fly that .
and also , i found a little bit of <unk> from know about a country that we actually do at all right .
that 's what i wanted to do .
i wanted to do countries right .
to write a
and to celebrate these personal self and a week in my sitting .
how do this learn better ?
you using people . .
in the people , in them of home .
not in the hotel .
by the challenges and the problems of people .
and by doing the if you do .
at least , the answer i could give me this water .
and that 's what i wanted to do .
and also , i wanted to do something like i space . .
i wanted to do a contribution .
something good .
and that reality this web has right to think of a <unk> . . .
i was often before in developing developing countries , but he just took would <unk> think of it of .
until
with a year of
and we continue it to one in the 20 while the world .
a quarter of the population lives under the world of the world and the center and the center of the world .
almost a fifth of the population is based can . and the hours that 's going i have it . .
forty percent of adults ca n't read and write .
all of these facts connected with lot of weeks of stories and teachers in in this studies i met in a time in the where it was ready and open for changes .
i four a little women .
and i way a lot you 've right now a straight process of nepal . .
i quit my job .
and then <unk> know . of course of the aid .
and i 'm going a few in the answer to the answer that it was i work with my <unk> and <unk> that .
because they just are a <unk> and it was .
it 's going a lot in the <unk> of the <unk> and . .
and not to be i about 's
hi ? .
does it go ?
and from my opinion a lot of it -- really serious . .
at least , i thought . .
and this answer was an
i really was i 've said .
and of course , of course , there was a very emotional answer .
never <unk> .
instead , it 's going i 'm going i really feel a funny reality of on what good <unk> .
i used it not as disaster i have i have i have a own company .
<unk> .
<unk>
a company that 's exactly about on what i 've been looking at .
which is the possibility of trying it to see 's a country .
the possibility of a country right .
by the if i do with now , in i take a why .
and it so people be able to work somewhere , but in october
and
so <unk> and <unk> .
that means so much like to collect down to to ?
you can do good .
it sounds very little bit more
but it so not that . .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use material if we use a tool for sustainable development .
in thank this , we use <unk> for choices for sustainable development .
so <unk> , <unk> of the way and pakistan that
because the people who are trying it with us to make i n't afghanistan .
they pay for their journey , like to might as i 'm up can .
but they just travel .
they live on
and the goal is not a every where for a around a around , do a through a lot of the
social engagement .
<unk> and <unk> and
and then when our collaborator are the <unk> in to <unk> of the <unk> and interests in different projects .
we can make a lot of work in our work in the <unk> of i used we had no chance a chance of i had a chance . that 's a chance of the classic problem in the size you time of the did and .
because just the infrastructure is missing .
we can make a sustainable projects .
we can make a sustainable projects . that 's what so we ? of course .
so we 're going to take us a hundred percent itself .
they 're people not to be able a lot .
and this this this is just about the kind in terms of meaning of meaning .
we started with our work with when we were working on when we were working this why .
<unk> year we have when we had because of our engagement on uganda .
and now after four years , i 've been going we got to come you of , and my husband and i have a team of a team of a team .
let so go to the <unk> way ?
or what if we think more . .
if we go to the
if we do n't just make quite social engagement and sustainable it’s going i want it to do that n't is in another waving ?
and so the individual <unk> ?
or even by to the <unk> film . .
so in idea , this this this is could project it 's a new company .
a company that connects to businesses .
but with other <unk> , the same philosophy like
do we want to do that ?
the next question was .
<unk> new businesses ?
sure we want to do that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative businesses .
because we 're going to get the three . that 's the use .
because we 're talking about language . .
because we dream to dream the doing the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges
and so we 've life in for this year , a sister has look at a sister .
<unk> .
and with the
we 're going to do the collaborator that we what we have to do with creative organized with to creative businesses with the images of film . .
so the sitting of the weeks and
and then
there are also a lot is to <unk> .
a use of a lot of a down
he shows you you in it is a around short time in where you 're going we to ? that 's where you 're going to go that
you might have a every map you what you ? .
you might as a little bit that you might be able a little data to see . and you know of to the way and it was . .
and he shows what this is good .
leads to its before .
it 's the creativity , the suddenly , the great thing is . and it are great and the great .
or it 's the 1990s you 've right in . and it so .
the hydrothermal well things that you can do this . of course and do all .
and the force , things that you can change .
and you can change very much .
in very short time .
we know that .
a example of it and a example .
these are the
these are five very wonderful women from uganda .
and about
she are
and since we want it for did . .
because they did n't have the market for it .
because they did n't know how they can improve the quality . .
because nobody said , what you before is the country .
we wanted to help these women .
and so that 's why so in they start as an
``
products get out in poverty .
you give you a income .
a interesting way .
we went out yesterday about our <unk> life .
and we start with a typical
one
you my before is people just for a year .
but allows us to make the project a lot larger and a around and make i think here and . and
and the than this
so who wants to support , to do have i be course with i can something like a recipe i can go it with the want to go to the one in the world in a project .
he can travel to the women and <unk> .
in terms of , so we do n't want to give you five place a take a work but a speak of a little women or a hundred .
and that 's not just in jazz , but in nepal of nepal of nepal that we 're live in .
but this is to for for this
we 're working in all the central areas .
in the area of the
because the work is just going i just have we just . .
what happens to children when women work ?
right .
so that so , we 've started this year this year in nepal and in uganda have two
everything else they 're going to go over in our light . .
and the whole thing is more meaning as every matter of the project .
collaborator we 've live you to <unk> is in the different projects .
and so a lot of ways of the way have been able we have to work in the common work .
and then so , we no journey i want a journey to a journey .
and i 'm up a eyes to close a eyes .
and you 're in high school .
in rural heart of jazz .
you 're on it is in i called 's <unk> in the sky and . .
and they '' and <unk> .
you 're going i 've right it with then <unk> that . .
there was
<unk> .
elizabeth .
the walls are <unk> .
here you but at to as i 'm going to do it .
you 're <unk> these degree . .
and look at children with
your
you 're going to go with really
and also to is a thin layer of the
kids topic of . and they outcomes that
and they '' to forward really . that 's going it . and they my name .
you 're going to call is in is not very
<unk> .
you do n't know how late it is .
but soon , you 're going to get up .
and the <unk> , on the moment that they my create the end of the children . .
at the end of the street , there 's a big tree .
you 're going to meet you with the
in the case is in to the shadows of the tree , you 'll has a much study that 's here in to the world was the new designs of their own <unk> of the world that 's up .
so the way is going i 'm up about hands and feet .
later , the other women are going to do and . and
they smile in the way .
until is the
under the tree .
in the known .
incredible , there are the company .
tomorrow 's
you 're going to get you a little women . .
the exchange they are health and more . .
and also the way , we 're also going to talk to talk to the where we my own .
you <unk> care .
and this
mother
they sing i call it a thing that you '' .
you 're smarter and happy .
you can do the eyes again .
every one that can be able a little women can ? and then they from i have a new mind in i . .
or at least a short time , the hat start again of a every well of time .
and look at what happens .
thank you .
before i start to start myself , whether you what they -- is you what you 're here , you would have the
i do there with to the less , but maybe someone wants to do .
here 's the bottom that we do and . of course and i ? .
two .
so really to to the top of the camp to a moment a moment , but on every case , there 's two , that 's beautiful , we 're just too
and i 've his ask , and i have a home of the <unk> in the city of the city .
this is the building .
together with twice the make , i 've said , in the last summer , six months .
and so i 'm up with in figure how to you here .
well , you might say some of you now of the did of you .
what 's going to do ?
there 's a lot of them and a lot . .
but i want to explain it .
oh , what do you know all a lot is ? .
and then is her of it in park in tend to the older park ? .
just a little selection of questions that have also known of time the friends a friends who on the ones who what i 've said to do is that i 'm off a somebody has to be <unk> as it 's a
all of the russians you had to have
and here about this and
and to be against a <unk> that 's <unk> that <unk> and <unk> and . and
but who knows , that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was not the <unk> .
what we see here is a sign from
this is a public space that 's done in the time the private , in many one of people the
we were a group of <unk> in the desire with
and we wanted to tell a other
we were an
from the areas quality of architecture , linked political n't -- politics ,
of course , with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives
and we allows actually allows time a lot of skills you be story with same networks .
and creative <unk> solutions in the <unk> of the
we actually have a
but we went to the
we 've asked memories and images .
and from these memories and images are trying to develop possible perspectives for the <unk> .
it are important to us in the process of the process .
and when 's how we have surgery i 've right now as an
so ,
on to the experiences that we did that i actually what it was talking about and it 's . and
every city is
one of i have a neighborhood .
in many cases , these are
they 're the dead places of a city because they do n't even expect what was going to be in a public space .
so for example , we have <unk> , <unk> .
and they '' are going a lot of the public , the urban friends , that 's going a lot of <unk> and the
initiatives that make these friends want to go to go we have i what they 're going to have to do you have in the pacific of life that they from . and
what has to there with me , like some questions , like some questions like this the water of taken .
i mean , a lot . .
and these friends are not just a nature .
no .
they 're the quite social places of our city , in which because that 's going a lot of life .
so we often do that 's the than the first of to our neighbors , if 's going to go to the way of to go we to go we to go we . of the way .
and can this beings i on , like we have a professional possibility , and actually possible the way that the spaces are going a way it 's going i have .
and we actually on
and for think that they 're going to be used i be start can in . of course .
but what 's going to do this is a sense of community .
the more , i think that in a often public space , the faster and the more and to be able a community .
and if i do n't get <unk> to , then on on what you 're going to do is that this this this is called a
we were at over little challenges .
we can see consciousness to consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood or the
how can explore it you ?
how can washington not come years ?
fortunately india and <unk>
imagine that you sit here , once for you to works a stores on of to look '' and read . .
love <unk> and citizens , we have a lot you to have a around three issue on to the <unk> of <unk>
they 're supposed it i need it to be able to do the should be a option of the ca n't .
and the option with most of to the <unk> , then <unk> . and then they '' .
would you go ?
would anyone come to they go to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds great .
there 's i think in terms of the did .
they 're allowed to get
and as i said , just great time this first saw .
i try a explanation have to me of a parallel .
and because i do `` think that you 're not really going a really , or <unk> , <unk> .
first of the first time , the classic <unk> health is single much more too math .
that means , mostly they other felt a architecture , 've been able it to make a sense that are 've look at the ability we have to do , but there are really peace and for know a lot that they 're going to do , half of know a <unk> very .
or , like a friend recently said what color is
second explanation a through
think of to any three <unk> buys that . .
we have what we want to show you , of course , you know , you think , you know to you .
frustration and <unk> are often the implications of what i kind you have . .
i do n't want to do that husband , of story , if we have i what so i want it to as i would have
but it 's also different .
even though the <unk> that we what 's going i have to do is , we what we have a lot of talking can have i have a lot of people in the way that we have a lot of <unk> .
and we have a lot that we have to do the happiness that i want to share now have i want to share . .
i want to do it to want a bit that i make it on want to look `` other projects , but also , or especially in the politics of politics .
because the ones that are the ones that are actually wanted a lot of things in the did that are actually going to do it what -- they these kinds that are responsible for these kinds of processes .
and if you have a interest this interest in a container , as often as well the <unk> you 're going i need to do that to as it so the new <unk> of the way that we need . .
not finally , <unk> the time so i all of had a lot of that for know that this this this is . .
so because so i think , up , how i would think of it for very important .
i think it 's for important that is all the way the way , and i want to encourage you with our example , which they 're up a chance to give is it .
and i 'm going to get all of think that you as the ones who -- they be able to get a say in a much more . .
so we need to look at gravity i have to look at the heart of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and <unk> and <unk> there n't .
first of the ability a bit in
in the
what we see here is a hacker in here we had to have .
what we see here are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation . .
the goal needs to be able a lot in <unk>
the citizens of the place are experts , they are experts for their neighborhood you think of what they 're missing with a place where the required is , and new , of what you ? . .
the <unk> , especially in the city can do what 's going to do this in to
in the 1990s by in a particular case , then the kinds in terms in a cost in to be a through i 'll as a lot of things that are going on a project . of the project .
and in fact , it extreme to a <unk> , which is all the man for at all of all and 've been going to be going to be a place of the place
and kinds that can be able to get rid that allows a tumor in i . and
a dialogue on
and then when someone says , i want to do i make i no one in the case of the case of to the test that . and i want i want a <unk> .
that be
how said that from a dialogue . of course . .
second point are
our <unk> is <unk> .
one is really desire it 's up when just <unk> <unk> saying . of course and talk .
and one in want a lot of a lot you can do is , do n't want to do the door to talk can not talk about the text .
one of people before you might be able a little data or photographed
or build his ideas into
what i want to say it has to be different <unk> a every single way i 'm going a lot of a around . and it -- .
so , have the function of simple the way a way i have to come up the want to be on to as well . .
in the background , small cow .
we had the possibility to give up
we had the possibility to paint .
we had the possibility to write .
regardless of the age .
this was a <unk> sun .
we had the possibility to connect our war with faces to <unk> history and <unk> six history .
the possibility of <unk> <unk> is space , should not be used that that should be . .
so for too example , you can happen about a <unk> , that can happen in
the <unk> and <unk> availability of the results of the results .
we have a end that allows at push with facebook , of the same did , and the same news is going to be able a <unk> ... of the same thing .
our third point is
you might remember that i said in fact that i 'd like i thought you 're often going to be too math .
in my favorite event , there were any
and
if you want to focus with the conversation , and i 'm going to look 're going to be the feel <unk> , which is going to come to the case in the love .
<unk> is also going to be a
and then , if people are
what happens now when they from a thinking of their city and the city . and the thinking of the thinking .
now , you 've been in a around issues . .
i 've got a example from
in new york , just a side project was going to be a project . .
in the
the time was in copenhagen in doubled , the politics could not be different than the idea of get to their own .
and the <unk> of the
in the opposite , the <unk> for a
in <unk> , we 're back back in germany , the citizens of
the city had been used it in to be
and to
today , the <unk> of the city . and the thinking of the thinking . .
while the page
together to curious their problem with their own . .
in rotterdam , a <unk>
all right now , you want to say now .
and then we just do so on .
but i think it 's wrong to make the city of responsibility .
why ?
one , out because they its look on it very , by the way .
while the traditions i what they my own this they 're going to have to focus on a form of the rule of the rule of the city of the city of the city of the city you 're at a bit that are the edge that are 're 're `` `` i n't business i <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and for other of course , when the city is going to be the projects , the want to have to have to on i ? that 's the way .
one
and our goal was also i had i see a little used to be i was up it for we see the results and the responsibility to the city .
<unk> are an
it 's still <unk> .
so , unfortunately , we have the problem that we could n't take the predict even more . .
but we know that like the city of the <unk>
but in terms in terms of the way the other did this this is still open .
to come a lot of that the lot in to be that lot that of the meaning of their meaning , complexity or also , the himself of to the city have a chance to have a effect that have been trained we have to make happiness and created . .
if you 're going a moment in time and in a conversation . .
in the city and citizens and citizens .
in the city of a thinking of at the city , of 're at at all that is where they sit here .
if we do because of when we do when was the <unk> of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of to be were more thing as a breath , but as an
that 's it .
now , caught on to
we talked about <unk> .
so this idea , even more important wants i have to on this work , and us just have it just i think of to the second chance .
we found very interest .
and we were very quickly to us you have two go to actually that 's going a time we did n't kind of time .
one is the surprises of . .
the second thing was , new times in a table the where it was in school ?
except .
except .
school , some of you might remember ,
it was so much about to me , now the <unk> did , but the words lead a lot you a lot you to ? and i years
my neck <unk> and i want to go back to it .
and then i do n't know how it are in you , do it space in from my breath to to be to the <unk> seriously , who are always going to go to me .
no idea of what was could could be .
and they 're going to understand it , and from from my time to do there , and after it , it was really reasons the last one you had was ted , never .
and what 's going a lot of , i 'm going a lot that i 'm going i had to do in to the year of the most beautiful learn that i spent there . we spent in schools .
and with human desire of big desire that go is everyone .
how did it come ? and how did it be ?
how could that happen ?
and we just started to do this this is what so themselves is happening in the want to do . .
i got kids .
so my wife got the children and the times and the believe . .
and therefore the obvious back is that they had it i get to do that
and a day when she said , `` honey is <unk> .
and today you 're going to go .
yes the
and i ended were the door and then i was sitting is in they
and that was how 's what 's going to look '' in to could .
and the <unk> if i but
and when i read to the named and is you know , the kids do n't learn for school , but for the life of the life it 's
what is that what so we were in school , actually , for i 've right ?
so many of us have learned there all said there .
where did you have been able to have a lot that you lot to n't lot ? of all also ?
and maybe some of the things like to do the capital of the same . .
what is another where ? of course ?
and
good , i got to ?
and what does a lot that tell you a question you want a good doctor ?
if to
except .
so , except with we live , not for school . .
if we look like this , so about <unk> years , the middle of the <unk> century , there are the case you have . and that are like is . that 's how we have .
this is the time in germany , the
and where we have the computer system to do you with the roots .
and if we imagine the time in the time , it was like the one of the people in the time , the people had no access to the time .
and there were these four or six years that they were forced to go to the school and with millions of the time to what are to have i was to have a only possibility that had to have to have a wants we have to know about to the write and the facts and to her <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
now the
and the middle of the <unk> century , that was the time of the <unk> .
that means , there 's a different watch in the world and there were all the people that your his new machines could get know .
but at the same time , people need i need to wait and repair he will go .
and we needed people who could make these machines and make these factories .
maybe you know it and . and you know .
the <unk>
and has trying a sense of meaning .
also to be like in to the time , what it was in school in help , have said to the work in to to be a
let 's take a lot in the future .
let 's take to the
the year was
i was done with my study and thought , an point is now , now you 're going to take is your those first company .
yeah , after some of me , the exactly , then we
and some businesses are <unk> of actually , that were always going a lot of of actually , and we were course , of course , and we 're going to grow here , of the somebody who do we have to go even in a free case .
you 're going a lot of time in life .
and we had a few years of 30 did .
so , we had a beautiful growth and we had how much which <unk>
i do n't know whether they have been able to make a lot that these people do , but i did there in school , we did n't have a idea that it would ever be like in and . of what they had .
even when i was
and the children that we have they '' in school today are the per per job , which they '' in 10 , <unk> i what 's up to on the age of years or worked ? .
the only one of the great piece of the game we do all do n't what we do .
and what know what facts are going to have to be successful in these future jobs ?
and if you 're honest , there 's to the only answer , we do n't have a idea .
and because we 're going i look now in the future of the future , because the <unk> that are going it to be <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
there 's
well , you see , you do n't have a idea .
how do we get out of work for life ?
what are the things that we need to do to do children what 's going a lot that ? .
and maybe a look at on about what businesses are doing called employees of people of people and .
these -- these -- are the
the <unk> of schools and universities are coming in to the businesses .
and if you look at the same as i also also also look at the same time , there 's the first thing that you see , what to ?
so , there are , are the pieces of the read , we 're looking at the
and that 's going to be in school and not can not photo .
but what could have also afford a lot that are always going to be , the things that are always important to
and that can be <unk> you in three groups .
this this is a company , businesses want to be willing i want i want i mean i years , so that 's not i 'm going it .
and then almost all businesses are took can think with
and then these businesses are going a <unk> that --
so we have <unk>
let 's start with the muscles and . of it that
this is relatively fast .
if we look at the economy of the economy , as industry this is , how industry this is all changing in .
and
and we what we have to have to have to on the ones this change .
and we on the ones get a smart .
and i on to have a lot of the employees the
this is pretty exactly the opposite of what you had in the factory in to
and the means that a information issue have right now is relatively clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's about people , the responsibility . .
first time and get really your life .
but the big whole thing .
and like that now , the businesses this this is as worked not as society , we want to take people to why the great whole thing . and that was going a whole thing of the way and the whole children of the whole .
and the third factor , the <unk> , which is almost the most of a <unk> .
and if we remember the <unk> of
argentina was
it was n't quite release it so the
that could be able to do in eight .
and so someone who are , you think of the change you know , steve jobs , steve jobs , yeah , <unk> .
it was not to to have the iphone , who other did there , their
the team that had trying to do that , going to be possible , out , because the eyes could do that you what for you .
so high live that time they could something is that 's going i have to learn to live in the way we learn for it .
but there are even
and that 's the learning itself and .
if the only thing we can say about magazine they can say this is not the gives you to business and make it new a lot a every where we have to have a lot of learning that we 're going i have to do , in the future you 're movie you are successful you <unk> '' <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but the <unk> live , here these been these things .
but where was i ?
i was in that
so , not the where so i want it to be all i told , there -- ?
and to the point where they from
yeah , i was there , and what should it say to the <unk> that of from my kids were , these
less . it was for them as a father , when it so , going i think as it are can about to talk can the reward and turned how i ? and learn the entire
and even less fun is , an child is identify because in school .
and finally , these
it do n't have a <unk> , and it was a
and i 'm going to look at the details of you now , and i think we about a child , we need a single child on it a child .
<unk> -- but two years we have to see the way , there is nothing and not and works that of . .
what do we do wrong ?
and we actually had the question of this this child ?
and are we the only one that 's going to go there ? .
now , i 've been talking about the started in to the last two years , and it 's right in a theme of a lot of people , and i 've right now the learned that is not alone .
there are a lot of the well a around , and that was a lot that was two other years ago , and i was working about
and what should i say , he has the three story telling think of to if 's the use of one that , very , as so 's , that we had that so that was that we had because of our kids your five end of school , yes ? .
in berlin , there are the
but can everybody take out there ?
somehow , it are a little bit of a little bit , or make out our kids in please and make they right how what for them . .
and after we have the idea of the sense to the time , in the time , we did there , we did at the right , 's now , we thought , 's different , we 're the first that we on to do to do in i . that 's what to ? . and to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
just how do we need i change it there ?
the good thing is that we have <unk> and .
we 're not alone .
but we 've right now question very quickly the believe of great one of great one of the things like we wanted to do , which is how 's the
it 's not so much is that the children and their parents are under a lot that there 's going a lot of times all kind of . .
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look at the number of the <unk> of
can it be now that all parents do what ? .
that all children are often the same thing the teachers are killed at the same ? .
or can it be that we have a factory in here that does at the way that the <unk> of the <unk> years each other years ago , the ant different .
and we found a lot of people who went and we love people who have no children .
and they understood that they need to take responsibility to take predict for the future of the future , by going a responsibility to what 's going to take our kids and the kids that are an open we been in working about the way .
and we have <unk>
and there are even one by the or want to be able a lot that you be able to go to go to go to go to the those first theory and go of the first step .
and how should we help ? .
we did n't have a concept that we could do now .
but we can go to the schools and we be able i can go in these schools and we can go to these schools , and the parents , the teachers and the students and we can go a around in back in two days .
so there are people who worked in the past , and the turned in two days , what it information means a work in . and it so
and that -- in ca there are a around bad innovation that they do in green and we can experiment and
and after two days , and 've got a new <unk> , very <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> the new york of to the
or the have said in
within little days in scale the way you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able a day .
but what 's what so to to ? this this is what 's happening in these two days , and that 's what it 's like this have a few woman we have to spend in the south stop you also to stage the less energy that are going a way to business .
if the three things in common are in scale , which is how <unk> and
so you people would think of <unk> in the where and now if they experience i have we experience a team .
and 've been it was so it so <unk> and the
and if we look `` <unk> and so . i look 're going to look at the <unk> school the school started i 've got to change the working on to find that there is completely new culture .
and that 's either
and i 'm going to be
i 'm going to be
and i 'm going to go it to tell you to talk about school , to talk about school .
talk about what you like , ?
they 're going to be surprised , going a lot of <unk> and how many people have the same thing the same , ?
let 's take every looked in germany in germany .
let 's change the whole education system .
and let 's take in green about the one tell to to do the school for talk a day , with the parents and students .
because we be able a lot that we can do .
thank you .
