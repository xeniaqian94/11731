yeah , good ladies , my gentlemen .
so thank you to talk to the invitation to talk to this .
and i have to imagine myself .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm rather , <unk> word , <unk> in the city .
these are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : first , the personal , two , the public is the public policy .
so i am responsible for the city of the city .
and you do n't do a popular thing .
i know .
and beyond , and that 's something that 's a son , especially i am also <unk> .
that 's what i call is the boss 's hero , and she 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and i 've got to have a subject of , of course , is important to think about it , with the point of what i want to do with you today .
and that 's what the topic of <unk> , because it 's a person who 's got to fire .
we hope to be the best and they 're doing the worst of the worst , which is called jack to the first of the first time .
you know it .
he was at general <unk> .
and then i 'm just going to begin to say something so much .
i 'm going to give you a way .
so we talk to a risk of a problem , for example , we 're going to be a long time , for example , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
many people are the road .
it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> .
and somewhere in the edge , a suitcase , lonely , <unk> , maybe <unk> with you .
nobody seems to be part of it .
the suitcase .
suddenly a <unk> .
leave the <unk> .
police comes , <unk> , <unk> .
people call us .
<unk> <unk> .
go out .
what is going on ?
we do n't know , or we ca n't say it 's not .
people leave the building .
kids cry .
some of them might even fall because it has to go quickly .
suddenly a piece of communication .
there 's a <unk> inside .
i 'm going to panic .
i hear here .
the rest is i going to talk about your imagination .
but it 's no imagination i 've got to <unk> . <unk> ?
this is what happened in this week in the <unk> week .
there 's a pair of suitcase .
afterwards , it turns out , in a way that only in <unk> , nine pounds of drugs were in .
but people were just like that , and so a friend tells me that , which is a kid in the building .
it was not told .
and there was just this particular piece of a sudden , at least in the group who was my friend in my friend .
god is not <unk> , otherwise that would n't be as safe in the way it seems to be white as it seems to it .
you see in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster , in a <unk> disaster , in communication , communication is a very important .
communication is important because people are because people are being in this situation that are <unk> in communication .
you want to know what is going on .
in the good , old time , the authorities was just pretty simple .
we just have n't told or we 're lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> .
you 've got to say , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , god , god , who are not going to be <unk> , because we do n't rather say the truth or we say the truth .
this is in a period of social media , in a period of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public health , in a time of <unk> and public tv .
and , just , and , you know , it 's just because it 's not moral , and the second is , is , and most of it 's mostly , is we 're going to be the last one , and the last thing is the spoken to report .
you might remember the <unk> in the hudson river , which is a couple of year ago .
the first one was about twitter .
and from somebody who was a ferry and just <unk> , and i immediately <unk> , there 's a plane <unk> and we save the people now .
this was not a <unk> .
you see , we rely on the way , we 're just <unk> and really intense in the state of the world 's worst , and really <unk> the truth .
because most of the past , of course , is the last thing that 's what we know , is the truth of the truth because we need to be as a state of law , of course , of course , is that we only get to <unk> information .
and there 's public media or private media either do n't be so much as much or they do n't do it .
so , of course , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's something that 's been going to have been around the media , and we 've got to think about how we deal with the future .
and we 're going to get out the good old <unk> .
but only as a form of <unk> .
that 's what we 're going to have about a hundred years of <unk> in the <unk> , which is , some of you know , when it 's just coming to the <unk> .
it was used to be .
you may know what you know , what 's first , in short , and once a second .
i do n't know .
we 're going to have the problems of all the <unk> , which we have to have this place , so , over facebook , over facebook , over the radio , and the local media and the local media and the local media , and in the way , with <unk> , to become more connected to
and we know we have to be very quickly and <unk> , and we need to be a very quickly very quickly and <unk> and <unk> and citizens will be happy .
and we do n't even think of what we want to say , what we want to say .
communication in the crisis or in the disaster in the crisis , so in a long time , is a question of <unk> about all media , and it 's also a question of the credibility .
the existence is our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens are either saying , `` citizens '' and say , you 're not going to <unk> it , or say , `` you say , it 's all worse than it is .
so we 've done a good experience with facebook and twitter , recently , recently .
and they may have taken some of these are taken from the media .
we 've had a bigger <unk> in food had a larger <unk> .
and that 's what we call it called chemical weapons .
these are bombs who are introduced with a <unk> <unk> , because it 's not even when they 're going to explode up in the first <unk> in the world 's <unk> , but by the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the world , and only in the ground in the ground , and only in the ground in the ground of war , and only in the ground , which is that a little metal <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> of each other , <unk> two <unk> <unk> from each other , and then it came to the explosion .
the problem is just a lot of these suitcase did n't work and they 're like in the <unk> of food in food .
and there 's a little bit of <unk> , who were his conscience , he said , `` well , '' we 'd like to go , he 'd been able to be like it , and now , he 'd be able to be informed , and now ,
by the way , several times , at the age of <unk> , has been reported in the whole <unk> .
we 're going to see what we find .
these suitcase were immediately immediately , not <unk> , but <unk> .
and so we just have a <unk> park and , and , in a sense of a sense , a bomb , a bomb .
and in the story in the story of the city , the entire communication in the city of the city , over facebook and twitter , with the consequence of the <unk> is far more about <unk> <unk> .
and the media was excited . laughter in the background .
we did n't even had to get with the phone who had the phone , but they have <unk> and <unk> , everything about <unk> and twitter .
the whole whole great effect for us , because the overhead is going to be <unk> in these social media .
so , just , you have to give me a sign when i want to stop .
i ca n't see the watch .
this is the credibility that 's because of because first of these social media has to have a advantage that they 're safe to share .
not so very <unk> , because the members of the <unk> or the <unk> , how you call it , a high school .
secondly , early <unk> .
if anything is not true , you know , someone 's going to be , and someone immediately , the overhead , the personal , which i 'm talking about , is , because the entire community is involved in the <unk> .
and it 's a very high <unk> of <unk> , so if anything is wrong , it can be really very quickly .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said , `` well , <unk> , which is what a <unk> found up in the <unk> park .
so from all of these things , we 've got this in the last years , and there 's a lot more than a <unk> thing than <unk> , when you know , as a <unk> of a white .
the city can eat every day from the <unk> of a disaster .
one bomb that has to be done in a park , certainly not a <unk> .
but you can also find out , and then we 're just going to find out of the <unk> , and then we 're standing on our <unk> and try to get back in seven feet .
and if you think , you think of <unk> , you think of other cities , if you have to do , because they 're going to <unk> a so-called <unk> , which is not going to be <unk> , then we do n't know , a lot of houses , a variety of homes , not going to be able to look like before .
and that 's important to communicate , one of the one thing is , because it 's just a world of <unk> , to make communication , to do communication to worry about it , to do that people are going to be supported to carry on to worry about that people are able to work on this difficult situation .
and the social media also help us be involved because , eventually , in the communication , and it 's not just a <unk> , '' and certainly , in the <unk> , and certainly in the <unk> of the <unk> .
so today , today 's <unk> , not only is a task of the authorities , not only a task of the fire department , or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is the <unk> , but communication in the disaster and does it all of a disaster and does it all of us .
and <unk> has shown this .
there 's a lot of twitter and over facebook , when you were a lot of aid , if you were just too much more , because of the <unk> of people were just made a little bit of <unk> , and you did n't have no longer in the world , and you did n't know where the <unk> .
and that 's what we 've done , there 's a lot of things that also has too , for public communications in the <unk> , but the unprecedented present , the unprecedented , the unprecedented , the unprecedented , the unprecedented , the unprecedented , the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> , in the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , in the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , is that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication system is not even more way to think .
and i hope i 've been being really excited you 've been a little bit convinced that this medium is actually being used to be in <unk> and the purpose of the world , which is also going to be a new instrument , and in the world , to the world of the world , and also to be a new and the world , and the citizens to be in the future of the health and the citizens , and the citizens to use and learn how to be a lot of the <unk> and the citizens , and i 'm going to be very much , and i 'm going to be very much , and
thank you .
so , a beautiful night .
i 'm a little bit different .
i 'm a writer and i 'm a writer , like you 've just heard .
and i 'm just now , just a personal story , i 'm going to give you a little bit of a <unk> .
what it 's is that i 'll make there is a <unk> , which i 'm going to do you in a moment .
before i do that , but i have to <unk> some things .
the first is , i think , i think we need stories to live .
that we could n't live with stories .
and also i think that there 's a lot more <unk> , <unk> stories , more than the entertainment industry .
and i think i think that the internet , which is infinite , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , is really <unk> right now .
and four , i am convinced of that , that people are created , is creative .
and they 're happier , once you can be happy .
the more people happy , the better , it 's the world .
it 's logical .
now , this better world is now a crime rate .
first , i am , how i said , marcus : the storyteller .
and the story i want to tell you , is going to be in midnight in a <unk> , in the moment of happy <unk> .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> birthday .
now you get it from the <unk> and the singing with it , because in the moment , it 's going to be considered to be launched in the end of the next time , something that 's happened to her .
it happens in your head in your body , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really do a little bit .
you do n't know what 's going on .
but i have words to do it .
i call this the magician <unk> .
you see , you see , in a page and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite black .
i 'm kind of quite <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we have the two of the country in the country with very much color .
and it was in this point , and it said that i 'd be better , and write as i read .
so , the first thing , what is now with her new perception , is a stranger man , who says , she 's very serious at her , and says , `` congratulations , ''
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they heard a very special way of people .
she was born as a <unk> .
and players are people who have to be <unk> at their <unk> , to play their lives .
who are the <unk> who are <unk> ?
very nice .
imagine , you know , the <unk> in this <unk> is not <unk> , if you get each other , but <unk> from the pocket .
so , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything possible .
what is really important is , the players have no glimpse of their <unk> .
we do n't know when we die .
i wish everyone 's life , but we 're just not just not .
it can be all over all over all .
and so , it 's what it is in my players .
you do n't know , in order to do how much they can play .
and again , this means , every lost person could be the last .
a player who has its entire life is seminal in the moment of the moment of the <unk> , like a candle that 's going to be a <unk> .
now , of course , you can ask , if you 're so dangerous , so that 's how hard to play ?
the answer is quite clear : that 's what it is .
without play , without a player , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it 's a player , it 's actually alive .
they were born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how you 're looking at the world of the player , and of course , their first challenges , in love , that 's the story i want to tell .
and in a form of a <unk> .
the first one was 12 , i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry here , i 'm going to see a <unk> , i 've only seen too late .
so 12 , 12 , 12 , in the first season , there 's a distance of five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence of the other , beautiful <unk> , you know .
television has nothing else for its <unk> .
that 's not new .
and if it would be , i 've got up in the first time .
and there 's not one thing .
now , it 's just right now .
let 's go back to <unk> .
what is the most famous sentence in the movie or from the series ?
it can be one , right .
thank you .
when we had practiced .
and that 's true of my player 's true .
and there 's all the many of them can be very much .
there are many different games .
think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
and that 's how <unk> is also the number of players .
and so , and so there are a lot of stories that are all being told .
now , the next question is : who is the next thing to tell you ?
i 've already have a fairly high opinion of me .
i think , `` extraordinarily , very powerful and extraordinarily creative .
but i know that hundred brains are more than one , even if it 's mine .
so , this was just to the idea of that , you know , the crowd of the creative process .
what if we do n't just do n't just talk to a <unk> or allow us , but even more precise ?
so if you say , we 're very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much , you know , you 're very much , very much , a very , very , very , very much , that 's a , that 's the development of this <unk> system .
imagine , for example , in the event , a <unk> appears to find a <unk> , which you 're going to get it totally great , because it reminds them to their grandfather .
and they also are a huge fan of <unk> .
and then you can just do , with technology , that 's not a hard one , a <unk> .
and this is the store on the <unk> , where it 's right , and that 's really cool <unk> , which is really hard to be really interested in .
that 's not somewhere , but it goes straight to the right there , where it 's going to be .
and the real nice is that we are in the internet .
and the internet is really all right .
so , the medium is to be allowed to be .
that 's what you can do as a audience you can write , draw what you want to do .
and now , when we look at this structure .
now , this looks like a little bit of <unk> web , right ?
so this is how this <unk> thing is built in common .
and i 'm really convinced of a really <unk> of that , that the internet was born to tell these kinds of stories .
it 's not even so many , you do n't have a lot of , you know , you know , no one .
so , i 'm going to go and go one step further and then you 'll get the viewers themselves .
that 's in a <unk> .
and there 's a <unk> <unk> in the series of <unk> , but in the real environment , which also these <unk> on your cell phone .
and so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , all of these are all very good , are like mobile <unk> and <unk> entertainment .
these wonderful areas that are going to develop very rapidly .
and i ca n't go to the other hand , because i would have six minutes , and i would need a little bit .
we once think together .
everyone 's time it 's from three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> , and then we have the <unk> .
and with this <unk> , i could have the <unk> of the , moment , i have to find that in the short , the <unk> innovation .
the first price gave me the best for the best .
and i have to say , this jury was from <unk> <unk> , from the bank , from the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so , so , all of all of people , should you be my .
and if i convince the convince , with my mind , the internet is right , to revolutionize <unk> structures , by the way , i think , i think i can really convince you .
so .
everybody 's time , why is this one thing that 's so ?
because of this , in this name , all the areas are covered .
and we have one first thing to have the <unk> : who 's it , i 'm on it , you 're the time , everyone 's time .
and then , of course , then , then , the dying of dying .
so , in the series , a lot of have a lot of a lot of .
everyone 's time is , everyone is to die .
and then , of course , there 's one thing , everybody 's even more and everybody 's time in the sense of everyone can come from , if he wants to .
that 's really important .
i 'm coming from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse than when it 's going to be a <unk> .
i do n't know if you know that .
and when you 're in the theater , and then the actors come so in the auditorium and all , you do n't ask me , i 'm not going to me .
and that 's not .
so it 's a interaction .
and nobody has to be .
he can just be just the audience just .
the reason i 'm talking about german is that the whole project is also in german , first .
that 's a couple reasons .
i 'm on this project , and i 've got to go back for the way , and i became still asked me , and i 've been going to go back to the whole , and do the whole thing , the whole thing , number of , number , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ,
so , i just say , german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then the spanish and then the german .
so it 's not so much as we would move into a little bit of light .
i really think i really think i really believe in the way , i really think of the other people who are also like other people who are doing , people will be grateful for something that not been <unk> by any more comfortable with any <unk> , and every single pun <unk> .
so if this is all right now , how i 'd like to have it , the first thing is , now , the first thing is to <unk> the first <unk> .
and if you ask , why i 'm now , because now , here 's a <unk> , where it 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i 've done a couple of thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just symbolism .
i 'm also quite sensitive to <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also also and <unk> .
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredible <unk> .
but it 's not all not anything if you do n't apply it .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just took all of what i 've learned .
and it 's applied .
and so far , it 's good .
i 'm just just going to say .
so , if you think , if you think , i think , i think , i think i 'm really thinking about my own person , i had a sense of a idea of `` <unk> '' or i 've got a idea of <unk> or whatever i 'm doing , and what 's all the way that 's now .
you find us in the internet .
facebook .
great , how the speaker are talking about .
yes , i also have a lot of them .
welcome to : can you delete memories ?
question to you .
can you be memory ?
can you remember anything , what 's happened in your life ?
have you remember <unk> ?
who has who remember all ?
it does n't go hands up .
so , you can do things like memory ?
it looks like .
thank you .
no , so simple , we do n't want to do it .
now , the talk is probably quite a short .
again , good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
now , the talk today , i was talking about this , i took me just two of my passions or my two great passions of my day .
i 've been studied in the <unk> and i 've got to me with bits and bytes and bytes of the bits that are flying so big by the world .
and <unk> , i 'm also a coach and <unk> in private and a <unk> in the private sector .
so on a page , i have a lot of work with the computer , on the other side , i 'm a lot of the world 's role in the human <unk> <unk> , so , how does it work that ?
because how can you change ?
you 've got to give you a comparison .
i was a very interesting discussion in a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when can we build a computer , that 's how the human brain ?
and so , and i think we 're quite close to it .
so i think that 's so two , three hundred years , more than that is not going to do .
but let me go to you , why you might have some things that you need to do .
so , so the comparison between the computer on the one side and our brain on the other side .
so if we take the computer , it 's all , so your iphone , you 'll be <unk> , and also , the camera , and also the <unk> , and all these cameras , and all these smart refrigerators somewhere in <unk> little chip .
he 's called <unk> <unk> , central <unk> <unk> .
these parts are put together <unk> transistors .
the word is already heard , and in <unk> , it 's always as a triangle .
the <unk> little bit , that 's three <unk> and light of electricity or not .
in our computer , we have a lot of <unk> , i 've got a extra <unk> of these little <unk> of these little parts .
and the turn of all over there .
we 're storing things , we 're doing things , we 've got a level of albert einstein , yes , <unk> computer can be a lot of , very much , very quickly , but in fact , it can only be zero and the conversation .
it 's not going to be .
it 's actually pretty much of you .
let 's see it in the brain .
our brains has as a tiny unit , the neuron , and we have it , and we have this one , there 's a hundred billion , so , hundred billion neurons in our gray mass of the mass of the gray , in our gray mass , in our gray mass .
the nice is , our neurons have not only three connections , but it has to <unk> a neuron .
and that 's a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
these are 10 , they were 14 zeroes at six .
so , there 's what you see is the complexity of the brain is about a little higher than what we have in the moment .
if we want to compare the <unk> , maybe maybe maybe the <unk> or another one of the first supercomputer that had their own power boat , ha , <unk> , and with the <unk> of the <unk> , the campus of the campus .
and our <unk> <unk> , but the box is going to have a little bit of over roughly 20 watts .
and the equivalent of two great bananas , so you do n't need to do it , and you do n't and her , you get a computer in a second .
now , if we 're <unk> a lot of a <unk> good at the top , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , why do n't we use the order of why we do , so , then , that 's why , forget things ?
maybe one or another one of the people who looks like the internet , so the person is using 10 percent of the brain , you buy this <unk> to be the <unk> brain .
and <unk> <unk> , a little bit of a little bit .
ten percent , but our brains are in our evolution , we 've got a lot of mass that was <unk> , which is a little bit of in the middle of the middle , everything else has grown up .
that 's not really not happening because we do n't use this .
so why does it seem to be the biggest part of it ?
maybe you know , `` well , you know , '' is the term of <unk> ?
and i 'm just like this is so beautiful as it looks like this , when you see the iceberg in the ocean , the top is the top , then the surface comes down , down the bottom line , down the bottom .
and these 10 percent , that 's what we have to see what our <unk> , our <unk> understood is , but is a black percent of the <unk> , a huge <unk> , a huge <unk> , a huge <unk> , a huge <unk> .
we <unk> the statement of what we have to <unk> , we have <unk> <unk> and more exciting .
and , to get back to this memory , maybe the one or other people who are , or another person who are memory with <unk> memory .
people who have been looking at a lot more detail than i do n't see in the situation , and then i told you , i said , `` well , where do you know ?
and this is , there 's a special , there 's a special , one of the <unk> , so someone who 's <unk> in a field , who 's been <unk> , who 's been <unk> , in a plane , <unk> , so rome , is <unk> , so rome is <unk> , so rome is <unk> , so rome ,
and not somehow , so this is so river , and there 's the same thing , no single house , every single door , every single door , he 's seen , he 's got <unk> , he was <unk> , he could bring up to paper .
where does this come from ?
so why can we do that , so why ca n't it , well , the conjecture is , that 's the conjecture that 's going to be more access to his <unk> percent of the <unk> percent .
now we 're using it , but why can i remember the <unk> night , in all details ?
<unk> <unk> made me to be interesting experiences of interesting experiences .
he 's got to work in the <unk> , and has been working with a rape department , who had its experience completely , that was not the head of mind , the <unk> <unk> of the brain that 's happened .
wonderful , so that was very well , very well .
now , it was about making people <unk> .
there 's a very safe conference in a very safe session , where the end of the end or then could be back to this event , you could n't remember that , then they would see the <unk> of the cars , in which these people could <unk> , that was not <unk> , which was n't going to be <unk> .
and in fact , with this marker , one of the <unk> had been made .
the second thing i found was , he had a lady in <unk> who told her mother who was read in wonderland , and she was read as they had tiny , so four years .
she was sitting on your mother and her mother read .
and then he said , in <unk> , these <unk> , and recorded that , they 've been .
and then she started reading , she was four than that happened , you could n't read this , you can read this .
and then they said , `` tell me the <unk> .
you actually have found a specimen of alice in wonderland where exactly the side of the text that was read , the lady .
so the brain has these side as you was <unk> , when the picture is .
and she could read .
so , we actually have access to that , but we seem to say there 's a way we have to have <unk> kind of <unk> to <unk> us .
now , now , we do n't store the event , but how <unk> said , one of a picture , we 're going to do a picture , we 're going to see what we realize , and what we feel like , what you feel like , if you get a yellow <unk> , and how they 're going to be <unk> , and how they 're right now ,
and , it was a long evening , and they would be abandoned , you 're <unk> comfortable , ha , <unk> , and then i 'm going to ask you , and then you can ask you , and then you just get to your eyes .
and remember , you remember a very <unk> , positive event in the youngest past , yes .
take the first thing .
and , if you do that now , you might have that , you 'll get a visual part of this memory .
you might get a picture , maybe a film , even ?
so , some of them ca n't just do that because we do that normal , but that 's the first time that they do .
and if you see that , you can be in the film you 're either in the movie , from your eyes , your eyes are all of the eyes , or how they look at a canvas .
one of the call we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you very much , you can not solve the thoughts .
who has a visual information , and you get up to hand ?
yeah , there 's a few hands on the hand , which is so , so that 's how to say , <unk> of the most of the things that i have been , is it 's something that i think that 's not something that we do so often that we do n't really think that we do n't have to be a lot of the moment .
well , go down .
and so what 's nice is about memory , if you 're memory , you ca n't get these memory to the memory , <unk> <unk> , we see it 's a positive event , and i would have a little smile , and i was happy , and i would have it , you know , and you know , and that 's the memory of the memory , we 're still
and now , what 's been fascinating .
and in fact , it was n't before , well , yeah , the brain is not going to make a difference between what we actually know , and what we just imagine , what we 're just looking at what we have color .
and also , you can try and try and you might try and you can watch them at home <unk> and imagine something like this is not happening , you 'll get similar information like something that was going to remember what was in the last day .
and , you know , these stories you 're telling you like that , you know , to talk about <unk> , from back .
and then you know , hey , there 's what happens and that , and that was so nice , and the longer the stories are , the nice thing , the stories , there was a lot of <unk> , because the <unk> was much more , there was a lot more higher .
so if we do this in the pretty hopeful , so if we actually change our memories so how we do n't , so , i 'm not to be the basis ?
<unk> , when i came here , my uncle showed me a picture , from his hut in switzerland .
a very nice picture , it 's a very beautiful shack .
only , the picture is `` <unk> , '' so it 's artistic freedom , there 's a <unk> <unk> , because it 's a gorgeous dog , because of the sun , that 's a picture of the alps , that 's a picture of the <unk> ,
and why do n't we do that with our own thoughts , and our own ideas , our own memory , hey , what , because , when i make it , because i do it , if i do that , if i do that , what i do that , which i think of there ,
they actually have artistic freedom in their own thoughts .
you know , you know , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , so , you know , so , you know , so , so
i 've never slept , i had the whole <unk> <unk> .
all the night , and this thought did n't go out there .
i think it 's not going to go out of the idea .
and the son <unk> friend of mine was a little bit of depressed when he came to germany , because his mother stayed in <unk> , and he just did it very <unk> .
what the father did , so he 's <unk> with the son and he said , `` did n't say , '' so , what was the most beautiful , what happened ?
what was the nicest , you know , tell you , and then he got him to tell him , and then he 's going to give him exactly what 's telling you what 's happened to today .
and , in two weeks , it was really the son .
and then there was all right now that the <unk> path is , it 's coming back to visit .
and the whole thing is that the whole youth today is made of the whole , which is one of the most popular people i know .
so , there is not the memories that are shaping us , how we are , it 's our focus on what we need to be .
and how much energy we use to use or use it .
so if you were <unk> <unk> thoughts , and say , this was <unk> , which is so much , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
so what we were looking at , ah , what 's nice , yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who has been really like to do it , you know , `` well ?
and then you take it with this .
take this with your <unk> and let me see the work .
or if you <unk> somebody 's <unk> , it 's <unk> her boss , or her wife , or her wife , or her husband , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
so , you take the picture here , you put a little hat hat , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and let 's jump , you laugh , why do you laugh ?
because they 're looking at this because these are funny , and it 's funny .
and you can get much better with the situation .
so can you know , `` well , memory ?
no , i think our brains have so much capacity to store it .
but it 's nothing because we can choose the answer how strong we focus and how important we think of a procedure , a memory , a thought of thought , it 's coming on us .
my plea to you , you 're playing with you with the images in your head , use your power of your <unk> and give him every day , who enrich your life .
boy : good afternoon .
thank you for inviting .
if i 'm going to ask a party , what i 'm doing so in my school , and i tell you that i have a <unk> with <unk> and do a <unk> , and then i see shining eyes , and in the head of my mind , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> show .
and when i <unk> , it 's a <unk> <unk> to classical music , which is that <unk> <unk> , you know , this <unk> <unk> of the old <unk> , images of old people who are in <unk> , in <unk> rooms and in <unk> , and very focused on the arts .
frank <unk> said to talk about music is so dance .
and so , as it 's similar to what we do .
so you can get a glimpse of what i 'm talking about , i brought a little clip .
film .
there 's something that 's a little bit of <unk> it .
that 's what it brings from my view of the point .
and since <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> are made out , something completely different .
we 're all of these <unk> and middle , and the end of the middle , and the end of the end , and at the end of the end , we had a lot of early in our youth , which is a lot of the incredible force and happiness and delight to <unk> classic music .
but we have a little bit of the idea that the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , you know , there 's a little bit more delight , well , a little bit of <unk> .
and we 're the permanent belief that the future music is not in the content of the content , so on music , but in your <unk> .
so we ask the question , how can we create a <unk> , that music is near the <unk> , the friends and the power again , that 's how we like that .
how can we organize a <unk> , which works beyond the <unk> of the <unk> ?
we imagine the parameters you know from the classical concert , space , time , space , essentially in the question .
let 's take the relationship between the audience and musicians .
you are usually a gulf between the stage .
we 're trying to be a little bit more <unk> .
so here you see a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians sit in the audience , drink beer , entertain people in the <unk> with the world , stand on , are playing two pieces , get in the audience .
all the whole thing is a little bit of a little bit of the evening .
everyone who 's feeling and <unk> , comes back on the stage , and goes back .
or that 's the concert .
in the classical concert , it 's so that you 're on more or less comfortable , <unk> chairs , like you , and i look at the beginning and listen .
but there 's music , there 's no way you ca n't sit still .
and we 've done the idea how you can do this .
when you 're sitting different and you can put yourself in a <unk> piece of music , you 're automatically listening to different .
and that 's how we did n't have a stage , but four stages of the audience .
the audience could have been <unk> .
so i was in the evening in the first row .
and important for us is that we do n't just make any <unk> , but that we 're from thinking of music .
so that we ask ourselves , what are the spaces and <unk> ways of the people , and also , the people need the music that you can do ?
and then , in the way , in the night , in the morning , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , s 's s is actually <unk> by <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , in old <unk> .
but not just the spaces of the spaces and the illumination can be alive and we can now grow music and currently now , but also the connection with other things .
and so we 're completely happy that we 've been working with a few years , with a few years , with the <unk> of the <unk> or in the movements of music , which is not in the dancing of the dance .
and then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , <unk> <unk> 's <unk> or <unk> , from steve reich .
and in this year , we have a , yeah , if you want to get it , it 's <unk> .
we have a concert in the first time with a <unk> system .
we have the story of the soldiers from <unk> <unk> , dancers , <unk> , and they 're <unk> <unk> .
and so that 's also true of all the things that works because we had a big <unk> , which has been supported in this piece .
we have a lot of money from people from people from the people from the way that we could have to be able to have to be generated .
in all , this <unk> is something called a community of community .
we 're completely happy near the <unk> in the city of a <unk> .
and the city is that 's right , which is exactly the size of the new , that we find great spaces and exciting places for <unk> , but also so small that we 're missing .
when the early year in the spring of the year , <unk> of europe are <unk> from europe in the city , then easy to the city more people are normally <unk> .
the whole <unk> is called <unk> .
we 're <unk> , so we 're a colorful <unk> of students and students , medical students , <unk> , <unk> , really completely <unk> .
and to a <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> or coordination or <unk> and funding in the eye , <unk> <unk> , seven to 10 , <unk> <unk> to a year .
but also , it 's also a <unk> , but they 're spending a year for example , for example , the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> in permanent hands are organized and the <unk> .
we all do this in our school and live in a very dark .
this is the largest part of work , and we 're playing in a <unk> .
just three times we 're going to talk about a <unk> weekend , and we 're going to give you a <unk> cycle , <unk> , and another problems , which came up to each other , and have the human being able to be amazing as you want to be
and in <unk> , then , two months , had six to 30 volunteers have signed up with a few days or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks , and you can touch their hands , and you touch with the <unk> , to <unk> , <unk> , in the <unk> .
and of course , in these fourteen age , the musicians come to .
now you could have my , you could have anything you need to be a <unk> .
but our <unk> , we 're still going to continue .
and we have a big community in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city of the city in the city of building us to build us in the city , which is our own <unk> .
that 's the classic <unk> , which is also about very practical things like the quality , there 's a baker , which have a baker , which is a baker , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is available .
the <unk> in a <unk> in the city has made over the entire year and sold .
to be back to the <unk> .
we 've found a whole range of individuals who have had to provide their lives in order to provide the musicians there .
and in this way , the <unk> is going to be a bit of a dedicated to this city and over the people in this city .
they 're able to find out of a very special kind of <unk> , and it 's called this <unk> .
since the early year , we could have been <unk> support by the citizens in a place , which is now , to have the whole value in a <unk> and a reliable <unk> .
we 're <unk> from the stage that classical music is , it 's not going to be it from the right hands .
so we 're incredibly happy about that in the whole , in the whole , young musicians in their own hand , and in the cities of themselves .
and when you ca n't imagine that right now , how to be like , classical music , you get over .
next year , we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy when they 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you may have thought , you might think of the <unk> .
you 've heard about learning or the effect of learning , but i mean , i think , learning <unk> , which is also <unk> <unk> and provide <unk> .
and i 'm going to know what i 'm going to experience is a nice idea of a nice formula for the <unk> .
what i 've learned from art and culture , now , i can say , there 's a lot of natural , because there 's ar <unk> , i 'm in this field .
and so i 've been thinking that maybe it might be a little bit of saying that something like a different title , which is a different title of what my talk is <unk> .
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot of work .
you have a little laughing now .
you get always laughing , although most of the saying , you know .
why is that ?
i think that 's what that has to do with this in the word beautiful , what we ca n't really grasp .
art , we do n't say that , what is what .
now , the fact is , we say that 's what the thing is what .
sometimes .
people who like to work , which has me to me .
but work is that we think about the <unk> and in the art of the art of life , where we 're moving in our lives , and our experiences are going to evolve our own ideas .
and so i 've got my <unk> , which i want to talk to you , in about three hours , which have been all the headline , and that 's what it starts to be very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for childhood , for childhood , and i 'm going to come from inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not telling all of my youth , no concern , i 'm going to give up the word `` i got to explain why i took this for my <unk> .
the interaction for the first part of my professional life and finally , five , was identification .
one of them is going to know these pieces of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn it as a first two , three years , if you teach , i think , i 've been working on .
and so 10 , 11 , i played these little pieces , on the piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , home .
these pieces of a <unk> live .
there 's a melody and she 's played out and the other voice is , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , is a little bit of the art , and if it 's only two voices , and if it 's together , in the presence of the world , in work , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , things , the most of the things that are together , the most of the things that are together , the most of the things that are together ,
and i 've learned to talk to these two , sometimes three , at the <unk> , to play with the <unk> , in the same way , to hear a kind of mess , which is
this was what i 've learned , under other , there 's one thing .
another experience i 've never forget , and i had to worry about it , maybe it could be like this .
i 've got a piano , and i was still in the room , and in the room , i was now , and in the middle of the <unk> , i got out .
i 've forgotten it .
i was a kid .
so again , again , again , i started not just talking about the same person again .
the audience has more <unk> than i was , because i was in the rest of my place , my notes , put them , and then the third time we started .
and they do n't believe me to have me <unk> .
but that was a very difficult experience .
maybe that 's also one of the experiences i had one of the experiences i knew , well , with a <unk> , even though i was going to be a <unk> , i would n't want to go to my <unk> , because you can cheat more easier .
yes , the next chapter of my adolescence , i 've got <unk> with inspiration and i want to tell you stories .
when i was so <unk> , i was to my <unk> and told him , `` i would like mr. <unk> , i 'd like to play a <unk> .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
there 's a lot of <unk> , and very much experience with women .
now imagine a <unk> young man , so , young , like a sentence .
i did n't forget .
and of course , i 've got more working with this .
and i was now , i was in the way , and in a <unk> .
i 've spent working , and i remember a situation that i 've never experienced so .
it was the <unk> of the chopin and now i get to the part of the work , and i just have n't your job , and she was n't going to be in the most beautiful place , and then you had to do the poor , and then they went together , and then again ,
i 'm not going to leave it now , but i 'm not a piano , and i could n't even do it .
i 've got these two years , 30 times more likely to played and suddenly came right .
and then i was playing , and i was playing with a embarrassing , and i just know that i would get me at the ground and laughing .
i was except for me .
i had nothing to not drink anything , and the music has done this with me .
one experience where i 've learned , really , emotions , also to be able to care .
and sometimes it 's right to work that you 're going to work in these <unk> , in these condition , i call it , the <unk> .
where all of the way .
we had this situation in the <unk> <unk> in a organization .
and then there 's almost anything like the way we made the <unk> , that 's just two months , and then you took a half months where you would normally have a year of a year .
well , my experience with the piano , with artistic work with artistic work .
and now i 'm going to come to my student , <unk> .
i was first of the musicians , but just as a <unk> .
we played <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i gave up , and i 've got a lot of <unk> , and so i 'm so much next to my <unk> for the music and that 's what the <unk> would have been .
in choir , in the choir , together , a <unk> singing , wonderful experiences , which i have very , very , very far .
and then one point , where i was a <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> and the <unk> , and i was that , and i was this idea , because this idea came from this , and this idea , from this combination of art , culture , i was in the <unk> event , and to make a job .
and so the art of doing is making culture , to make my <unk> .
so , for the arts , but they do n't be an artist , but it would not say , `` it 's not going to say , '' but if you do n't say , `` do n't you say , '' but as a <unk> , but to do something like a <unk> .
i was there in theater and did me , there was no <unk> in germany , just in vienna , in vienna , and i 'm still working with this question , and i was still with this question to improve the <unk> for art to build a good management , a good management , a good management ,
and that was the reason i did n't stop in my professional life , in the direction of this <unk> , and i grew up with <unk> years , i was then <unk> .
but before , another <unk> , and this stage i have been <unk> with interaction .
i was <unk> , i was to <unk> .
the german <unk> , has his <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , although sometimes in my surprise , because i was born in <unk> , always , the <unk> oliver <unk> , i have to get it to me .
but i have a <unk> root , because my grandparents were also <unk> , and there 's a <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> , i 've experienced the <unk> .
this was more something that i was before i did n't have so popular , and suddenly i got in a different form of culture , in a culture , which lived in the <unk> of people in this <unk> device .
once the <unk> of us , the <unk> , all of the other in other condition , in very different states .
and i started with <unk> <unk> , which is the future <unk> and <unk> , who was my friend and colleague , and i got to work with music music , and i was playing a different song , for example , i could be a different school , for example , i could be <unk> , for example ,
we 've done the <unk> <unk> , so , of course , of the <unk> of the <unk> , months , months .
and this <unk> , which is really from the people .
it was my destiny , i was studying november november for my <unk> , and i did n't have to do it with the wall , that the wall was dark .
i woke up the next day , i had a college , oh , the wall , yes , yes .
and so i 've got a little bit quickly , for any questions , you know , too .
and by the time i was <unk> for the cities in the <unk> .
and there 's a interaction of how interactions are related to each other , between two german cultures .
in fact , we talk to the same language that 's going to be beautiful and became wonderful , but a lot of it was <unk> .
unlike the <unk> , it did n't get all of the people themselves , but it came up a lot of up , and that 's what i 've been looking at the side of the german , and then i would look at the german identity , and then i got back to it , and then i got back to the german , and the german <unk>
since , germany is <unk> .
and the more than the <unk> of the <unk> are more than a lot more <unk> cities .
and that 's interaction , but i 've learned all things , and i had food in the city .
we have a <unk> , by the way , you 've got a <unk> , imagine that when i started here , <unk> , stood up in culture and play .
i still have the same .
so , you know , for example , for <unk> , you did n't want to write <unk> and <unk> .
and i was the first director of the <unk> .
so i 'm not so much so much so much so much so much so much , but that was wonderful , that i had this <unk> , but she would go , but she would be soon , and then it would be soon , because i was going to be in education , and then it could be involved in education and make alliances to education and make alliances .
we 've done a lot of the urban <unk> , we 've only have this <unk> of the <unk> between the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , which we 've been designing with this <unk> between the world and architecture to the blue stones .
many , many interactions , we could create , and i could create , and i 've experienced , and we 've got to have , and we 've got to find what that means when different people are tracking different parts together .
and you know , by the way , i 'm always <unk> of the art of art , more and more and more and more and more of the culture , which is the <unk> between people , between cultures , and i 'll get around the way , and i 'll be back , and i 'll come back to the arts .
interaction was also a story between the <unk> , and we got to <unk> , seven , seven <unk> , seven <unk> , the idea of january january , the <unk> , the <unk> could be in the <unk> of the <unk> .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter has been invented , and the headline is ,
this word has two meanings , and i 'm looking at something that i have to have something , so i can also use it , and i can also use it as a verb , and say , i mean , i 'm going to know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i 'm going to <unk> you or the community .
and i 'm <unk> with something when i 'm going to talk to me and say , i 'm listening to me to identify with me .
and that 's a very big action .
five point three million people are trying to move , <unk> cities , to identify the double effect , to <unk> and recognize that you are a community in europe .
when big , we called <unk> , but anyway , as a community of many people who are in a big <unk> lives , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , in fact , this is the <unk> , and that was our key to <unk> the led to the people and of course of them , of course , of course ,
and the signs of the highway , the highway , many times .
a experience of the <unk> did n't have been able to find out so many people .
and so , with <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , working on <unk> , from <unk> , from <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> students from a <unk> school , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , `` my <unk> , '' home , `` my friends wrote .
and it was a particular effect that young girl quoted from boys and boy then letters that , and then they letters that letters from young men in something like this .
and there 's one of these young men in the piano , and playing this <unk> , which i loved that loved .
and , and she says , he quoted from a letter , and he said , `` i wrote a letter , he wrote him home , and he wrote him home , and i wrote him home , and i wrote him home , and i wrote him home , and i was playing with a young german , and i could never play a <unk> , because my two fingers are just <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger with a <unk> , and he tried to put himself in a friday <unk> in a <unk> , and tried to play the <unk> .
and it did n't have him .
it was so a <unk> scene that i was going to jump up , said , what did we learn ?
we 've learned to the <unk> , which is that many people can move together , but we 've learned that we have to learn <unk> years ago , and we 've taught us more and the culture of us , because we 're not going to be able to be different languages .
and this was a wonderful experience , and you see it 's not just about to know something .
it 's always learning to experience and get to win a lot .
and if we invent a lot of inventing and invention , if we 're going to make it all of art and culture , our own position to work with the conversation with our own identity , by the conversation with art and culture , then we 've got all
and i hope you 're still going to have a lot of <unk> and <unk> , from which they make this asset .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think we 're waiting for the first picture .
so i 've got to support the support of my canopy , so i have a few slides here .
but it 's not a scientific slides , but it 's going to my <unk> , and i 'm going to find a direction , and i think , and a way of the way i think , and i think that 's the next topic i think that 's going to be much more engaged .
now , by the <unk> words , i finally know , thank you , thank you very much for a lot of , so much , i think , and i think , in the realm of a field , we can be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> .
and then i had heard that you should be able to think you should be able to say , if somehow , if you look at the talk , but if you look at this , you would n't see what i wanted to say , `` i would say , `` so i did n't know , so i did n't know , and so i was able to say , `` so i was going to say , so i was going to say , and so i was going to go to the talk , and so i left
how we 're going to die .
i have to tell you at the first time .
<unk> was in the hospital i was <unk> the <unk> , and she was <unk> .
she was over <unk> years old , and she was like to be dancing , because she was too much of her husband who was like the first man who was in war .
and so you 're going to be a first year , and then , long , and then , then , then , then a <unk> <unk> , and then it 's <unk> and then , and then , on the right side , you see the leg cracked , the <unk> .
and a few years before , she was also <unk> and had a same way , and i had broken the same story , already the left leg .
and then i was also there in the doctor , and i 've experienced a doctor , and i was a doctor in the intensive care of the intensive care , and was being treated with all of the <unk> in the public in the age of all of the age of the cancer , and i was able to get the conversation in the world 's discussion , and that 's what it was in the way that it was in the way that it was ?
does it make sense of a way to make a <unk> of the <unk> of these <unk> of the work ?
so , in order , to <unk> , in intensive weeks , is that a person at all of it ?
and she was born , and she was cured .
five years later , i get in the clinic , i see the name , and i can remember , and i 've forgotten good at the time because he 's just so much for the time , and the dance was actually broken in the may , and he broke the other leg .
so the question is , what is i doing , what 's what i actually do , if i 'm talking about how a person to choose what he 's going to say , `` what he 's going to write in a steady nurse or what he 's going to do ?
and this is a little bit of the subject of the <unk> .
you see here , you see the <unk> of the called <unk> .
it 's a book from <unk> , like we 're going to work , a report on the <unk> .
and then it was so that the globalization was so much more , so that 's a very strong thing that you have to ask , and they go to work with , and they go to work with you .
you then have , and you can see this book , and i 'd like to read it , just to say , `` you 'll get a quality quality , so that the parts are always going to get .
it 's going to be a refined machine that 's going to be a constant marker , it 's also going to be a lot more stronger , for example , that was a big subject .
and that 's also that basically , basically the work of the individual , so something that has been a <unk> , and more <unk> , that he was always <unk> and also <unk> stronger the quality of quality , which is
and that , when i think , people have less than less self-confidence , and more part of a little <unk> , where it was about , and not to get more high levels , and not to define their work .
and if we 're going to transmit this now in the <unk> and medical range , there 's something that 's right now .
when you hear in television , what doctors and caregivers and also <unk> , and also the most vulnerable , it 's called the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when you have to get bored , what you 've done , is it 's going to be paid for it , and if not prepared it , and if not prepared it , then the medical service is just to do , and we do n't pay for the health care .
and through this documentary , but the work is more powerful , and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
a good friend of mine was now to be now , because he did n't want this to be more mature , who had a <unk> practice , has finally <unk> and she went to the <unk> doctor .
the <unk> are mostly in these systems , and he had the martin , who had been experiencing that , and they had more old people to go around the <unk> , and back , because the <unk> would not have more than the people who do n't have worse .
then the hospital is , will be a <unk> , go back to the <unk> , or <unk> , and they 're going to continue there .
and this family was really thinking , if there 's a little bit more difficult to be a bit more relevant in holland , i want to make a <unk> to run this <unk> of the <unk> and also <unk> <unk> from people .
now , in the way , in the netherlands , he had to find out , after he had learned the language with a lot of hard , that 's exactly what happened in this <unk> .
it 's also being introduced to each other quality .
it 's not more the credibility that counts , but you find a <unk> in one available , i want to be in the hospital , or not in the hospital , if i am in the hospital .
and then the <unk> is .
in holland , it 's so , in the third days , a conversation is going to find a conversation with the pride and then you have to put in the hospital , and i want to be in the hospital or i do n't want to be in the hospital if i want to happen to me .
that 's the same thing that i want to be in , i want to be in terms of or i want to be an <unk> .
and this data then then is a central and there 's this doctor 's <unk> , and then there 's the <unk> of the <unk> , and then then the decision is going to be the decision to this site .
now , if we look at <unk> , which is really happy to be a dance and even more and then , and we imagine , who would have a <unk> account , i would n't want to be an accident , i would n't want to be an accident , i would have to be able to be a <unk> dance , where they would be <unk> , and then
and that 's the friend 's now , which is sitting there in holland , too much more <unk> , as he 's about it .
in the last last , it 's so <unk> today is about <unk> percent of people dying of people , but in hospitals , that 's the <unk> , which is the possible habitat for a lot of <unk> , but it 's often a very tightly sticker that 's often <unk> , and it 's often a lot of <unk> in the world , and in the way that 's a lot of success , and for the point of
there 's a little bit of living , which is very good at that , there 's very <unk> people who are looking at , but if i look at some of the <unk> patients , so we have about <unk> , which might be <unk> , and that 's how to say , it 's very difficult to be <unk> , and it 's going to be a hard time , and it 's very hard to be
and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , this is quite clear , which is quite clear , which is all the <unk> quality , which is not only imagine that all of the money is not going to be able to be able to be <unk> and have paid people who are going to say ,
this is not just the reality , but you need two salaries in the <unk> and <unk> and most of it , and most of it 's just a little bit of .
these introduction of quality as an <unk> marketplace , which you want to regulate , so , so , the individuals are actually going to be done in the individuals .
and now i 'm going to get out how to escape , so what do we do now in the last , because i 've got to ask questions , and demonstrated that , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
and there 's just the <unk> <unk> and the article one of me , because i think that 's always a society , also , the <unk> structures , which is the whole structure that we have to be the whole thing that happens in our society .
and in the <unk> article is , one is , the person 's <unk> is <unk> .
and the second sentence there is , they 're <unk> , is the <unk> to all the <unk> .
and what i 'm not missing is a third sentence in which , that 's one of us , that 's all of the individual should have the assignment for the order to protect its dignity and defend .
because that 's a way of <unk> from this case , i 'll give you other way , and i 'll give me some of them in the way of a way of and then i 'm not going to give me a way of and provide me to how to do it , and then i do n't have to do it from the way of how to do it , and then i do n't have to do it , and then i do n't have to do it , and then i do n't have to do it , and then i do n't have to do that because i 'll be going to die .
because the last thing is , though , when we do n't like to do this subject , we 're going to come to the point of the point .
hopefully it 's not late , and it 's hopefully a hundred or <unk> .
and that 's also a job , of course , i have to say , and i want to say , and i want to be a lot of people , but i want to ask you for the subject , but if it 's a little bit of , if you might be a long time , or , if it 's a little bit of <unk> or <unk> , and i 'm going to be a little bit of late in life , i want to be a little bit more than thinking about it .
now , if you think about what 's doing what 's doing my life , then you 'll come on the next step , which is the five most important things in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is quite a <unk> <unk> .
and there 's the self-esteem , of course , it 's the friends i 've got to talk to me and exchange me , and i think that 's the lives of the life and the <unk> of life , it 's the <unk> .
it 's safe between people who i might have to do with , in the <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , or another person , with the relationship with the relationship .
and there are many individual factors of course , which is there , i do n't go through .
but if you look at these three points , you 've already have a whole bunch of tasks , how you have to have a lot of life , to protect the last one in the last one would be .
and then another factor is that we have a certain cause of the <unk> of the <unk> , i 've got this one as a text as a text and as a text .
other people can have these decisions for us and behavior , which is not going to get .
this is my inner conviction .
our dignity can only get us from ourselves .
so it 's not the question , because other people are doing , who will be who will be , for me , for me , for me , or for me , for me , who are in me , or for me , who are , for me , who are going to me ?
it 's exactly the other way , to ask , where can i be in people , where i could do things , and my inner inside of it would be involved in the way that i could deal with these questions , and i can handle it there and the way that i could .
and when you 're saying , so , when we 're going to work , so these inner quality , it was to say that it was a way to say , i was looking at my inner inner <unk> , of the mechanism in the way .
because no person can me give me to me , how i want to see myself and the way to see .
and i do n't have to put in a <unk> <unk> or opinions who say you 've got to put it in a steady point , and because you 're so old , i think you 're in a intensive care .
these questions that can probably be a long time in the last 10 , probably in a long period of <unk> , probably <unk> .
these would be a inner stance of the people who can be in me , and that can be <unk> by the outside of the outside , including the government , which is not the law and also more people who have me to have me to be in the ones that i have before , so i could have to have a person who have been
and to make these conversations , it 's going to have spaces , and i think , and so , i 've called this talk , and so there 's a spaces that 's been a conversation like this , which is a conversation where we have to think about how to be the things that 's not a conversation that it 's not to be a conversation that 's not
so if we 're old , if you 're old , you can say , `` well , '' a dance is very much old , and i think , very high age , that would be a little bit of .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful nice evening .
i 'll get two things with .
when you 're flat to flat , you 're a little bit more precise .
it 's a second .
let 's start with infinite vision .
this is stupid , not , you can take .
what do you mean ?
are there different kinds of <unk> ?
or is it infinitely enough ?
yeah .
that 's not good when there 's one of this one , which is what 's going .
so , in fact , but i 'll have it , for the ones who know it .
that 's what we do n't do .
we 're just looking at a single one .
and i also <unk> to a little bit more .
<unk> , we know , make infinite infinite form , we 're looking at a way .
and it 's for the <unk> of the magnitude of scale .
when we 're in the top , and you count two <unk> in the other hand , in the other people .
we know , now , now , we 're looking at now , we 're looking at the box , which is tiny , it 's three chairs and it 's three people .
we can check whether in every amount of a lot of the same number of elements in there ?
is how would we do it ?
that 's what we would be just to <unk> people , one , two , we 're going to get the chairs , we 're looking at three chairs , one , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three
that 's what you mean , yes ?
very nice .
this works in the <unk> wonderful , it 's also done in big numbers , although it 's <unk> .
but it fits .
how can you have a direct impact ?
how can you get in the rain point that are so many people like chairs ?
i 've got out of chairs and people and not what else .
yay !
you call it , you call the mate !
you know , you know , that 's not , not , we 're in the day , and we 're all the way that all the day is .
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , it 's called <unk> a <unk> and it works just the same , yes ?
you take a chair , you put it from a chair from the mouse .
the next <unk> , the next <unk> , everything is , everything is a lot of , different chairs , no chair , and a little bit of a lot of big , okay ?
now we 're going to go into infinity .
how can we be two infinite tips ?
we would say that 's a big or bigger or bigger than the other .
we could do it ?
we would start to begin .
and that 's what it 's wrong , because the point is , when you 're going to count in a infinite long , yes , i would say , you do n't get to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , is that <unk> ?
so , how do it go ?
<unk> ?
no way , <unk> !
she was just going to begin .
mate !
so , now , let 's look at this .
estimate , you appreciate that is bad , yes , right ?
you see you , yeah , you see , you do n't see , yes , yes ?
the point is , you know , you 're going to do it all .
if i take a <unk> , natural figures , <unk> , we need computers , we need to have the zero , zero , one , two , four , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five
and we would say , let 's say , `` one , a replica of this <unk> and take a little bit of these <unk> , the infinitely <unk> numbers .
left , the numbers are , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinitely long band of the natural <unk> , but on the one band are missing the <unk> , on the other are the straight and the <unk> , okay ?
let 's call the one of the <unk> of the linear numbers , we call the other amount of n the natural numbers .
what do you believe ?
is grams of <unk> , is it bigger than n , or tiny , tiny ?
right ?
but that 's very soon , yeah , you know , is a lack of <unk> .
who are another estimate ?
little bit ?
who is getting bigger ?
ah , who really did n't really do n't really plan , yes ?
that 's not true , yes ?
you ca n't , where what 's missing , it 's not , not , that 's not , `` do n't ?
okay , you say , little bit of a little bit more ?
would you guess ?
this is the popular thing you 're looking at , of course , is wrong .
and now , now , i 'm explaining why the crowd are .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the linear <unk> , we take the zero from the natural amount of , they get out .
the next of the zero , after two , two , after the zero comes one , and i 'll get a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the eight , the four , yes ?
you can turn it into the way , it 's doubling that 's obvious , <unk> ?
and completely clear , by the <unk> , we create it that i 'm going to do it in the conversation that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and here is , there 's just the straight on the straight on the upper and the band is in the same for a long , yes ?
we <unk> the natural on the linear , <unk> , which are still gone , and that 's still still right .
that 's just in infinite .
so if you 're going to explain some of what we 've learned today , even get infinity , yeah , what is the infinite thing , i know ?
a infinite set has a quality of a quality , which is not in the <unk> , and this trait is , is absolute <unk> , a real subset of a <unk> .
and you ca n't do it in a <unk> , if you put three three people , then it 's just one there and before they were three .
yes , we did get infinity .
none of them is not a <unk> ?
okay .
then we do one second part of a probability .
the professionals , there 's a certain amount of probability .
so , here 's what i 'm going to do .
and in this experiment , i 'm sure , is you sure , it 's at least one third , and you know , it 's a person who does someone who has on it ?
so , let 's call the doors , b , c .
i 've got behind something , i hope you 've never heard .
and you 're supposed to have a very much guess .
where my mind , i have a little bit hidden , behind a , b or c ?
guess what we have here , our <unk> , here .
they estimate c .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has a idea ?
no , <unk> , b , not , otherwise , you know , stop , `` yes ? ''
so right .
it 's really not all right , so you do n't have to be my , three letters , and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really not anyway , yes ?
it 's completely clear because , because , the chance you have , is that it 's very lucky , it 's just in a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really no matter , yes ?
now , here 's what i 'm doing is , i just do one .
well , i know , of course , where it 's .
<unk> , this has someone who 's <unk> .
so , i know where it 's , and guess what , and guess what , or that 's what you call it is , is going to be a second round .
so i 'm really proud of the game i 'm going to tell you now , i 'm just going to be just <unk> .
so , it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , now , i suppose i was looking at a , <unk> ?
so , i have to show you a door , behind it 's not behind it , and they did n't say .
because if you say b , and i say , and i know it 's not behind b .
there would n't have a second round .
and then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , good luck .
but i have to have a <unk> , which is <unk> , in the second round .
so i can just give a open , behind it 's not only is n't , but what you did n't have told .
now , the question is , and that 's the kind of probability of the condition , under the condition , under the condition , under the condition , that is that b is open , and it 's not behind , you have to have their last chance to guess what it is now .
you can not stay in a stay , i 'm really excited .
i 'm going to do what you want .
or you say , i do c .
now the <unk> is now going to have to have more likely ?
protocell , very nice , b is on , i know it 's behind c .
or , but , but , god is that b is being open , i always wanted to stay in a stay .
or if you 're going to say , but it 's <unk> , we have <unk> , path , we have two doors , it 's no way to change or remain .
what do you mean ?
it 's not anyway .
<unk> .
why is n't it anyway ?
very nice .
why is it <unk> ?
yes , that 's what it 's wrong .
that 's all of it , when we had the <unk> <unk> ?
but so they are , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , so , the thing that is quite <unk> , yes .
and all of these things , i all understand , do n't know , six and , yes , i ca n't get to <unk> , otherwise i ca n't come from the way , `` it 's wrong ? ''
so there 's really all of everyone .
behind this door , it 's a third .
and it 's always just a third behind a door .
you can do what you want to have , you have two thirds of the <unk> .
so , you have , you could have to guess what you could have on two doors , not , you ca n't do with a <unk> , you can do in two dozen , you can have , yes , it 's <unk> , if you do n't have the zero to the zero , which is all right in the right life .
but here we have a door .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , the answer is , two thirds is not what you do .
so the two third here is , but it can only be behind one door !
it 's not behind .
so what is you more likely ?
no way i really have , i really hid .
so , what is more likely to do ?
it 's better to remain , to get it or move ?
now it 's easy , right ?
yes , of course .
so , that was n't hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what do we see ?
they were <unk> .
why ?
just simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for each one .
thank you .
mr. <unk> , she was <unk> <unk> <unk> who 's just a bad diet , and bad food and overweight people , and poor people who have been <unk> a sudden ,
but i 'm betting my best , that 's all the time , this game is .
i 'm coming from <unk> farm and knew until i was 12 , not mcdonald 's suffering .
that 's all the way , right .
yeah .
thank you for inviting us .
i grew up to the one of the morning .
and i do n't know if mr. <unk> was so on the answer , if i want to talk to the ted in the lake , and talk about a particular particular .
i 've got to trust a lot of <unk> : the subject .
now , motivation , motivation is not bad and i <unk> me the woman who said , maybe maybe one or other or other sports later .
and that 's what i have to have a whole .
so tonight is now going to walk the morning and you 're going to have a lot of <unk> , but i have to go to <unk> , because i 'm going to go in three weeks at the <unk> june , <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and that 's <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm going to be a day in the rain that the training is not going to be <unk> .
so who wants to go , <unk> , tomorrow 's day , in the <unk> , i 'm going to be a lot of all .
i 've got to say , briefly , i 'm betting my trust story .
and i started to have extra , you know , <unk> , with the subject .
not worry , the nice , little <unk> , blind , <unk> , <unk> .
i was done before i made it in a little bit of thinking , when i 'm <unk> , how i 'm going to be like , how i am in the best where i 'm going to ?
so , i come from a half houses , i 'm on six houses , many <unk> , some <unk> and a few <unk> and in my parents , is apple apples , and what you do from <unk> , and beer .
trust , in sports , of course , not in the <unk> , but it 's not in me , and beer and beer .
why do i tell you the story where i am ?
for me , one of the most important stories that i really have been so right , from the country , from the village , and grew up there with two great brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> brother .
and with the second brother , the same way i 'm blind is how i am .
so , who looks a bright and dark , which can see how i just see where <unk> windows in the room , whether it 's light or out .
so what 's very practical is for the <unk> .
and we both see , you can see , you can see , you can see , you can see , if you see something like something .
<unk> are <unk> , but i always say , `` i ca n't hear a <unk> man 's name .
for the subject of the old men , <unk> .
and it 's always going to come up .
and what 's really important is , but what was really important is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , is the fact , just as a great trust , and you can see this big trust , which is that we need to have a lot of <unk> , i 'll tell you .
and that was not my parents , and that 's all of them , you know , like many of you , my brother , and i did n't know the blind .
we were so the first one that are relatively part of the lives in your life .
and then they had to do anything from the situation .
and now i 'm going to be a lot of happiness that my parents are not a whole day , and not to provide time and say , and to give us to us , and say , there 's a wall , there 's the <unk> wall , and then you get out to your hand , and you can feel like you can feel like you , and you can feel like you .
a would have been uncomfortable -- we have fallen on home .
and b <unk> , our parents from us to go to the beginning of where we were , and our <unk> brother is .
so , in the house alone , the <unk> and <unk> , they risk .
there 's the blind brother i put in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> the <unk> , i still have to talk .
this is the great brothers -- they 're not just good for the elbow , but also the <unk> .
and our brothers and my brothers and my brothers and i was <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , which is what we could do , in the answer to the bike .
and this has the <unk> brother , and the desire with <unk> , and we wanted to have , and of course , i wanted to -- michael and i was .
and then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , they started to drive with <unk> , like many little kids , today , the <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
until the <unk> , the <unk> .
but we 've started this with <unk> , eventually , at a little bit of <unk> ,
and then the big question is : how does n't we think ?
and how do you do that , one of the faith , the faith of parents , that the kids also in the end of the bike , and they 're going to fall back in the bike , and the people in the <unk> and the people from us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us and the trust of us , and the people of us , and the trust of us , and the trust of us , and the trust of us , that 's the trust of us , and the trust of us that we do n't be permanently .
and our answer was that we have a <unk> of our parents have us tell us where are the <unk> , so where the car <unk> , where things , are , you know , there 's no longer things -- and so we did n't have it , and so we knew it
and we had to employ in between in between in between the way , but the one of the other people also know the other hand , but the other way .
and that 's why you ca n't find all of these things in the moment , because it 's going to be there , that you do n't have anything more of it .
but <unk> ' night , when you 're going to light up , and in your bedroom , or in whose bedroom , they 're always liked to be able to respond .
you can try and just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , and they 're going to find that , in us , they 're also like these people as we do , you 'll hear a opposition .
so as bats are so <unk> that they 're going to hear about , and they 're listening to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the sound of the sound is going to be different kind of <unk> .
and that 's for me , so i think , in the movement , also , the movement has been important in the movement .
but the <unk> of the high school , and the security is , i have to help me to help me to help me be a little bit of <unk> .
and i just like to manage to manage to manage to be able to manage a big trouble and clear , and there 's no other accidents , which is one or of another one .
now , what i 'm not doing now is n't a <unk> of all , which i 'm very <unk> in which is a very <unk> of one of our most of our <unk> also .
and that 's the end of the ocean , on the higher building on the lower building on the streets .
i wrote a written in the <unk> , and i grew up with a <unk> diversity .
and i 've already very literally , because i was a person who has been too much more and in the <unk> in the science of the science , and i 've never had a <unk> of it , or am i never seen this picture of the <unk> .
i could never read the same time in the same .
but certainly , also , is that there 's no one of all of us not experience that in which of any of the <unk> , of course .
diversity is in the way of the way of our strength with the <unk> , to know where i am good , what i 'm doing , which is i doing , which i 'm doing , and where can my strength really have been a full of <unk> ?
and our brother only again , the <unk> and i 've always took michael and me and me and took me out of roofs from the house .
so then , then , okay , we <unk> a <unk> .
there 's a place where you can get away from a self-driving <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> went to <unk> , michael and i 've got a little bit more like the girl 's girl : `` <unk> , <unk> , i do n't .
but then , after the end , who is going to be there in the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think the other thing , the other thing , we 're the generation of young women , not .
and from the way , i 'm still going to go .
and then , the consequence was that we were at all three <unk> <unk> , and he was n't going to be <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and not even know what he 's supposed to say .
because , of course , is , of course , is , of course , if other challenges .
so the father were said , to be said , to god , help help help be a lot of the danger of us have been <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't know .
but is n't that happened .
he had to be <unk> that he had just <unk> and <unk> <unk> , who has been <unk> and then <unk> us .
and that 's what i found for me , that we had this opportunities .
but , yeah , no concern is not a requirement , no effective , to make a little bit later .
for me , the different sports who were important in my life , all , is interesting .
and all of all , they all were all of all , because i could see , where did i see my boundaries , what are my <unk> .
so <unk> good <unk> would have never ever be ever .
i never had the <unk> .
and i do n't go to it to <unk> .
i 'm going to go out of rain .
now , not at five level , you know , right now .
and in <unk> rain -- but still rather than inside .
but i always have this trust in my own , i discovered that i tried to try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try .
first to the first one , for example .
and that was very beautiful , because there 's the coach who had been in the <unk> , '' he said , ok , we have a louder <unk> kids , but send back to the <unk> of the blind children .
it 's good , because you 're playing with each other , you 're going to get you on the heel .
and then you realize what the other power is .
and there was my great trust , of course , if i 'll leave the competition for a long time , it 's hard to be difficult , but then the other might make what i do n't .
so there 's one method , and that 's the trust in my speed .
the other <unk> put a foot in the <unk> , let me go backwards itself , the <unk> head throw out , and then he 's got over and competition is over .
i 'm not going to try to get it .
i was thinking about it , but i had <unk> .
i think that 's now a little bit more boring .
and that 's no volunteers now , right ?
<unk> .
crap , i 'm betting .
okay .
the next one for me , is a sports , and then , the <unk> , then , the <unk> and the <unk> .
my parents were home , or they 're <unk> , and they taught us as children as children .
but for me , in school , i think , in school , how can i get to school for school , to get to get my excess energy ?
and there was a way of being a way to do as a way to school .
and even i 've always thought that , this is all <unk> boring , because it 's more like that 's <unk> , i 'm going to be more like that , i 'm going to be more like the <unk> , i 'm going to be <unk> .
i found that in the way , i do n't have a little bit more .
i 've got to have said , well , i do with <unk> .
and then , the first thing , you 've realized , man , again , this is the great diversity of the sport , because you need to have a lot of good , you need to make a good good , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> -- you have probably going to have been a lot of work in their work ?
this is the same thing in the <unk> .
you 'll just get up , if you just do this full trust in your own technology .
when you do that trust in your own power -- so the power , you also have the same conditions , the bad weather , the soft snow , the <unk> snow .
and when you do n't trust in my case , you know , in the team .
because the <unk> , which is nothing , of course , of course , of course , <unk> <unk> .
and i never had something that 's happening as a result , i 'm going to use that -- i have to use the word -- my <unk> -- there 's only one -- now i 've done this .
but nothing , we 're still going to do it again .
and i 'm just going to be a little bit of it , maybe it 's just a minute .
and with one , one of you , one of them later , one of them would give you another exercise .
so what i do is to do with the subject of trust , which is the exercise that i 'm going to do the audience just like the audience just like it is so like , if you do n't see anything , to make a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : you have two sticks in the hand .
so , from the way , i do n't get a hand , and i could n't take a hand , and i could take my dutch <unk> and put them out .
do n't .
so i need to help me .
i then put my <unk> in front of me .
and the message to me is the voice .
so , the same thing that is to make a little bit of <unk> .
and also , it 's important for trust .
the obvious thing in communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> says me , i always tell me , when it 's <unk> , '' which says , `` <unk> , '' which says , `` on the left , i know it , so i stopped looking at the top of the <unk> .
when he says , on the left , on the left , left to left , and when he says , right ?
okay , all the idea of this ?
and then <unk> problem , because i need to do it again , or he has to do , or he has to correct me , then i know , `` well , what 's not . ''
and for me , i 'm very big , critical , most important , if the <unk> of me , i have to get a very <unk> <unk> to say it .
to say , it 's a positive idea , it 's for me to me , it 's for me , the tools that it allows me to be just at just quickly and also be fast , and also , too , as well , it 's going to go faster than others , which is going to go faster in the same competition .
and that can only do when i 'm going to do it , with two poor , i 'm going to stand up , and i have to make a look at the way to make the eyes -- ha , or you can open up and can open up .
and then you have to have so <unk> and then you have to get back to the other leg and just like this , and you can actually get a little bit more precise , but really , really , to be quite quiet .
also , high , you know .
yes , and that 's the key thing , i mean , this is all the most important thing when i 'm going to say , like i 'm saying , i say , `` i 'm just telling you , and i actually say , `` hey , you have to say , `` you do n't have to say , `` hey , you 've got to make the right <unk> , because the answer , the answer , because it 's obvious , because it 's obvious , because it 's obvious , because it 's obvious , because it 's obvious ,
so , you know , it 's not what he must say .
so i 'm a one that has to be opening up to communication .
and that 's like a <unk> .
if someone does n't know my needs , of course , of course , he ca n't help me , but i have to ask me , and i have to say , well , well , i need to have a practice from you , maybe the curve might be <unk> .
or i need to have a practice of you like the <unk> , you know , that 's the mountain , because if we 're going to get the <unk> , there 's the <unk> thing , and you have to be over .
and again , it 's done in a way , and the thing is not listening to .
and then i also have a <unk> , which is a <unk> , you know , at <unk> , who i told me , unfortunately , we would have just a few minutes behind us , because we took out , so we just got a <unk> , and then you 'll wait for a little bit of <unk> , and then you wait for a while .
so , this is why it 's important to have the idea of <unk> , which is impressive <unk> .
i hear about <unk> -- there 's another thing that are also going to drive <unk> <unk> ?
who is more ?
so my best time has been faster , but now , in april , i 've never been <unk> in the age of , i 've never been saying , too much faster , how <unk> <unk> .
and in the moment of the moment , <unk> .
and for me , how said , these are the kind of <unk> , only if i just get my ears , ''
but the other one i 'm telling me what he looks like to see and i have a way to give me a way , my risks , is perfect .
and that 's one of the most important things that i say , is , trust is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is , is not more training and not this <unk> .
so , even in the blind , not as a blind , is honest , from the <unk> .
because i 've also had the experience that i had a <unk> on the right and left wrong with the left .
and then this was bad at the competition because it 's next to the way of three feet .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
so , as i said , `` well , this was , of course , '' of course , <unk> .
and i know , i know , i know , because the <unk> are to turn up , so you have to turn out of <unk> .
and i 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be in the right now , that people say , on the left and say , `` oh , the other left .
so , then , there was the right , sadly .
it 's not a lot of life in the ground .
but , very , in <unk> situation , you know , you know , you probably know all of the work , or the college are still going to go up and still have to go .
and then , of course , obviously , is very obvious , very much more difficult challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` well , '' is that the trust trust is all the risks to know .
and i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to be honest , i 'm like someone who ca n't see , relatively large in the advantage , because i 'm betting my risks in many ways .
so , i 'm now all the <unk> .
the drive of the nest maintenance workers , from falling down , which is <unk> , which i know , but i 'm <unk> , but that 's the important thing -- i 'm also <unk> the good pages .
and then , the thing is , if you can get there , if that 's the trust , you know .
and when you find somebody who 's really a hundred percent of the <unk> , how i need it .
and with all , i 've got the same goals .
because this is the next thing to trust me , very important .
you need the same goal , and i have to see , really , really , just what is really , to take it ,
because of it 's often <unk> , the way you use .
i trust the phone or the or myself .
but that 's what the very key thing is , is that it 's a lot of hangs .
you know , you 're not much more intuitive to trust .
and that you also -- because we 're having people to get <unk> with <unk> <unk> -- we want to see <unk> sense .
and the sense that 's really often is often that we can also create , <unk> goal together .
that 's what we do -- in my case , from some , i 've got a little bit of a couple weeks .
and there 's the same thing i 'm going to do : i have to look at anybody to be , or i can trust that case , that i can get that mountain up .
and how do you do that in the mountain , you have a really top thing in a lot of thing ?
well , i 've got sure , of course , of course , of course , i 've got a big advantage , i did n't get out of the other things , if it 's next to me to be a hundred feet .
and then i was relatively <unk> .
can be a advantage of the advantage , fear is not a problem .
and i 've been working with fear and more than the <unk> , now of the <unk> , i 've been <unk> and then i flew with <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
now , this is a little bit more precise , when you look at the bottom , and then you hear the cars , you know , you do n't have to see a lot of it , you know , it 's not going to go to there , if i 'm going to get a <unk> .
and these things are always interesting for me .
but also , also , the <unk> , but i just know , `` hey , i think , `` hey , i think i 'm looking at it so yes , and you can just focus on it but just as a result of this .
and that 's the <unk> <unk> <unk> , because of <unk> <unk> , you know , you 're going to go to the day , you 're just 10 hours , and it 's just going to just come just .
you 're going to go and go , it 's just stones around , still less plants .
you take a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and you 've got in the first time of war ii .
so if you see <unk> de <unk> , the <unk> of the last , the <unk> .
the thing that 's the first exciting thing .
we 've seen the <unk> only from the distance or the other .
so i 'm <unk> , so i 've got a lot of trust in the <unk> -- despite the <unk> <unk> , who had it .
because i thought , `` well , i 've probably <unk> out of the way , so , to go faster , how to have the thing .
but as i said , it 's otherwise quite <unk> , because you 're not going to be a lot of change in the right now .
and really exciting is , then , when you will be something hard to be .
so when you go to the height and the air is thinner .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , when you put a little bit of <unk> , where it 's on the left and on the right .
and then it 's too beautiful and then when it 's night , and all of the <unk> , and then , at us , it 's like the <unk> , and then he would say , `` now he would like me to get the rope in the way and has been in the handle .
because i was like , and i was just <unk> with no one <unk> , and then it was too risky .
and i 've created that , we 've been done by this , that i 've been said , well , well , i can say , of course , of my mother , my friend , my friend , which was , i think , `` a hundred percent , '' i 'm going to be done in a hundred .
but i also need to make a <unk> form of security , so i do n't have to focus on because , you can imagine , you know , if you imagine , if you 're going to tell you to the mountain all the mountain on the right , right on the right , on the left on the left on the right , on the left on the left on the right .
there 's where you get in a little bit , and you all have .
so for us , for us , we 've been trust in the case , we 're looking for <unk> connection , so we got a rope on your backpack , which had me in the hand , and then i ran out behind her , and then then ran behind her , and then
in the other <unk> , i had i had a little bit of the <unk> .
and she 's just going to end up with the foot , and she 's <unk> , and she was <unk> with her <unk> <unk> , that i 've ever knew what i knew so on the same way , and not in me to be in the way that i had to focus on .
and what i 've shown all of this just is how beautiful it 's actually , of course , you see , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , then you see , you see , then you see , you see , then you see , you see , then you see , you see , then you see , you see , then you see , you see , then you get up to the top of the top , that you 're really going to get this goal in a level of the <unk> , like the <unk> .
but the other hand , it 's also that i 've forgotten , that trust is that i 'm just to me , that is the case of my job , if i really have the top of the goal , ''
but it 's the trust , it 's also true to other people who are the privilege of poverty , how trust is , it 's how trust works .
and when we 're <unk> at night , we were in the group , we were in the group , and so the other seven governments were left and the other seven and i 've got to go and have been looking at all of the <unk> and i 've thought , `` tell me , and tell you , why you see , because everyone else , and
you can not look at the boys in the back .
it 's kind of not the reason .
and then i realized , ah , yeah , yeah , which is , you know , you know , that trust is actually a lot of <unk> in their ability .
you 're going to go through the dark , you go to 12 o'clock in the morning , then there 's no light .
this is completely <unk> , when you 're <unk> , the air is a thin , so , it 's just more and not just more and so far more and now , it 's not more <unk> .
and then there 's the moment where the wait for you , yes , that was actually completely <unk> , because the friend 's friend 's friends just is all of me , we 've always been <unk> -- how women are going to do .
have the whole night we tell us all of us and the other people in the group had just been there as the philosopher , <unk> , ok , it 's just <unk> 's <unk> hour , that 's what she told me .
or i did n't tell you what a mountain tells you .
and that 's what it 's still , there 's somebody there , perhaps there 's bad at all , perhaps we have been talking about it , maybe we 've just talked about it , it 's just more than a half hour , the sun is going to go on .
and that things that also , these things can be <unk> and can be safe and can be able to be very much higher and can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make it so much the personal gold box and then you can not have to be able to get it .
and for me , it 's all the wisdom of all , and then , all of all , if you 're going to be a personal gold box and what you want to do , then , then there 's actually the idea of the idea of the idea .
this is , of course , in sports , which is the gold , in the sport , i do n't know why the <unk> -- maybe i do n't know , to test value or looking at the value of the value ?
so i think that 's a few of the killing , it 's so <unk> , so that was a little bit of <unk> .
if that 's all real gold , i 'm not here , i would be on the <unk> , which i think .
or at least , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , the real thing i think you can imagine , is more , what i 'm doing is , i actually have created a kind of culture and how i focused on a point .
and as i did in my skills , but of course of the team that we need all , in studying , in which things are always .
anyway , as old man or young woman , we need people also , also , in the we trust .
and then , if we have this aim in the head , and then there 's the best proof of evidence that we could trust in a project in our lives .
and when you can be , it can be honest in other areas .
thank you very much .
science for me , this is the title of my talk , who evolved after <unk> , and she 's called <unk> .
what i 'm looking at me is the very <unk> effort that are <unk> the sciences again than a <unk> in the general population .
it 's basically being being being being happy .
when i 'm going to <unk> in a <unk> , there 's all <unk> to the literature for scientific topics , which is <unk> .
even every single <unk> , there 's a range of <unk> <unk> , magazines , <unk> , where scientific themes , are <unk> , things that are already been reflected in .
each <unk> call at least a <unk> , where somehow the scientific themes are processing .
even , that 's totally <unk> when you look at what it 's <unk> and <unk> for the kids with scientific subjects .
and every program has already been a own foot in the <unk> , but yet that 's a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that i can like to watch , but i want to read , but that 's not what that 's not true .
cool , cool is n't just a sort of science , in <unk> , somewhere , somewhere , there are the chemist , there 's cool , <unk> ?
so , as a <unk> , a <unk> five minutes , has nothing with the reality , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there 's where i can identify .
big bang <unk> , because i do it , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
this is extremely sad .
because that 's kind of paradox , which is a little paradox that will be just to deal with these problems with these problems of technology and issues .
but in the same time , nobody had no longer in oneself .
i 've got a few little bit of little examples of how science or science has been in us to have a place .
a very <unk> example : in london , you built a beautiful tower , <unk> , the architect , the architect , we 're just building this sort of <unk> .
what happens is what happens is now , the sun 's sunlight in the top of the facade , i got a <unk> error , which is a <unk> , and then then somewhere in another <unk> of a point .
this was a big deal by the press , unfortunately , unfortunately , a coral .
so the heat , the heat has so <unk> that poor poor , who has really long , long , there are the <unk> path .
and there 's a cartoon , so a architect , one of the architect , a way that 's not just like in physics because i mean , is really new , that 's a mirror , that 's a mirror .
so what i found is , very new , is <unk> , kind of <unk> in front of the christ , where he 's <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
so , i really wonder what has the more design or architect or what did he studied ?
now , this is a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is what else has such a few themes , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , this is now a few years ago , as a sort of thing that was in the media .
there was the train in <unk> , because <unk> changed , that was in a danger .
genes was a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
genes were kind of bad .
<unk> , oh , there are genes inside .
there were situations where there were in the market , there was really , you have a lot of things , hey , i have <unk> vegetables .
no idea what 's supposed to be , yes .
so , yeah , okay , the german tomatoes , we have a debate .
but the time i was in the lab , and i was really feeling really , because i tried to get these evil genes in my bacteria , this <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , and my <unk> neighbor , and my home neighbor , and my way of neighbor : <unk> , you see , but not , you see , but not happy , what is going on ?
i 'm like , yes , i 'm going to do so there for three days in my bacteria and not work in the way .
now , this was what i 've tried to explain , so somehow , a <unk> , genes , i thought , `` oh , good lady , if i talk about genes , you 've already know what they say .
so this was what i really meant to , so one sequence i wanted to get in this <unk> <unk> .
but that was what the woman has gone .
and this woman never was back to me .
who knows what i 'm doing , `` you know ?
genes is a bad thing .
now , this is good 10 years ago , and yet it 's kind of a lot of mind .
genes , that 's what bad .
i 've never read a long time .
and it 's still freely , and it 's a really <unk> in our language .
<unk> can be in europe , was a headline .
<unk> are different from other corn , yes , which is no genes in all .
another headline , <unk> , <unk> rats are dying earlier .
yes , that was a beautiful headline .
but those are not so old and it 's also quite not even more anyway , what are i available .
anyway , whether the time or the picture , all about <unk> .
luckily , it 's not going to be a <unk> in the <unk> , but i 'm afraid , and i 'm not going to do it .
but that 's what it looks like that uncertainty in the population , because they 're just not in the issues of the themes .
we have to have been able to have to have us in our future with these technologies .
now , just <unk> , nobody had the big on the subject , but it 's been going to be in things , and i 've got to have a lot of things that most of the most people have no idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
how is that information from the lab ?
if we suppose that little , young , young scientists , a experiment , a experiment , a experiment , <unk> something , beautiful and good , and he 's going to be good , and it 's what 's what 's really important .
then the first thing to go to the professor .
the boss , the boss , you do , you do n't want to go , okay , cool <unk> , and it 's going to be a <unk> <unk> in science , which is always important in science .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public , it 's a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> , oh , great idea , great , great , and we do a <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> with a project , a nice idea , and then that 's kind of coming out of the <unk> .
that 's what it 's going to do , but what are actually ?
now these studies are rarely alone , typically , have a shared <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all these , the <unk> , which is the right <unk> projects , then they gave up the <unk> , to the magazine , whether it 's <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
that 's the way .
and from the basis , it 's going to continue it further and <unk> , in the ground , so really , really cool experiments , which really put in these <unk> projects there in these <unk> .
so , these are good to magazine , who are really good , there 's all of all of them , yes , yes , but who 's i going to come up ?
just , basically , the ones who are interested in .
in the <unk> , we are always called the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , the ones who are interested in doing this , which is the <unk> , yes , beautiful and good .
nice magazine , finally the audience who are interested in for that , and perhaps perhaps about a idea where the <unk> are in these papers .
who 's the <unk> i really do ?
the <unk> who are doing it in the way it 's doing it .
the way that we could do is now , now , the editor of the <unk> , i call him mr. <unk> <unk> , who read it under circumstances of circumstances , i tried to keep it in a way , i do n't really understand that , i do n't really do .
but nevertheless , again , our future are going to be a way to be in the way we 're just looking at the <unk> .
fracking , <unk> , renewable energy , <unk> , these are all things that are <unk> , but not really understand the story of the <unk> , but not really understand the things that he 's been able to do .
my project , my idea is , so , is , in a way , <unk> , these little , young , young , young scientists , very <unk> , very <unk> , very completely <unk> from his regular <unk> , and there 's a kind of course of
so what 's mostly happened is that a scientist , i 've got a buddy , we 've got a buddy , we know , for good two years , it 's <unk> , it 's not a <unk> rule , not to ask him to questions .
and as soon as he said , and he tells the mouth and tells us about his job , he 's <unk> us .
<unk> , these are scientists who tell you what a bit of <unk> .
<unk> , hear it sounds like , <unk> , <unk> , is almost as the same level like genes .
it 's treated by the dark , it 's kind of , oh , you do n't know what 's behind .
and the real time , you know , you know , again , it 's nice , and you know , you know , if you 're on a conference , and you know , your people , your <unk> , you want to tell you , you know , `` <unk> '' and '' and you know , `` <unk> '' and ''
where is the problem , it 's really <unk> and normal ?
so i school , this is my idea , these young scientist who are not so far in the hierarchy of hierarchy , which is a little bit of malleable , and i think , to be a little bit of how to make up .
this is a use of all , <unk> , but anyway , investors who want to see what 's going to happen in the <unk> .
and finally , the name of the tax tax , who are being used to be used to be used to communicate the <unk> .
but the training , this is just one story .
i also want to put them in a jury , and i want to introduce you a <unk> , and you want to introduce her project , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , worse , worse , worse , it 's not : kids .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if this is real , is that 's a little bit of albert einstein : if you ca n't explain it , you did n't really understand it .
so , the scientists of the lab and you think of the project , how can i think that 's really normal ,
so , there 's a lot of stories , there 's a lot .
<unk> are totally modern , is all the university , common , but i 'm going to get it in the whole university , but i 'll just put it back to the <unk> .
who 's driving the <unk> end of the city at some <unk> , and then you get a talk to a talk about <unk> in the university ?
these are the ones that are anyway .
i got my <unk> .
so , these are people who are interested in for that , and you 're looking at all the talks there .
that 's nice , there 's a <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> are all , all are happy , and it 's it .
so i 'm going to put in a second one point , say , it 's not there in this <unk> project .
these scientists are still trained to keep the blind thing like <unk> children ?
because many really <unk> have to reduce the most important .
because scientists , like the research , and how kids are exploring their world , the same .
children are very sophisticated .
they do something like that .
you try to try and try to work ?
<unk> , fall , we 're going to do , do n't work , it does n't work , next piece , i change a few parameters , it 's new to it .
children learn very sophisticated .
these are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i 'm <unk> , what happens , what happens i need to change , or not .
that 's normal !
but that 's a lot of <unk> .
and so i think , from the way that , i think , if you can work , and then the scientist in the neighborhood are able to make the local school in the conversation from school , and in the school of the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in
and then you might have , maybe , maybe i think , this is so my hope , i 'll tell you the hope that i 'm going to go home , and then i get to mr. <unk> , who also talk to scientific topics , because children 's kids to tell him .
and then this is not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere in galileo , but his kids tell him something that <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , that it has a bread in a <unk> , and then also , then it 's also a bread and then also <unk> a way to build a house .
and not only get to me , of course , of course , of course , `` <unk> '' and i also have the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
but unfortunately , it 's just about that , the first <unk> , said , `` yes , '' said , `` well , <unk> , '' so , <unk> for our scientists , that 's not just a subject that have just other priorities .
a scientist has not just communicate .
yeah , i think , okay , i 'll call it , i call the next one .
but who 's working in a department , <unk> is in a company , and still , there 's the next break .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
fly . you do n't have a day .
the last couple weeks , were awful .
the weather has made us a big line of the bill .
seven , seven years ago , eight years , i was asked if i want to take this here .
i was in the <unk> , almost 10 years , at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and in <unk> .
we 've got there in the top .
had <unk> , as a customer .
and i was actually , it was really , well , that 's <unk> .
what do n't that ?
and so , <unk> , this is actually ridiculous .
but i 've had learned that who 's behind it , and that 's why i 'm here today .
and maybe it 's a little bit crazy , but it 's too emotionally .
it 's beautiful and it 's exciting and it 's great fun .
and i 'm going to talk to you in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes , a little bit of this life of a <unk> .
i 'm an apple in the <unk> .
the company has been done for a hundred and a <unk> years .
i 'm an latest <unk> of the <unk> .
this company has been over for 20 years .
and , the <unk> of the <unk> .
the company has been over about <unk> or <unk> years .
the one of the <unk> here is at the <unk> .
marcus : the zeppelin .
one image i want to show you here , which is a little point of right , which is actually a red , so a <unk> in a <unk> , right , is n't exactly what 's too big .
there 's the world 's largest <unk> .
and there 's just a 10 to only 10 .
that 's what you see .
there 's about six thousand active active active active active .
so that 's actually not a market .
it 's not even a unique .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also : why does you do that ?
how does this do it ?
and in the time , 10 , 10 , there 's another one , and we can talk about this .
quite a little bit of story .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
very short , very short .
has fallen to 14 14 in the first world war in the world .
and then in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died , by the way , by <unk> , <unk> <unk> , became <unk> <unk> .
and then , the <unk> was bombed and so on and so forth .
and when we were <unk> and eight to london , and with a big <unk> , there 's a <unk> project where i could fly the english campaign , with the <unk> of the <unk> , this is the <unk> of the <unk> , but not to be involved in peaceful .
so the story has been in a suite of <unk> .
and we had an wrong campaign .
but <unk> , the customer was not so much , because all of the sudden , it 's going to see what there was there , which had the old memories of the old memories in the way .
and you know , you know , is a little bit more critical to the marketers .
but in london , it was a good campaign in london , except the weather in the north , there was a lot of bad years ago , very much and very <unk> .
and we 're not a lot .
then <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and an <unk> list , then that was brought to america .
this has a myth that has been in a particular state that has been a very high nation in the world , and that 's the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
there was in new york , with <unk> .
and the whole german nation has gone down , we 're back who are .
this is in all <unk> , and that 's really the idea of this myth that 's a little bit of this device .
but actually , until <unk> and <unk> are only five , six , seven , <unk> , and actually just two right , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , the passengers has been <unk> .
passengers , hundred , where <unk> passengers and <unk> <unk> were <unk> <unk> .
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> of the time , the first live in the country was <unk> , unfortunately , too , unfortunately , too .
next to the titanic , where one looks like a icon , a product , and then it 's never going to get back to the end of the .
the other way were also hired .
and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> the last time of the same way .
the materials are used to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and then there was nothing about <unk> years .
and then the had the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the zeppelin who had the idea , maybe you should begin to begin .
and i was hired to <unk> , because you 've developed a great product , and we get to the market .
yeah , he 's a market in the ground ?
what is there in ?
so .
we 're going to talk about it now .
the <unk> <unk> , perhaps , perhaps , is just a moment to explain , and we 're <unk> , `` you know , it 's still a lot of done .
there are many companies who ran from this <unk> .
it 's <unk> employees , about 20 billion dollars .
this is a real economy , for the <unk> .
there 's a lot of behind .
and i 've got me thinking , there 's a lot of coming here .
the zeppelin is actually a regular plane like each other plane , but has , excuse me , is <unk> , has a gas , helium , <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> with <unk> .
is like a whale that 's on the water and we have a <unk> , and there 's got to make the <unk> .
now , the time is not going to explain that in detail .
inside , a <unk> looks like a structure .
there 's two kinds of <unk> .
there are <unk> <unk> , which is we , <unk> in the case and <unk> .
there 's no fabric of fabric and they 're like <unk> in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> of the world who have been built in the world , four , <unk> piece .
and there 's only one of the things i said earlier , just to <unk> , just to our own life , so on , just a second time .
so that 's how it comes into the production when a bone is going to be completed .
the left is a little bit of the right .
and the bone is also <unk> .
come from the <unk> .
and then , the astronauts of the astronauts .
and then , the <unk> are there .
one point is a point of two million dollars a piece .
and it has to be <unk> , and it has to be <unk> , and you have to be <unk> , because you have to see , and again , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , you have to see , if you have a
there are the <unk> and <unk> and look at just if you can be able to be able to be able to be holes .
and the end of the end is a <unk> without the south korea is like it 's .
so the zeppelin is technically a <unk> product .
and this looks at the bottom here , quite a short time .
one point nine percent , one point of nine percent , one point of six percent <unk> , which is called a thousand thousand years of <unk> <unk> .
that 's very little , very well , very well .
this is a <unk> .
the answer is .
but there 's another trend that 's been involved in the moment , and i 've been shown here on the top .
we had three years ago , three years ago , as i started before <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent , <unk> percent <unk> , <unk> percent or <unk> percent .
and this year in may , we were at <unk> percent .
if you 're the eight years , my eight years , with <unk> and <unk> of it , you know , at least , in these eight years , of course , one <unk> of the eight years , of course , in this eight years , the five years of
we are <unk> .
we ca n't fly passengers in <unk> .
you want to see something .
and the <unk> or <unk> <unk> are actually going to be done every year .
so a little picture of the weather is that our weather is not just as far , but statistically , because we 're going to do weather every day .
but because this is so good , the european union <unk> a program <unk> , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're a safety part of this program .
i 'll get in the morning right now , right ?
the <unk> is , is a flying lab .
<unk> is called the campaign .
and we 're doing <unk> in the <unk> of the earth and <unk> feet .
it 's called <unk> .
and the zeppelin t flies from italy to <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
in many many hundred hundred bucks , the and analyze the air , as it 's like the air , how they 're going to react to our things we do on the ground .
there 's what i 'm looking at , there 's the second <unk> , we 're just with the second <unk> .
a great assignment .
and is when you want to be able to make a sense of <unk> in the subject .
so this is very good .
and here 's a couple of <unk> .
the <unk> about sweden is the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland , by the way , the weather is super <unk> , <unk> , <unk> level , 30 degrees .
the <unk> are saying that they had never had .
i 've had a wonderful , nice <unk> days .
the killing were n't as bad .
we were also in africa .
and have been <unk> by <unk> <unk> , they were looking at the <unk> increase in the <unk> , which are <unk> <unk> by millions of years .
just you can ask , you know , is all africa , that 's a different thing , if you ask , to ask , to ask yourself , to ask yourself , to ask yourself , to ask yourself , to a idea , to ask yourself , it 's a sense of questions , it 's a sense of questions , it 's a sense of questions , it 's a sense of meaning in the cinema , the film was going to be <unk> in the movie ,
so , i wondered , what do we do there ?
and what do we do in general , right ?
and at the end , we were still done in two years .
and then the <unk> did n't go on .
the whole <unk> came out at the time , and then the project was stopped .
and a tornado had the zeppelin at the mast in the mast that he could be able to be able to stay in the bottom .
but was n't so bad .
we had a good thing to be <unk> , and they were really happy .
and that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what i should do .
yes , what we do today is , a very quick proxy from the <unk> .
what we 're doing is , it 's about it 's about complexity , it 's about questions or the country .
what we 're doing is the <unk> of this in <unk> .
we 're going to do the <unk> .
we have to get the zeppelin and get the zeppelin .
<unk> is called aging .
there 's still a little bit of devices , there 's no way to take , and we 've got to have to have to be brought back , and you have to be brought back .
we 're just replacing the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there 's the clients who are <unk> about it , we 're still talking about it .
we have to do the <unk> all the time .
we 're an <unk> <unk> , which is controlled by the german <unk> and the european muslim , and all the things that are going to be connected to <unk> or <unk> .
this is also <unk> and costs money and it 's still going to get them and continue to get it .
the question is , does you go ?
do you want to provide on ?
do you make bigger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
what do you do ?
you continue to go in the market ?
you continue to go in the business ?
and that 's what we have to try and more , i 've also miss it .
and there 's a few <unk> .
and by the way , the <unk> <unk> ran some <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> of the <unk> were <unk> .
the german population has saved him in the time , and he saved him with six million <unk> than a <unk> , when the fourth <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he 's basically broke the population of a donation .
and from the <unk> <unk> , and they 've created the other companies , otherwise we do n't have <unk> or <unk> , and i would n't have any other companies and also other companies would be there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and they 're listening to san francisco with a customer .
there was a very <unk> <unk> .
both projects are sadly , unfortunately .
so , again , <unk> .
at the same time , we won <unk> .
there 's no picture that i ca n't show up because we could n't show the <unk> .
but in america , now , the first time is now in the first <unk> of the first <unk> .
we sold three piece .
and with <unk> , we 're developing a partner in a partner , and we 're doing a technology .
and that 's a big success , but the <unk> act .
two customers are basically <unk> , because it did n't go .
why did n't it ?
we actually know .
either was n't the place where the place had not the right or the passengers had to have to be far to far <unk> or in america , you know , `` the last 30 attack of years who have done advertising .
the <unk> people have <unk> , have the <unk> , have said , `` <unk> , again , a <unk> , which makes advertising .
there 's no idea that you could n't know , that you could n't get there .
and it was actually twice the marketing in marketing : hey , people call it , and it flies .
<unk> .
the pilot has to transport the year , and they 've got to put it , <unk> passengers , <unk> passengers .
but last year , we 've only have <unk> satellites because weather .
there 's a lot of a million .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin is <unk> routes here .
and it 's the sense of the feeling of course , of course , when i look at the <unk> , and then you get the laughing and all of you and all of it , and we do n't have a advertising , because it 's going to be a little bit of <unk> and over again , and again , people who have been <unk> and say , and who 's still going to be so much , and who 's still going to continue to go and still continue to go and
and we were great <unk> .
so i always got to open up with the <unk> with the mistake that you think we think we are <unk> .
you could still do it still .
we have such a <unk> in the <unk> and we 're <unk> .
and that 's actually not quite a little bit .
we also do a advertising .
this is a project science , the <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> did this made this island with the island .
but the <unk> community is a difficult market .
and you have to ask yourself a <unk> , and you do n't think of advertising ?
we actually have enough commercials , but the internet has much changed , the <unk> <unk> are going to control the way , because the <unk> control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there 's just 10 , the 10 , is 10 , <unk> <unk> in the world .
we have three .
two active , one of them , a camera , the <unk> , three , you bought , 10 are active .
so , six of 10 .
that 's what we 're going to do is actually , when it 's actually , if it 's a thing to do .
and hope to come from again , again , to make a future .
and what i 'm david <unk> , the <unk> of the apollo <unk> of apollo <unk> , after his <unk> paris , and five , he said , `` the walk of the <unk> <unk> .
so , nice , is beautiful .
now , advertising is also making it beautiful .
just do n't find the customers .
and we 're going to find a technology trend , and we find a technological value .
there are the customers .
it 's not yet .
it 's <unk> , and it 's <unk> .
so a <unk> , needs to have a year to be a <unk> .
and then there is no years .
there 's also funny effect that are easy to control and find too much .
in each case , this is the situation , <unk> , a point in the world market , so it 's not a market .
but we 're going to continue .
it 's a icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to make it .
you just do n't just ask the question : what form we do ?
how much money we have in the world ?
what do we do for here ?
what kind of shape is going to run the way ?
and i personally , you 've got to say something personal , i 'm not a <unk> , of my story , where i wanted to <unk> <unk> , and i wanted to get a <unk> <unk> , and then i want to get the little <unk> dead , it 's also going to go .
i was also a even more <unk> three years , when i 've seen from vancouver island , and i 've seen this whole <unk> jungle , i 've got so <unk> that i 've done .
and then there was a <unk> of greenpeace that are <unk> , who are <unk> of the money , and not know what they should have to do and basically <unk> .
there 's been <unk> to <unk> this .
and i 've been calculated , we have greenpeace <unk> in the time , and now i 'm doing this in hope to make a long future in the zeppelin .
zero , is that ?
morton bast
yes , thank you .
these are my three points that i 'd like to talk to the <unk> minutes .
why are we in the abundance of the abundance or abundance ?
how do we get to a <unk> ?
and all , what do you do ?
what is the point of what is really ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is , perhaps a little bit of cool .
but it 's also to show the challenges .
a few years ago , this is more difficult to explain .
that we have a problem today , every child .
that 's the problem .
but again , it 's already worth that again , the challenges of the population growth growth .
all kinds of <unk> are exponential .
when you see it in a historic long way , the way that the way that is going to be a very short proxy to the story .
so the moment we ca n't imagine that it 's kind of different from the way that the way that is actually going to go over again .
you know the climate change that has the last <unk> years .
some of them say , well , there were , we were in the past , we have the last <unk> years .
so you can also look at <unk> , i 'm also right .
you can also say who needs to have the <unk> ?
you can also say , `` the ocean is far away .
but it 's now , if you get a little bit more specifically to really , to be real challenges to avoid things that are really to avoid , otherwise we just have trouble in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the <unk> health .
it 's called it , it 's a little bit of food over 30 months .
and there 's degree in our cities like in vienna or <unk> , and in the <unk> , still still <unk> and more .
but it 's also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas where the great streams is , and the <unk> of the <unk> that are going to come from water from the himalayas .
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is the <unk> , which is there , there was a lot of bigger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us to people , which are very obvious to a change ecosystems .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts spread out .
the freshwater is less .
this is the aral sea , where a consumer part of our cotton .
and that 's all where this comes from ?
all the bad things , tell you all , i 'm going to stand up with a person in one or another form with the global <unk> .
with what we get in the entire earth , which we harvest .
not only , the oil and the minerals and minerals , but also the renewables are renewable resources , but the end of them are not going to go .
and we 're looking at just looking at that as possible as possible , they use to produce less <unk> and emissions .
so , it 's about the <unk> in the <unk> , already in the entire <unk> , really dramatically dramatic .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not only c , two , <unk> of a car , and really live in life .
different from the economies .
our technology is completely new .
when we look back , the soviet union and famine , and there 's still on earth 's areas that live in principle , and we 're living in the ground , that 's a ton of resources in the year , and over a year .
in a <unk> , it was three to the human history of five tons .
today , it 's been a half to <unk> .
so , this is <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , very <unk> distributed on earth .
it 's more than north america than it 's been more than the earth .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa very , very much less .
and that 's where we have a <unk> , which is the implications of us , which is the air , which is much better in the last decades , but it 's basically the most important in the last few decades , but it 's basically the most important in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world are still going to be less .
and that 's why the conflicts we see , is , is , afghanistan , where they look at the most of the american <unk> survey , and then you see where the resources are coming .
and that 's there it 's particularly colorful , which is there , there 's a lot of resources there , where the <unk> are the world .
so if we want to make up with it , we have to have to have to be involved in the subject .
so we need to change the ecological boundaries everywhere , the <unk> is all over .
and what we have is , what we have in <unk> life is not so much more precise .
this is the mahatma gandhi , when he said , the world has enough to everybody 's needs , but not for everybody greed .
and there 's how we 're going to live in the average of the average , it 's really much more about it .
so .
and that was the kind of <unk> part .
but i always find that you need to need to understand the idea of understanding what it 's worth .
even though i would say , it would be worth like this , to live , which is more one more .
but it 's still , but over the <unk> , you need to say , `` you know , '' i 'm a rationale for saying , `` tell you . ''
so , what is a <unk> ?
and there 's what we have to see in our rich parts of the world , the same thing that has been there so much economically , socially , socially , in living in living in the average of living , not just not necessarily not necessarily not necessarily good at the average of the average .
so here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people who are also telling people who ca n't have so good at this story .
i wrote there .
<unk> climate change has the same cause .
we 're too much and too heavy .
this is on the one side , we get in stress , and then there 's too much .
i also love very much .
and on the other side , we 're going to get this <unk> .
what is a good life ?
how can we define that ?
now , a little scientific paper is coming up .
and also , what i 've got told before and say , is a very exponential of success , but here 's it 's going to be a little bit like this , so i think i mean , i think i was going to define the way that i 've got ?
and there 's important to understand life , still two aspects of life .
quality of life has the objective conditions like me to go , what i 've got to eat .
i have a roof on the head ?
did i have friends ?
i mean , i mean , i mean , can i be involved in life ?
but just how do i go to how do i get around ?
i 'm feeling that i think it 's a little quality of life .
and then i put two things to make a difference in the ground .
one is needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human flourishing , our part of the human being , to be emotions .
when we 're happy , we 're happy .
and needs you ca n't say , needs to be sustainable or unsustainable .
needs of se <unk> are not going to <unk> .
what are needs ?
you can quote from different scientists , i just have two called two .
and of course , you see , of course , physical needs , but also , need to say , need to safety , to social relationships .
after protection , after food , after <unk> , after creativity , after the <unk> .
this is a little bit of doing what to do with money .
but in a big part , but the question is , but the question is , i 'm looking at how i ran in my life .
and there 's the second important term .
strategies .
the strategy i 've got to have to have to meet me to meet me .
and there 's what you 're going to go to , i 'm like a high <unk> or a low <unk> .
there i need a lot of money or not a little bit .
and strategies are my behavior like me to <unk> my needs .
and that 's what i have to do with my values , with the resources , with the capabilities that i have .
if i 'm a little bit of money i 'm going to try to be able to make my needs to satisfy the things when i have a lot of money in the time .
it 's first about the <unk> , which is the roof of the head , and then it 's like the <unk> .
and here 's where there 's a thing that can be with much or little <unk> , which can be sustainable or <unk> .
and when we have the whole strategies that are available to me to satisfy my needs , then we talk about a lifestyle .
so .
this was the scientific <unk> .
and now , what 's now is now , what can we do now ?
how does it go ?
and there 's just a few evidence .
of course , this is also a little bit of , and that 's also a little bit of themselves .
but the evidence on the individual kind of technology , is , that 's the idea of science , and finally , in a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
the slides at the beginning , used to have told the threat to be more than more consumption , and more resources , more resources , more resources .
and then , the quality of life expectancy goes down to <unk> , because the effects are always getting worse , , , and we 're going to beat up the end of the end up .
or , whether we 're doing it , there 's something that can go in another direction that can go to less <unk> , maybe with less consumption , but with a higher quality of quality of quality .
there 's one of my favorite , maybe it 's probably going to know some , <unk> of the subject , so more quality of life with less <unk> .
there 's a lot of technology , like , i can use any of the two things that we 're using this , the phone , the coffee , the coffee , the traffic , how can i make it ?
cement can make a different way , i can build the house from wood , etc. , etc .
to create less <unk> or the same life , or the same quality of life .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , we have a lot of the <unk> , and there 's what 's been going to be a very deep in the ground .
where are the needs ?
what services could i do ?
and how can i do that with the most little bit more ?
and there is not a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there are many examples of the things that can be done in .
in vienna , a tower is built in the tower with six <unk> .
and with seven <unk> , it 's built in <unk> .
essentially , this is from wood .
you might not need to take it out , and you can not take any more and <unk> , and then they do n't like the parts , and not , so that 's a lot of things that we have to get around with half , and the goal is to be a fifth of the <unk> , about this <unk> of the <unk> .
but it 's also a lot in our own , sort of , like , how <unk> i actually do ?
<unk> <unk> wrote a beautiful book , called <unk> .
where he shows how hard it is , in the end of this , is from this treadmill from this treadmill .
the <unk> , i want to take a way to another <unk> , and then i am forever forever in this race .
you were a <unk> , and you know , i 've got a little bit quickly , and then i 'll get the new .
and i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to have the most popular <unk> , you know .
when i started my institute , a few years ago , we wrote letters .
and you can just wait to be a letter , and i 'm writing a letter , i 'm serious <unk> , is a <unk> <unk> .
that 's a few of email to email .
and i can afford very much more .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we 're going to come back .
but i did n't really have a really time .
i did n't done a lot of it .
but there 's good examples , slow food , for example , where i really do , to the risk of quality and the claim of the <unk> in the foreground .
and with a very low <unk> of life .
one of my favorite examples is <unk> .
there 's been the world that you 've been doing is that a average average person in germany , in fact , has a decade of tens of thousands of the age of the household .
you can have the same thing to be <unk> .
who 's two , two , three generations of 10 , the other , had employees , was <unk> .
they have managed to have the tribal .
we have to deal with it .
and less people get clear , with all the options .
and we need a stick to give us to us with these few things that are <unk> with these two things .
so , the idea of what i think is , perhaps , maybe i 'm also a little bit more sophisticated , perhaps , the same thing i think , probably from a decade of the other things .
the next example is to have a use of use .
a true boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> , maybe had been developed in a alternative range of time ,
in the meantime , it 's always using more people when they think of <unk> .
when you think about <unk> .
platforms , models that are just working with how to work , which can have been built in the things that we 've been built in a few hundred years ago , and still have been able to use over the other centuries of the end of the end .
and what once was going to be used to use a lot of use .
that 's also a question of justice .
i found you earlier how <unk> that is as a picture between africa and europe and a whole world .
so , as all of the same time , all the same time , is just using these resources , then , then we can use less less .
and that 's not less quality of quality , because many of us have been in a lot of us already .
but it 's a important task of the economy , the companies , these products , these products , that services are really available to a good life with a lot less resources .
last point , that has a big deal with the big policy , which is the growth of growth , i think i was .
when you find a little bit of attention , it 's a little bit of surprising , it 's <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , this is the <unk> that 's <unk> to the bottom .
it 's called a crisis , and it 's a crisis in the door , and also , and i think , and also , i 've been talking about economists , and so there are the numbers of austria , they 're going to be a lot of growth in the bottom of the countries , it 's easy to the bottom .
and there is no reason to have growth , so how i know that , like i do n't know that from my youth , from the <unk> years .
part of the things that is in mathematical reasons .
one point five percent growth today today , is so much as eight percent growth in years .
and eight percent is what china has .
and they 're also about there , where we were left , we 've been a 50 years ago .
by the whole , if the pies is bigger , of course , is that it 's harder to eight percent .
one percent is still much , so we 're going to do so much .
but you have to hire a little bit of a way to hire that , not , not even if we had zero growth , that 's what we had zero growth , that 's what we have to produce so much , and they consume it as a year .
we can invest in all , and we can work with it .
that 's not so much so backwards , because you know these statistics , which is not going to be in the growth of life .
the economy is growing , but the quality of life remains in the <unk> countries that we are .
and by the way , jobs are also possible without growth , and it 's not not really connected to all of these , as you get over and over again , and as you 're going to be <unk> , and how they 're going to be called the hot note .
and it 's not just true , and then you have to get in the same with economies .
and it 's always getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than <unk> or next week , the way i think that 's a big story , a bigger story with this subject , which is more relevant .
already , edward <unk> , who was <unk> , nobel prize <unk> in his <unk> , that he said the good life , the good economy , the good economy , the good life .
now , this is the end of the end , not primarily to provide <unk> , not primarily to create growth in growth , which is not going to be more .
for <unk> and these countries , also for china , for india , there 's a serious story .
and that 's just as a result , which is also going to go down , when we 're still going to grow there , and we just like to have on this level , on this high level , which we are good at life and economies .
it 's also going to be policy .
it takes goals .
it takes a lot of <unk> , say the economists .
it does n't need to be just like the growth , but we should look at it , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , how is it really with the quality of quality , it 's going to be on ?
is the obvious thing ?
and then we have to measure our politicians .
of course , how about the <unk> is the <unk> ?
how do this go together ?
we need a fundamental aspect of the one that 's finally , finally , finally , and not the work .
who are you all of you in the entrepreneurs who are in the tables , but the workers , you know , very good .
what 's kind of <unk> hidden , we know , at all , we 've spent a colleague at all the <unk> .
you could make a different way .
the resources are also , and so they 're also <unk> and not the resources of the work and not the work .
and you 've got to get all the <unk> in order to ensure employment , to ensure aid , health , infrastructure , without growth .
but that 's what you 're going to do , but you have to be a little bit more difficult .
so , that means , you know , more or less , on all levels can work in these direction , we can work hard to be the right products , services , as a consumers , what we need to do , how do we do that , what is what we do , what is
what do we need and do n't we need ?
the right policy , the <unk> , the <unk> .
a few evidence i gave .
and then , of course , of course , the science of the science is also going to be in the other economists , still in the direction , how can we boost growth ?
but unfortunately , there 's no way .
when you look at the visible , if you look at the last 20 years , it 's always going to be down because it 's not .
the policy does n't do and not going to do n't are growth , but that 's the question of how to go to the question , and that 's how we have a good life ?
so , <unk> 's it .
be the <unk> to the <unk> .
with heart , brain , hand , and last , and last , the <unk> are going to be going to need to be a <unk> .
thank you .
i 'm a <unk> <unk> .
and i love these city .
this city has to tell you so many stories .
one of them have happened a few hundred years ago .
and there 's a creative thing .
and on this creative problem , i get a moment , and then there 's a little bit later .
they 're going to do with the fortress .
this is serious <unk> who is in the middle of these city , and a lot of these city and also changing .
one other story before .
it was a hot summer day in <unk> , nevada .
one man , what you see is , in his shoes , it 's right now .
it 's warm .
he 's europeans , he did n't know that it 's like the heat .
he 's making a <unk> of the shoe , and it 's not a <unk> increase in a long <unk> , and there 's several times in several holes in several holes .
he 's <unk> the shoe , and he 's gone down , and he 's going to see a new climate change .
it 's the shoe , who is born .
and these number one thing you see here is the shoes in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> today .
a company is <unk> , with four letters .
one or another one of them knows it .
he has the original idea even to count , and they have <unk> .
both have been rejected .
so he says , good , <unk> , i do my own business .
and he 's called the stock market .
there are several thousand workers in <unk> business in <unk> countries in the world .
so much of a creative thing .
why not a new invent , what is n't there ?
and then , perhaps , is the question to be summarized by <unk> .
if you do n't know , it 's not yet familiar , it 's for what is a chance ?
and the question is that the question i 've been doing is often , in tough situations .
if there was wrong with something or my <unk> , or technology , not work or whatever .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what is a chance ?
and you 've got to get in the <unk> in the <unk> .
what the difference can do , i 'm telling you with this example .
and another example , of course , became the <unk> <unk> , and that 's the <unk> statements of <unk> .
and the evidence that is how creative people can be , if it comes to their own insurance .
i show you a few examples here .
so , these are actually <unk> at the <unk> <unk> and it did a commercial .
i 'm really excited about this .
my son did n't get the woman .
he 's just <unk> , and the woman 's woman 's <unk> .
or i had the whole day , <unk> , when i reached the intersection , all of a bush in my view , and i could n't see the other vehicle .
yeah , who 's being to be , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 've been a <unk> , and two times nearly .
and there 's the most <unk> of the <unk> ,
the last one i was not to be a <unk> .
it was a young woman in the <unk> .
when you 're a man , each other is obsolete .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it anyway .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i wish and i teach dreams that we all use more of this creativity .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that 's not that way .
why not things do n't even more ?
old things we 've got to do is that the routine might have been bored or <unk> , as opposite .
why not just do n't just do anything , the <unk> , as little simple simple .
and there 's so <unk> businesses that use that .
for example , the <unk> , who have these <unk> from their power , these signs or the wall , or at the wall , and then there 's a little bit of what it 's on .
one way , right ?
so , the coffee you get to go to the coffee 's <unk> .
or what .
we do n't have a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
is that 's now , right ?
if you ca n't do this cell phone ,
or even , they 're still starvation in .
<unk> , but creative .
that 's what it takes .
i have a person who would be the customer or the people who would be <unk> and say , okay , that 's like me .
i 'm from the <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and in <unk> .
once the sports , the most recent news , the policy .
when you were there , when you were three times , you 're <unk> .
once the complaint had been the complaint about a long time , too .
it 's a <unk> building , and the restaurant , and the restaurant , and the restaurant , and the restaurant , so the restaurant had a little bit of being happy to do all hands .
it was too closely .
have been thinking , together , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't get faster in the kitchen .
the idea is , one thing is created .
in each of each table , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> salt , pepper and <unk> .
so that the people in the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait
just just different .
a creative idea , and maybe also solved with the <unk> .
there 's a person who 's not just <unk> .
you know , this person is the leader of the <unk> , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and now , the german signs of the way .
now , the second day , it takes a monday , so four days .
a company has been elected <unk> , and you might have a lot of the <unk> .
a <unk> says , rather than <unk> , we thank you .
people are coming to the day of the day .
the buses are packed , it 's <unk> , people are organizing in carpool because everyone of other , of other , of a <unk> , from a after .
but why do n't we have a kind of use of use and creative from his disadvantage ?
sometimes it 's happening too much more creativity .
and it 's coming from a <unk> , perhaps , like this companies you might know .
so we 've known that there 's not really good at the <unk> , but that they have to save a lot of <unk> in the <unk> .
or in the <unk> in the car .
and we know , we know , the different , <unk> , all kinds of directions .
yes .
why not be a piece of <unk> in the car , when you 're <unk> ?
or in <unk> , there 's also a difference in order to make a creative .
and all of it is just with humor , with the <unk> , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
my <unk> son , my <unk> son , in office .
and i 'm on this <unk> .
so , we have several <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he turns out of links , he has a pleasure , and i 'm telling me in my secret <unk> , '' you know , `` you do n't stop , `` you do n't say , `` yes , ''
he 's too , look at me , great eyes , playground , playground .
and in the moment i 'm actually , it 's right ?
why is n't a playground ?
why is what we do , not the playground for adults ?
but this is a lot of things that 's a lot of getting .
when we 're blind , if we use our talents , what we do .
and so that 's done , and they 're doing a relaxed way .
the <unk> is that when a particular day of the week is changing in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week and somehow , our focus on a day .
so , one day , we would rather be a lot of things that 's often .
that 's how the weekend .
you hear that in the media .
<unk> is , yeah , a day to weekend .
or if you announced the most beautiful time of the year , the vacation 's disease .
what are the rest of the day of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
have we all so terrible jobs ?
a <unk> had been given it on the cover , this topic .
yes , monday , i 'm out , i 'm and the rest of life you want to do .
or on <unk> , facebook , all over the social networks are taken this subject .
i once <unk> in the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i 'd like to look at the way .
what have these in the <unk> , what are there ?
and one day , i was making a business with this person to buy this .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , that 's pretty nice .
so , from that , from that love , rather than working .
i 'm <unk> , i 'm a parent of five children , but i also love my work .
yes .
or even <unk> for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
why the own attitude , which is shown there , and it 's always going to continue to get more and further .
somebody who has a answer to this direction , it 's not the monday , it 's your jobs .
and i actually actually ask with the pink <unk> , and say , okay , go to the <unk> .
what about my job is beautiful ?
stupid is , even if it 's the pink glasses , it looks like before .
so , something nice , it 's not nice , does n't work .
the pink pair of glasses is really great to the bicycle .
there 's what you 're going to fly , you know , you know , you know , you see , you know , you see , you would fly the flying position , which is otherwise going to be in the eye .
but they do n't <unk> .
where is that going to be that when we do n't change this ?
in fact , the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside of the company , outside of the company .
it might end up in a system where we feel like that as we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes up a game and running and running and running and walk , and then , it 's going to quickly get to quickly , and then you get to quickly , this wheel , the poor mouse and you get out .
what does the mouse do ?
you know nothing else , you 're in the <unk> .
and again , and again , maybe the movie is <unk> the <unk> , you might have done it , and then you will not make it soft .
this is nice <unk> here with hay , so you do n't , it 's not a little bit of power and it 's always going to go and over again .
and that 's what we 're going to get a funny , probably the mouse thought , yes , yes ?
or something is , it 's called <unk> <unk> .
i was so much as i was so much in a day of a seminar in my journey .
and in a while , the road turned out of me , it was really black in my eyes , and somehow i have to stay .
the next day i was to the doctor , because i thought , what is there ?
he was looking at me and said , no way , is physically all right .
but what 's the <unk> ?
and i looked at my calendar to check this , and saw three weeks , and i was also working on the job .
after six years , in the <unk> and participants who can do first in the afternoon in the night , in the night , the first time in the night .
i 've got to think what are there in jobs ?
and they started making <unk> , again , to look at other priorities , that i 'm going to do time with my family , a good thing for me .
and in fact , whether it 's not a serious <unk> in my job , a new piece of <unk> .
i realized that the talks about the talks about large groups , who are really happy .
i go to like a <unk> and <unk> and other things , but these talks to be allowed to give up , with some of these talks , experiences , to talk to me , and i 'm going to share things right to me .
and that was n't always the case .
i have to see that this <unk> <unk> are ill .
and sometimes it 's right , so it 's right to put this shot , so , <unk> from me , <unk> from me , after the hospital , after he had a heart attack , and then he starts to go on .
in the past , when i said , you go to a meeting , he 's always <unk> me , you have a walk .
it 's the way it 's itself .
so , with <unk> , beautiful , slowly , in the right <unk> , but then we 'll also go together in common .
what happens ?
the bottom line is , we 're all healthier .
the <unk> walk down , but one curve that 's going to be <unk> , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> four percent of four percent of the last 10 years , <unk> percent , almost minus percent , that 's beautiful , that 's less .
rise of the mental illness is plus <unk> percent .
that 's something where i think is that ?
why is that ?
is that a long time in austria ?
no , too , too , in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , that will be healthier .
that 's what you see here is that the left is on the left .
in the bottom of the bottom of the bottom diseases , plus a half percent of the last 10 years , has been a big german age of <unk> .
the number of <unk> <unk> takes .
the cost .
and it 's all about all the official official , what can we do with this topic ?
and so , i think , are also a little bit more useful in the way that you can see , for example .
so , good , it 's good .
and somebody once said , no alcohol , is not no answer .
but what is the solution ?
what is what about it , and it 's still going to be and get it and <unk> ?
and that has been a whole years .
i 've got to have something like this , can be so something like this ?
i 'm a <unk> who 's not the job , not what 's going to be a <unk> and happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , believe , and so on .
but in fact , we 're going to spend the largest part of our <unk> in the work .
and if we do that , why do n't do that , that it 's not like joy and also .
the <unk> <unk> i 'm telling you , and you 'll provide you as a <unk> , and to provide it , and to the <unk> .
these little <unk> , you hope you 'll make a lighter .
<unk> is for talent and freedom and environment .
what is that , how <unk> i mean ?
what do i do in which is i doing that , who are that ?
what i mean , `` do i have to do this , what i want to do ?
because , is the level of <unk> , who are <unk> .
the more of them , the more stress .
and what do i do ?
it 's the muscle .
that 's these four areas are .
and it can check it for themselves .
i had to look at this for me for me , and i just get it again .
can i use my talents ?
what is in what environment ?
and that means , sometimes i go into a cafe with my laptop to prepare for the seminar or a <unk> .
the freedom .
what freedom , i can take to do that , what is important .
and do i do it ?
it 's the muscle .
the last u .
and then there 's people who tell me why that does n't go .
and why is a lot more difficult .
and i 'd like to have a answer to this point .
who wants to find ways .
who is not , there 's reasons .
and by the case , the part of the case is , you know , i think , i think , i think , i need to get ways , or i have some reasons ?
and they 're going to be in two .
so what do we do with our talents ?
everyone 's <unk> who had his big <unk> ever .
it 's much too small .
it 's filled with <unk> , with gold , everything , with their capabilities .
what do we do that ?
by the end of the <unk> , we 're going to ask us that .
or if we 're in the hospital or at the end of a life .
what did i do with my talents ?
and by the way , who 's called , who 's going to get on <unk> <unk> , and you know , to get to a <unk> .
so what we do with our talent is so my first question , also in me , and that 's every day .
i mean , `` do i make a good enough ?
and resources are .
there was something to a story .
i wanted to tell you about <unk> .
and i 'm going to do that one thing .
these fortress was saving saved for the <unk> , by the <unk> years ago , the enemy had the enemies .
and the enemy realized that the fortress was so good that you could n't take them .
thick walls , <unk> ways , the <unk> of the fortress , <unk> doors , <unk> <unk> .
was <unk> at this time .
so the thing , the thing , okay , okay , if we do n't get a box , we form a <unk> .
we do n't get out there , and we do n't blow up .
so , let 's look at how long , the way that it 's doing .
the <unk> thought it was from long until the <unk> had been used to be used .
they 've only had a <unk> of the way that made me get caught <unk> as the <unk> to the chicago , and give me this <unk> and give me three days .
and that 's the okay , <unk> , you have the first thing that i have the first thing , i 'm going to stand up , come , get up , take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> is the way to the <unk> path .
in the time , the enemy is going to be pulled up the <unk> of the hills , led to the left to the left and already early in the early .
well , think , think , a <unk> , what is that .
it 's day .
again , a <unk> <unk> , the top of the fortress , this is the same time , but it 's black .
enemies think oh , who has two <unk> , it might take one more .
the same thing that the night is even , again , it 's the time , who 's really aware of it , and it 's led to it .
at the end of the second day , after six different <unk> , they 've got in a <unk> .
because they thought that 's a long time to do it , that 's not more than that .
afterwards , the <unk> <unk> went down to the <unk> and <unk> .
one thing they had and have the <unk> .
and that 's the <unk> <unk> , and they 've got the <unk> .
i like this idea that everything we need , and that we have everything .
sometimes it 's high resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but also , again , we can do something .
we have no idea of power that we have to invent the world .
and if you believe that could be a good <unk> , then you 're right .
in the spring , the spring rolls .
come .
and we in <unk> know , there 's the snow coming there , it will go out there , the plants are going to go to the plants of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there 's blooms of going to get these blooms of these blooms .
there 's a <unk> here , and there 's <unk> we harvest and eat .
there 's the corn of this grain , we can get into it and then bread .
there 's any animals that eat the food .
there 's people who then eat products later later .
and it 's being automatic .
but if you think that 's what you do n't think about it is that it 's not as automatically it is being <unk> and scared and empowered .
and of course , this threat may just be quite abstract and but in the range of the blooms , the connection of the plant are also <unk> , very , very large , very big .
there 's research that show that to <unk> percent of our food , not there , if we were not there , if we have no bees .
also , also , it 's also a <unk> that 's like this is so normal as we 're not as well , and we may not perceive .
there was a very interesting movie , a very interesting movie , <unk> , for a subject .
and i 'm going to recommend you , look at it .
but now , we 're looking at the gentleman in the lord of the gentleman , which is not working with bees , who are in school , in <unk> , which is the importance of bees .
and that 's what he does with a school at <unk> and he 's going to tell us a little bit about his work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
just a big thank you a big thank you to mr. <unk> and on the whole <unk> .
that i 'm going to be a project , <unk> , <unk> , a few of the bees can contribute about the life of bees .
and also , under a wing , there 's a little wing , which is a little bit of a little bit of paper that makes it fun .
so i 'm going to suppose that the most basic thing is that the most recent thing is that it would be now to be a <unk> company in <unk> minutes in the basics of beekeeping .
i do n't do that , no .
but maybe it might be able to make me to get these <unk> , or a certain empathy of you to develop them to and engage them for this <unk> , <unk> astronomy of the honey .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm a wonderful woman who 's married with a wonderful woman , a woman , a woman of five kids , and i 've got a <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> years of <unk> and adults .
i 'm a member of the <unk> <unk> and in the hunger charity , and i 'm going to <unk> the <unk> .
and now , now , now , now , in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the oldest students in the <unk> students .
we work in the backyard , in agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> is actually a play of <unk> <unk> and is <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is more a <unk> , a quiet , quiet thing .
and she also runs the rest of peace .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not free , the old greeks have known to the context of honey <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he 's like the <unk> <unk> , he gives up his <unk> to <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> , to inspire him , he can be dense .
but the <unk> are not going to go in itself , but they send their blue bees and <unk> the poets in the mouth and then they get to the mouth and then they get to him later , to him , to him , to him , to him , to him , it later , to <unk> the words of the <unk> .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully this tonight is going to me tonight .
yes .
flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of these <unk> , this <unk> of the <unk> are built my students together with me to 30 to <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools in <unk> , the school in the <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> or <unk> in <unk> .
the teacher who is accompanied this project with me in the class and we 're looking at a piece of place for a <unk> place .
the window at the window of the kids can see something like this month .
and all things , so the bees like that , then there are some of the nest entrance to the hose and again .
and then there 's the window to build a room .
so .
and then the whole thing is in me , the <unk> .
so i 'm going to take a <unk> and <unk> , '' now , in a biologically <unk> , and they 're going to put it in this <unk> .
so , important to this <unk> , so they 're also bees .
also , we have <unk> <unk> , and here has to be fresh <unk> , so there 's fresh eggs .
and then one more <unk> , here .
there 's the honey in it .
you need to have a lot of weather , and you ca n't fly .
so .
this is what it looks like .
and then the <unk> here is coming up here , and immediately , the transportation begins with the transportation of the transportation of the transportation of the transportation of the way to deal with the <unk> in the school .
and now , something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees are there in the class of the time , and then there 's a crisis .
their people are not more .
they 're lonely .
they do n't find your queen .
and that 's the most important thing from the <unk> , if he makes these <unk> , that he 's going to be a real role in the old people .
so that 's not the ones that sits on these two <unk> .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they begin to <unk> .
yeah , the <unk> says , she <unk> .
you hear that .
you 've got to get a higher higher higher than you normally get in your <unk> with a queen .
and now , a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night now , they 're going to provide the need to be a new people , and the whole thing happens to be done without <unk> , without conferences without the <unk> , without the religious and positions .
so here 's the people agree and then it 's a <unk> in the first night .
because without the queen , this people would n't exist more .
because <unk> life only have six weeks .
so .
and in this first night , they get out of one of these <unk> <unk> , and they put it into this <unk> .
and there 's a <unk> .
everyone who had <unk> in high school in high school , say , `` do it go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , is all genetic <unk> .
that 's true .
and now , something wonderful .
and this <unk> , what you have to be used to be a <unk> , is going to be a queen .
the <unk> has the first three days of the same genetic code like the <unk> code .
after all , it 's fed by a <unk> .
you know this term .
and immediately , on this <unk> code , the genetic code .
the <unk> are going to change in the <unk> in the <unk> .
we 've heard that before , what we eat , is what 's going to be out of us .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
so three days , so , five days <unk> .
and that 's the students all <unk> .
you see in the class .
and then these cell is <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and the whole thing is happening , because the people now is <unk> or a <unk> , or you say , `` you 're a <unk> , or you do it .
no , this is happening .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or a <unk> option .
and then the students of eight days waiting for every student who knows three five eight eight eight eight , so i was <unk> that the queen 's <unk> .
and so the day , so , if you do , the teachers have to put the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> in the students , in the students , you know , in the students , you know , too five o'clock in the students , yes .
and then the mother , tell what 's going to go ?
yeah , i have to school .
yeah , why ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then the morning to have six in school .
and then the <unk> <unk> on this <unk> , because they want to <unk> the queen now .
and if you see that really , you know , you 're going to hear something .
these queen <unk> .
so .
another higher .
and then the <unk> and <unk> , the queen .
the first thing that these queen is , they spread their wings and there are now <unk> the wings in the upper people who have a queen , their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> .
the people now has a identity .
now three to five days for the age of five days .
and you see the <unk> , you see your <unk> <unk> .
back , the bat comes out , from this <unk> , from this <unk> .
and after five days , this queen 's <unk> itself from the <unk> .
now , some think i 've seen , i 've already seen a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
wait , <unk> .
what 's completely different .
so , let 's go .
these the queen <unk> now in the <unk> and the <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> , from the <unk> .
you 've never seen in your shoe .
in the <unk> and there 's a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , and there 's seven drones of 12 drones , male bees .
so the other other vice versa like islam where the man have a man has got here , the queen who has the seven to 12 men .
and all of the things in a wonderful way in the flight .
the drone is from the back of the back , and the queen , and these queen is now using this <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> , which is to put them to <unk> the eggs for three years .
it 's an amazing experience for the drone , it 's an amazing experience .
when you get finished with the <unk> , she 's dead and drops from the sky .
and then the queen comes back and begins to put eggs .
there 's always a , two students in the class , who see the moment .
and then the queen is immediately the queen .
yes .
and then slowly the project is going to be the project , because the <unk> and the queen is going to be in the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> is going to be inside .
and then i come to one night , then i 'd go to this <unk> .
<unk> from the outside , and on the next morning , i 'm betting the <unk> and the <unk> and the bees to me to me to me .
and there you see the queen .
yes .
<unk> <unk> .
and the amount of it 's 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then there 's the two <unk> that are going to be here in a <unk> .
in a whole stick , in a prey and now , this is a person big and powerful .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the children who have experienced that , forget that 's no .
yes .
there 's not just that , in this class , the students are the whole time , they 're all together , but the whole school comes in this class .
and the teachers when he knows something if he can be prepared to be prepared to join a period of the other .
look , and you see , bees and serious <unk> , we 've got back in the <unk> , where people did n't have the honey to honey .
a few months ago , you 've found a <unk> in israel , which people have found the people who have the bees .
all human culture has grown with bees .
or vice versa , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india , in egypt , in greece in greece in rome in rome .
they were all over the time .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are over .
he can be a <unk> , a <unk> join , he can plug a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , you know , what flowers do or trees , the bees are <unk> what you need ?
that you see something out there now in the summer in agriculture .
there 's a green <unk> in the ground for our bees .
yeah ?
he can go with students in the students in the <unk> and they can <unk> flowers , on the <unk> , you <unk> the <unk> and look at how long , how long we need to do it from my flowers ?
how long are you on the individual , ?
and how long we need to go back to it again .
he can make a <unk> <unk> .
how do i <unk> a <unk> ?
yes .
you know , if this is that , in the <unk> , the top of the top is , is a <unk> page to the top of the top ?
look at all .
he can be a math -- a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can see the students in the students at the <unk> .
and then he 's going to go to the question , how did <unk> get <unk> the nobel prize ?
because it took that the bees are seeing in the beehive .
but ladies and gentlemen , in a beehive , it 's <unk> .
there 's no bee in it .
and just the professor <unk> who taught many years in university in university , in <unk> , in <unk> , the bees are using a <unk> on the individual .
like a <unk> net from the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and now with <unk> hertz , the <unk> , the bees , and the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the honey , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , with their <unk> .
see what these bees are doing in school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose their fear of bees .
and develop a awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , what the bees do .
and they get a warning of these creatures that are only in us to people .
the bees are not even more than the <unk> one of a half a person in the year .
<unk> years ago , the only way to create <unk> .
they collect the <unk> in the trees from the trees .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> of the people .
and now imagine the summer , these are <unk> , <unk> bees on such a narrow space , in <unk> level .
hey , there 's no <unk> without end .
no , not , with the bees .
because they have natural population in this <unk> of antibiotics .
they collect pollen , and it 's that they 're going to <unk> it , it 's going to be a high school <unk> .
someone who have been stopped at the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to provide a <unk> <unk> , and let 's put a <unk> <unk> from the people from the people .
of course , there 's a grid , and with <unk> with a <unk> , and so on , there 's nothing happens .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , the auction of the <unk> of the <unk> , of course , of course , of course , of course , and we would have less apple , and we would have less apple , if the bees would n't fly or we would have to be able to fly like the chinese , and they would have to be able to <unk> the chinese <unk> and the <unk> .
there 's a lot more connections .
look at the <unk> , there 's the <unk> in the <unk> , where the cows graze .
and there 's the bee , and they go to their nectar and <unk> <unk> .
and now the cow comes and and it 's got the <unk> and it 's just because they 'll be <unk> , you can digest .
yeah ?
and then she <unk> that , and it 's obvious , ah , i got <unk> , ah , i can <unk> it .
and then , the milk .
that 's the thing that bee .
yeah ?
and at the end of the end of the paintings , the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of what we have on nature .
the honey .
i 'll just want to get a moment to come up , and i want to get a little bit more .
my students are happy every year when you build these <unk> and then partly me to go together in the schools .
now , this is not my <unk> , but i had a student , and i told you in college school in college , and i told you , `` you know , <unk> <unk> '' and you know , ''
and then he says , yeah , i grew up <unk> .
i come from <unk> and i 'm six years .
and i 've been in <unk> in <unk> , and for the thomas <unk> in the <unk> .
and i 'm glad i 'm not going to learn that i have n't going to learn from the <unk> , but i can learn to learn the hands .
<unk> , yeah , with your head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> college , <unk> college .
and more than half , i said , oh , yeah , we want to .
my students are a huge appreciation of a huge appreciation and the parts of the <unk> , regular and regular and the <unk> people being pulled through the bees .
they 're going to get on <unk> and they get self-confidence , my students and a pride of pride .
how do you get the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how do you get to the <unk> ?
and there 's the person who 's a person who is , there 's the person who are <unk> and there 's a new <unk> .
and he says , `` so , do it start .
the end of a little poem from <unk> <unk> .
who 's like the bee would be the bee by the <unk> , and never going to be the direction of the <unk> , and never loses the direction of the fields in <unk> <unk> , as soon as a moment he would n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love of all friends in the world .
welcome to my project .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of the female <unk> .
in my eyes , the largest crime in humanity , because it 's been <unk> for <unk> years .
the society against women , the women are <unk> to <unk> .
first i 'm looking at .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there 's a <unk> business , a <unk> .
you can think that i did n't think that 's the job of doing it .
i did n't feel <unk> .
and that 's why i was happy to go to the subject of a suite in the subject , and i could n't look at the most exciting way .
for example , this .
with a massive <unk> , over the atlantic from africa , in brazil .
on the world , a meeting in the <unk> are the <unk> genocide in the last <unk> indians in the last <unk> indians .
this was a journey where i was more <unk> than <unk> , more than <unk> .
but yet , these are the way these are attracted to find the interest of media and even more a little person like i could make his cause of the world .
and i 've got to be a little <unk> <unk> in ethiopia .
there was war between the <unk> and ethiopia , and we were <unk> of this killings .
and despite all cruelty , which is the infinite side of the other , the infinite hospitality of the <unk> , who are <unk> <unk> , arab hospitality .
and twice it happened , and we were invaded invaded and our two <unk> , which you see here , and they 're going to <unk> with their bodies as living in front of us , and the <unk> <unk> , these are my people .
if you want to kill you , you have to shoot by us .
something like i 've found a little bit of a different culture .
and in the time in young years , they 've learned that you ca n't reduce islam , and they 're not allowed to reduce terrorism .
and christians do n't want to be reduced to their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather than the true values like someone , social accountability .
these are the values , for the way it 's worth .
i 've been a lot of years , i 've been playing with this <unk> , with my wife .
and there 's the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> .
when i heard that <unk> percent of the american victims , the rest are the <unk> and <unk> , and i 've got to say , `` <unk> '' and <unk> , i thought how to be a <unk> like islam , besides <unk> is also a <unk> of the shoes ?
and the idea was born the highest shifts of islam to explain the practice to sin .
we were looking at some of the <unk> of german organizations that have not found .
now , we would be listening to all , we would be very <unk> , which islam is not to be <unk> .
you would be <unk> the neck .
in <unk> international international , we started designing our own organization .
and they were independent and <unk> .
and so to do this struggle , we needed to win images .
it was a lack of it .
and so , <unk> and i moved back in this desert to make sure to hide with hidden camera .
the bad bloody images , which is not showing you , but i want to get this in a moment of string .
girl in the age of four weeks , eventually , eventually , by the wedding , eventually , by the wedding , eventually , at the end of her parents and relatives , on the side , on the limbs , you put on the limbs , and you 're <unk> at the limbs , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> instruments without <unk> instruments without <unk> instruments without <unk> and anatomy and the <unk> .
what you 're still is a <unk> of a <unk> .
and the <unk> is now a <unk> .
when you get your rule , they were going to have two weeks .
amazing , the body destroys , soul , were trying to be applied .
this was the beginning of what we call <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> , it 's going to go .
the man has to open up .
he never seen one <unk> woman .
the <unk> said he said , `` well , <unk> , is not a problem .
you <unk> your penis with <unk> , and then you poke hard .
and if you do n't do it , not bad .
and you take the knife and <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> .
one third of the girl .
these had been recorded three months ago .
<unk> has lost his language lost .
these are the <unk> , also some in asia .
most of these are <unk> .
and when we were , and when muslims asked , why did you do that ?
was the <unk> answer , which is we have to do that , that 's the koran .
nothing is in the koran , totally in the opposite .
every believers , <unk> <unk> <unk> a lot every day in the prayer , like , <unk> , who 's <unk> , is perfect , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe what they were clapping .
they 're <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of women who had created their women wrong , and why you could be a <unk> person , and so you know , to be <unk> , women <unk> women .
but now we had the first pair of the first <unk> <unk> , this <unk> .
he <unk> us to be a conference in the world .
there was hard conversations for two days .
but we had the minister of the education of our education , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the great decision that has been a practice that has a practice , it 's a practice that 's been against all human rights , against religion , we have to ban him .
the last one was <unk> this new <unk> .
and when you know africa and the <unk> , you know , it 's just made this to these people .
and it became celebrated and the successes we had in other countries .
so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , let 's take a little bit of , <unk> , <unk> , the highest spiritual , which is the message of the country that 's the message of the message that it 's a crime , to write <unk> and carry on the <unk> .
and for weeks , we were the way to build with your own <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had .
and where we came , we have just open ears , open arms and the historic , sacred hospitality .
and when we wanted to leave the country at the time , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to be really all the most common countries ?
so much of it is not going to be more than not .
he 's right .
i 'm a <unk> and there 's a little bit of getting to it .
and in all , he had an idea .
he said , if it 's going to do you , the 10 <unk> muslims in the world , and explain the need to the <unk> , it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo in the <unk> and the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
and when you 're right now , for the <unk> , right now , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> ali , we got a <unk> .
he heard the idea of it was excited about it , especially , when we could make him make it possible that we would finance this .
and that 's what we 're doing about <unk> , which is our support .
and then he said , i 'm not just <unk> , like we had to have a film , but i 'll take a little bit of the <unk> .
and that 's what he did .
over cairo <unk> , the <unk> of our education .
international <unk> to <unk> of the female body of <unk> .
under the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> ali <unk> <unk> .
and all you have come .
hundred <unk> , but the highest in the world .
in the middle of the <unk> islands , the man has <unk> in hamburg and the rest of europe is the largest largest <unk> of the cartoons of cartoons .
so men and death can decide .
but you 're also the other .
on the left of the left <unk> , the right on the right , my <unk> .
the highest world .
and over the point of where i 'm just a vacuum , and i personally personally .
and then i took all the <unk> .
it started the conference .
and under our frill on the left of left , from egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of the egypt , egypt , <unk> mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much to the subject , islam is not <unk> .
we had medical school students to <unk> their way , which is terrible , you know , the <unk> , you know , the <unk> .
and then , they had to show her film , <unk> .
reality .
men were wet eyes .
they were back behind <unk> doors to two hours , and she had to write a <unk> , a <unk> .
the <unk> in front of the cameras , announced what you 've chosen .
and the most important sentence in it , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime in the highest values of islam .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought that was done , but the bill had done without our <unk> .
because the shame , about the abdomen of the woman is stronger than anybody understood .
that 's why we have <unk> .
we 've got this conference in this called golden book .
one <unk> for the world 's <unk> .
and because the <unk> , the <unk> , it 's so good , it 's got it with a <unk> .
it 's going to be torn from the hands .
we were in many countries to work with the <unk> in the top of the world .
and they were reading the interest in the interest , so it was so excited about it , you 've got ta have the book .
but , unfortunately , most of the courage to get to say , too .
you 're not going to talk about the abdomen of the woman in the mosque .
just some of the <unk> have been upset .
they were at least in the universities , on <unk> .
and sometimes we 've found some bold <unk> , actually , in the mosque , you know , how to have this one .
and then it goes through <unk> <unk> .
and these are the subjects .
they 're going to spread .
but i 'm going to get the time .
it 's all <unk> on hot stones , and so , this is what i work on a lot of things , this subject .
it 's a practice .
but my favorite , this is the case of this .
i want to say the great message of the world 's largest <unk> of the world , which is , in the fall of islam in the kaaba , in the kaaba .
not in so <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
when there are four million people together come together , men and women are the islamic currents .
and i then <unk> with all of the <unk> and the <unk> king , with the <unk> <unk> .
i 've got this in the <unk> .
but unfortunately , the last <unk> , that would be king .
but i 'm sure if he would be on this guy , he would come to come from .
for one to help these women .
for other , to show the world , which is the true values of islam , rather than just <unk> .
the terrorists as a <unk> .
if i do n't do that , and i may say that i could n't have this , what in hamburg , is all the first time .
so at least , at least many <unk> in the mosques in the world .
and we could have a transparent .
and maybe i may still have to be that little girl has to have his daughters , not to get more .
and then my life has been the equivalent of it .
and i want to say , i want to say , you know , i want to have to have a person who 's heard of it , and you 've got to have to join me .
and not on the end of the <unk> , not a <unk> .
we need to get a practice in the ton , and there 's no one of this stage again .
and now i want to show you the design of my <unk> .
this is my favorite , my <unk> .
and this is in all <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
there 's the bottom , we also have it in german .
female <unk> is incompatible with the koran and the ethics of islam .
she 's <unk> and a discrimination of the islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm going to start with this .
so the <unk> looked like that , which you 've got to be in germany .
at the <unk> , my mother , my brother , my brother , and i 'll put a package of a package .
<unk> <unk> .
my mom was completely horrified , because they did n't know why they 've been offering us now .
the third day we 've been trained .
and we were able to get the trash , then they were getting away a little bit of <unk> , and she had a <unk> woman and <unk> that 's just <unk> in <unk> .
she tried to explain that you can go to food .
that 's not a <unk> .
and that tastes really good .
it 's cheese .
my mom moved to the eyebrow and we laughed .
cheese .
in my country , we have a goat <unk> , but it did n't smell so much as <unk> .
i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
fifteen years ago , i am my mom and my brother from china to china .
from this <unk> , i 'm telling you today .
but mostly , it 's about me to be the people who allowed these <unk> and have done a success story .
but first , i first tell you where i 'm from .
i 'm a <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , which is in the northwest of china .
and this region is called the chinese .
it 's about <unk> miles away from germany .
china is in china , 10 million <unk> , but in <unk> , the largest <unk> community outside the china .
and this <unk> life that 's why there 's because we have to be suffering from the symptoms of parallel <unk> .
hundreds of china became extra <unk> to <unk> to our own home , in our own home ,
our own language , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
in schools and in universities , they 're only taught in the schools .
and our religion is not to act as well .
the <unk> are losing their culture and identity .
and when someone 's bold is , for the rights of the <unk> , long as long as a long time , or even death or even death .
that was also the reason why my parents decided to escape , with the kids .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this is a little bit of our escape .
we had n't enough money , so that had been to be a parent back .
i 'm involved in a lot of people who helped us in the escape .
i 'm betting me in a lot of images .
but i 'm looking at all the <unk> <unk> , but i first have a <unk> .
i <unk> it to me , when i <unk> my eyes .
he was big at a <unk> , and we got a lot of <unk> in a parking lot .
the first one is , the first one .
i know a bad picture of <unk> <unk> have a negative image that the businesses are doing in <unk> refugees and not interested in order to the fates .
but i 'm <unk> , i call him <unk> , not as a <unk> .
because <unk> has brought us months .
he stood on the airport in <unk> in <unk> in a <unk> , and he was able to <unk> the last conclusion , whether we really had it all of the <unk> .
airport airport , we came up , and i know how my mother somehow said to me out of the airport .
do n't you say .
until we 're out .
because i had a pass , and there was my photograph in the way there was a <unk> name , <unk> .
i had to be a <unk> .
and i 'm <unk> in <unk> <unk> , who had my passport in the hand .
silence .
sweat .
a long look .
we were finally <unk> .
in <unk> , <unk> , i was involved in many <unk> who had somehow been very supported by a very much .
i 'm <unk> in the <unk> woman who have used to be used in the <unk> .
in a <unk> , four <unk> per <unk> of 13 families .
at least , the kids are .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was foreign faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to share a <unk> .
there was eaten , and i did n't made my homework .
friends have not come to me because i was <unk> where we were .
just my <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> knew , '' had been known .
she had my story , and they had very <unk> and they were <unk> .
for example , for example , she took me to me <unk> me , what i do n't do .
but they did n't work to meet german <unk> <unk> .
i spent my whole bunch of subjects in the <unk> .
it was not just for my mother .
with each other alone , without having to their man , and in the uncertainty of the uncertainty , because we had a <unk> , and could n't be a <unk> and could n't be a little bit .
i 'm betting me that i was very , very , very aggressive .
it 's also a little bit of embarrassing that now all of you , but now i have to be just to just stand up .
i was very aggressive , and i could be very bad at school .
and the <unk> took us a little bit of the catholic , where we had to have a first time to be a little bit of regular kids to be .
i mean , i was like normal , i had to live in a <unk> .
i also <unk> myself to the <unk> and i sent to my brother or <unk> .
just it all of us .
i also <unk> myself in several <unk> of <unk> to us , because our parents could n't have german .
or they 're just going to do this , right ?
we always have very happy .
i know how we were looking at the fence and waited until these people , because , somehow , the way , they took away from us to us , and that was important to us .
after two years , my father finally came to germany .
but the problem was that he was going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> , because it did n't find a place in <unk> .
i 'm looking at the very , very <unk> , who made it done , my father to preserve the <unk> of the <unk> to protect china to make it was even made it in <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm betting myself in this time where i really have very , very happy , because after six years , we had to move into a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we finally had a own apartment with a personal and a personal kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was very small , and i had no desk in there , but it was good , i could get my door .
and i 'm <unk> myself , i 've been used to have a lot of good , but i had to leave the <unk> <unk> without a degree .
i really have a perspective on me .
there was a <unk> that has been supported me and still had a lot of the idea that i do , and it 's got to do it in the second , which i can get over the second , the <unk> <unk> .
first of the <unk> , the <unk> .
so i was very much the teachers who really believed me , and i was really not just too easy to the time , i even made it to the middle <unk> .
and after i came to the <unk> .
and before i was playing with the <unk> , i was playing with my best friend <unk> .
<unk> is a organization or a project of organized organized .
but i was n't a good <unk> that i 've been doing that because we had a place where we could just go to a place where we could just go .
we had a <unk> , which we had our <unk> <unk> .
and the ladder of <unk> helped us have to tell us our problems , and he was public and could work and could be a way of asking us in all questions .
and after , i got to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people without a conclusion , who have a conversation with a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
so that really was really done , and i realized that art is something like me , and i realized something like me .
by <unk> and the encounter , a filmmaker came up to us .
he made the film <unk> over my friends and me .
and the movie won many prices .
we realized that people were interested in our story .
he was a very special feeling because we 've never experienced that people had heard us .
and that was a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to be more <unk> .
i want to make something from my life .
a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> <unk> for me to join me to a <unk> to me to join me to a <unk> .
but there 's a <unk> building , i 'd never had a <unk> of a <unk> for a piece of play , and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was right .
i played .
and the great thing is that after a performance of two editors , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i had wondered , if i had a interest in a way to make your own <unk> .
i thought , great , <unk> .
i 'm going to see that .
and i made a <unk> <unk> , now , in a pulse of <unk> and a <unk> in my parts of a piece of <unk> , where i was placed in the european <unk> .
and i 've actually won him .
now , i study in college , and i 've been <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i 'm a <unk> <unk> .
and that would n't be done for me , if not only if not a single or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> or projects like <unk> , like <unk> , for me , and i would have been used to me for me .
you 've got to have been open , and they 've opened me together , they 've shown me ways how i could have my place in society .
and i 'm going to come to you now .
everybody 's the possibility of them , and you know , the possibility of people like me to get a lot of the world , and you find your life or your place in society .
because , people , every single hundred refugees come from <unk> , and every single one of them are filled with hope and everyone of them have a big potential .
they have it a lot of determination to leave you a lot of terrible hurdles .
and with this determination , you could really be a big deal for germany , and for each one of us .
and i could have a thousand things , which is you can do , but i could n't have enough time , even though there 's a minute of a minute i brought a <unk> .
now , you get your cell phone out , you ca n't tell me that you ca n't have a code .
scan the code , and then you come on the side of <unk> with a lot of incentives , which they can do .
and that would be all very much help .
i 'm going to be now in your engagement and we 're going to see us out there .
and they scan the code .
i mean , `` it 's the <unk> . ''
many , a lot of you have not in your hand .
are you so happy , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> .
just a <unk> <unk> , i mean ,
okay , you know , i 'm going to talk to you .
my name is robin .
my <unk> is , writes to make simple easier than it talks .
i 'm coming from austria , in vienna .
i 'm glad i 'm too much , today , today , is really beautiful in <unk> .
i 'm very much of the time every time .
and that 's not a phrase , that 's a sense .
yes , yeah , in contrast , i 'm not going to talk to the other <unk> , i 'm not here today to <unk> you about anything .
i did n't know what .
it 's so , it 's why i write the text in my spare and then , and then this is a place where there 's talk about <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
yeah , and i was also asked today , a few texts to read a little bit of <unk> the entire program .
and that 's what i 'm going to do is now .
yes .
i start with a joke .
meet two chickens .
so that 's one of the things that are two english chickens i 'm <unk> , and so i do n't <unk> out , but <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> me to you , and i 'm going to be <unk> and <unk> in <unk> .
`` i 'm saying that other people .
hey , i 'm going to be <unk> <unk> me .
so , here we have the level of data .
the first text is a little bit of <unk> , which i wrote .
i got to get a person to one person who 's partly what means .
it 's wearing the title .
and she did n't understand it in the time .
when your head in my lap , your rest were in my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling was outside the ceiling .
my leg was in the ceiling .
it 's about your own head , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the rest of my lap , the rest of her face , my leg also under the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling .
this has been <unk> , when my leg had very much very long .
it was very romantic .
the next text i also got to a person who 's very important to me .
and that 's my grandpa .
we have no contact of any more .
my <unk> grandfather was made of the job .
and there 's been a kid with love <unk> .
i 'm just like this , yeah .
yes , there 's a <unk> text .
better , not .
jesus is the only <unk> is on the <unk> of the bus .
but where was he as though he was going to save the <unk> of the <unk> ?
so are we thinking ?
did i have my <unk> ?
next text .
the next one is a little bit more .
he 's actually a second .
so to write .
read now , the faster .
is the beginning of a novel i write a degree of <unk> .
ah , it 's about <unk> guy , so the adventure from a guy who always <unk> the hair and a little bit more <unk> .
but i 'm still looking at the same way of this point of the <unk> of the <unk> .
because i 'm not going to be the hairs .
chapter one .
if i get <unk> , my head is empty .
so empty as the slate , so it 's trying to fill it .
yeah , i 'm not going to come .
very hard a year , a half a second .
the next text is also a little bit of <unk> .
most people do n't understand it .
i do n't do it .
and that 's what i 'm going to get is , i want to play with my vocabulary and with my language .
i 've always liked to be playing with me .
and yes , then , you get out , are going to get things out .
it 's wearing the title .
and there 's a little bit strange yet .
maybe that 's the <unk> <unk> that i 've ever wrote .
<unk> , we can .
yes , we 're <unk> .
we can .
we <unk> .
but i 'm not going to ca n't here .
but i can .
i do n't know .
i do n't do it .
yes , i did n't understand .
no idea .
yeah , yeah , <unk> <unk> .
i always tell you , either or no one .
the next piece of doing , and it has to do with text .
it 's kind of a little bit of <unk> .
i wrote the same thing to insects .
very polite .
yes , there 's a <unk> text .
is a little turret .
and that 's what it 's all cool when i do that , you know , that you might say that you might say three .
my text wearing the title , all good things are cool .
so , in order , there 's <unk> dry .
we have <unk> <unk> .
so , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and scratch , and then , it 's going to be better and yes , and it 's it .
nice moment .
yes , <unk> <unk> , this is another one .
and that 's all cool , when i do it all of all , we could make all of these kinds of <unk> , so that 's all the time we all try to do it .
right , so , what the wind is going to do .
the text is wearing the title , and so the <unk> is .
yes .
power is for you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write so , `` i like to do so little <unk> .
this is a <unk> <unk> slide .
<unk> is called <unk> s .
s s ?
yes , yeah .
power is for you .
yes , <unk> sentence .
it 's written in <unk> .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's going to be impossible to explain , <unk> in <unk> , that 's the point .
here 's another text .
this day is a <unk> .
it 's the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he had known it before i 've had it as a <unk> .
he was <unk> me , and he would put me <unk> .
i could get me later in him later .
i made him the delight .
it was made as a <unk> and made me in all other days and put me back .
with a <unk> , in the face where else else ?
and it 's not to make it more to write him by <unk> .
and i should be a blog , and i could n't have a <unk> day , and i 've just traded a <unk> day .
there is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what 's einstein 's design , when his steak did n't liked ?
i 'm betting .
so .
you may sound like the cow like the cow .
that 's why it 's funny .
yeah , the next text has also learned the paper .
it 's rather than political .
so , i do n't write a funny thing .
i also write a very political things .
and i 'm going to get a kind of <unk> , i 'm often asked where i 'm going to do .
and , yeah , i 've got a saying that text here .
he 's wearing the title .
my father came from vienna , then in my mother and i was from her .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yeah , i 'd like to do a little bit of advertising .
i ca n't do business or so , so i have to make it all the way to make it .
and i 'm also <unk> in the same way , and i also make a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
let 's like to come .
and yes , i 'm <unk> , i 'm actually really <unk> .
and , yes .
i 'm just like to say .
it 's going on in the program .
more advertising .
this is a little commercials i wrote .
feet .
rich , of <unk> c .
so the <unk> .
`` north , of course .
it 's very funny .
i want to write a joke about your girlfriend 's friend , but the <unk> was just flat .
yeah , is n't a little bit of <unk> .
<unk> , you 're killing you , the <unk> <unk> , you 're offering you to <unk> the <unk> of it .
yes .
thank you for listening .
you 've been great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me just start with a <unk> question .
why is you going to do it in the way ?
i think everybody who would be asking for the tax tax tax , whether it 's a moment of a moment of society , and then give you to give up what
and the answer is quite clear .
we know that the life expectancy is the way of the time of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of
it 's called it , there 's no environmental , <unk> policies , and that 's how to have the impact on the <unk> .
so why do we know so little ?
why are we covered by <unk> news from the <unk> , who are opposed to each other ?
you remember , and we 've found the guilty of the guilty .
it was fat .
and you thought , if you look at fat from the food , we 're all <unk> and will be healthy .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves on the different <unk> and <unk> in american <unk> , and what did n't changed that , the americans are become larger than the americans .
then you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
what 's what the <unk> of the <unk> who has led to the <unk> and so forth .
so it 's always <unk> new <unk> <unk> through the ground .
how all the <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , for at least , for at least , for at least , for at least , for at least , for at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , we have to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
for example , for a <unk> , there 's one .
you know , you know , all the <unk> , you know .
<unk> published a lot of a <unk> magazine in a new <unk> .
the top <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith <unk> had gone on the country in the ground .
then the newspaper died .
or this lady here .
<unk> <unk> .
the oldest person who has lived in the earth 's largest in earth .
<unk> , <unk> .
i know there 's people who claim you , they 're six , but not find their <unk> .
jean <unk> has become <unk> .
and she heard with <unk> <unk> , but then , with <unk> , to the path of virtue of virtue and stop <unk> .
and then , with <unk> , it 's died .
what does that tell us ?
not that cigarettes are healthy .
but it says , aging is that aging is very complicated , and that we need clean statistics , we need a little bit of <unk> , we need to ask a simple <unk> .
so , a simple question , and a very simple thing , and a very simple thing , the way of things that are in different countries , women are being used to be older than men .
what is that ?
we 've seen it .
so that 's the average of the <unk> , which is produced in the male <unk> .
and there 's <unk> proof of the way that men are going to be very , just as men .
now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , you can consider each other for yourself , whether it 's a <unk> <unk> .
austria is a force .
but there are better tips , there 's no fear .
it 's not going to confuse us context with <unk> .
sound complicated , but it 's easy to illustrate a normal way .
so there 's somebody <unk> <unk> and asks what do you do so different or anything that they were so old ?
ah .
the oma has 10 cigarettes every day .
that 's the secret of your age , right ?
and you have the 10 cigarettes , maybe not just <unk> .
or you have <unk> and the oma would be without the 10 cigarettes .
even hard statistics are not always <unk> .
for example , for example , is serious hard , which is that showing people who are <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> , who are not getting older than people who do n't do that .
do n't .
is <unk> .
is that the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's about that people just just had enough money in the pocket of her in your pocket , and the <unk> diseases of the age of the disease .
but if i give a group of <unk> , and then , these group had a food system , and then spent six percent more than a <unk> <unk> , but otherwise , but otherwise , i would have been a very much factor of being a factor of the diet .
and in fact , these attempts have been done .
you have to say , `` the <unk> is very <unk> , but even i agree with my enemies , but that 's the <unk> are <unk> .
and this works for a little bit of different organisms .
for example , at bacteria .
you see a <unk> <unk> of bacteria .
when we were the <unk> , in the <unk> line , the <unk> is a bit more .
the same is true of the <unk> , predators , flies , fly and recently , only happened two years ago , in the united states , in the united states , that there 's even for monkeys .
it 's not about being a thin .
it 's also working with the <unk> <unk> .
and this is another experiment , which has been done in the united states .
what did you have done here ?
you 've taken a <unk> <unk> , and the so-called <unk> call <unk> , a <unk> diet , so you have a <unk> diet , so many <unk> and night , and night .
and who 's what i 'm talking about , who did n't have thick , getting sick and have a lot of bad <unk> and bad <unk> .
now you 've taken a sophisticated parallel <unk> , and the only thing has been <unk> by the same number of <unk> only that , in fact , in a <unk> .
they have no food that have no food that has fallen twice as much .
and these <unk> is <unk> and healthy and they did n't have a <unk> .
although both mice were feeding .
both have a lot of eaten .
a sick and the other healthy .
what 's happening there ?
it 's going to be a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
whenever they 're going to take organisms , or cells , the organism starts to take the organism , <unk> <unk> , <unk> compounds in the cell or <unk> compounds to make energy back .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how the cell is actually <unk> , mainly , in order to be <unk> , the age of the age .
the <unk> of the stomach that the blood are <unk> and the cell as the energy to make the energy .
and by the age of damage in the age of the age , in the end of the age .
this is really the molecular <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , to <unk> it <unk> , <unk> <unk> are <unk> living in different organisms .
and it 's probably not paying attention that it works in humans .
and we learn from that , not like to recommend in <unk> , every little <unk> are battling the day of six months .
no .
but you 're supposed to say , if you have hunger , ah , maybe it 's just the <unk> turned on .
you welcome your hunger like a friend .
and that 's also making sense of meaning .
in fact , as a point of <unk> , nine nine percent of human history has the human history , what did n't have done when he had hunger ?
right , he went to be <unk> .
we 're going to get into the fridge , if we have hunger .
and that 's safe in the biology .
now , of course , we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> <unk> , who 's ready to be ready , but the meat is weak .
paradise looks very different .
here 's already a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> garden .
the three <unk> here is all right now , the food all day , and they 're going to give up .
and this is kind of the <unk> .
so we 've done the search for one-dimensional , which is the molecular response of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the animal even though .
this could be interesting to people whose <unk> are not enough to be <unk> .
and maybe we could protect us from the hardest most difficult <unk> of life .
so the question is , so we can <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , even though you eat ?
and we have a lot of hundred , the thousand component of <unk> , natural component .
we 've found a found that is called <unk> .
<unk> is a substance of something that 's in all organisms , but also in all organisms .
it 's the skin in the skin .
people have less <unk> in the skin as a <unk> .
and if we 're going to give <unk> in human cells , for example , you see here .
that 's a serious cell in the same .
is the <unk> , the nucleus of the <unk> , and we see a lot of thousands of these little <unk> in the cell , which is the crap in the age of the age .
and they would be in the same way , which is very much like that .
and this works in all different organisms .
so , here 's a <unk> show , for example .
so we found a sophisticated substance that the molecular <unk> <unk> <unk> .
life because organisms also do it again .
and the answer is , you see , you see , you see a typical <unk> in a <unk> .
it 's simple <unk> .
after <unk> days , the dead are dead , after stealing days , about half of these days , half of the days of days .
whenever we give up in the drinking water , there 's a little bit of all the animals and survival .
we also know that human cells that we have from <unk> <unk> <unk> , in culture , are at three times as long as long as we have <unk> .
and latest research in the <unk> , <unk> research also has been able to be done by the whole life of <unk> .
and it 's not just the life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now , you want to know where is <unk> coming ?
as the name says , it 's been found in sperm , there 's a very high levels of it .
but i can <unk> them mad , too much <unk> <unk> , and a product of <unk> <unk> , which is true in japan , which is so <unk> <unk> 's much more <unk> .
so we said , we 'd say , if you do n't have to help <unk> <unk> by <unk> , then it might be able to be <unk> in the late <unk> ?
and you have to know that the common denominator of all the <unk> diseases are that the old <unk> of the human brain in the brain is in the brain .
and we did experiments in the fact .
you 're going to be wonder , we 've done the flies of fruit flies .
and then fruit flies are also <unk> when they 're old .
they have more <unk> in the brain when they 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are also in memory , are very similar to people .
now , you 're asking , how the devil has measured the memory of fruit flies ?
this is the experiment we have in <unk> <unk> <unk> of the university berlin .
they take a hundred fruit flies and <unk> the shoes , which you get a smell , which you love .
<unk> .
and let 's go back in this <unk> <unk> .
then you take the same room , give you in the next board , and give you other things that you love , which is <unk> .
we 're going to enjoy the <unk> , but it 's a serious <unk> .
ma <unk> .
and then you take the same way up and fly .
the drive here are still <unk> in the <unk> , there 's the way you see .
and when you 're there , they give up from one side of the <unk> and <unk> of other side .
where do all the rest go ?
and sure .
for <unk> .
except that two .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , you have character .
i love my <unk> , and i do n't do with such a <unk> reward .
okay .
but is a big form of character that 's age with age .
not just flying .
and we could actually fly the <unk> of flying into <unk> , to a <unk> , <unk> , very much .
and the <unk> , which was led to the brain , they were animal .
that means , <unk> does n't just be just against aging , but also against <unk> diseases , maybe .
and that 's important because we want to do n't the <unk> increase in the civil war in the civil war .
it does n't make sense of the time of the <unk> .
and i do n't want to leave you , without you even give you a few more practical tips , we might potentially get younger .
again , <unk> <unk> .
it 's not about the way you were going to be reduced or so .
there 's a lot of people in austria , in austria , there 's a day of <unk> people who eat a day and nothing .
this is the so-called <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the very good thing .
that 's called it , it 's <unk> .
avoid <unk> .
it 's not about carbs , but it 's not very dangerous .
it 's really about candy .
you know , you know that <unk> are sufficient , to say , diabetes , even if you 're <unk> .
and you also know that sugar can be faster , and there 's the growth of tumors .
so , you see , there 's a <unk> , which is <unk> .
after 30 days , the dead are dead .
very low <unk> of glucose from the glucose .
to create a <unk> effect .
there 's just one example that works in almost all organisms .
they regularly eat fruit and vegetables .
avoid the gift of too much more <unk> or <unk> .
you know , you know , that <unk> are being shared .
it 's not under the circumstances of vitamin d .
we 're a level of level of the winter , in the winter , and it 's called vitamin d is in the dark .
some of them , you know , three times a week , so that 's trivial .
cigarettes , <unk> <unk> , they have 10 to 10 to four times .
do you even get a <unk> of the eternal <unk> , the quiet <unk> .
the influence of praying and blood pressure on the life expectancy is actually recent .
because the monks of the world is almost like women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , life longer longer than <unk> .
<unk> life longer than <unk> .
but <unk> lives still still live than <unk> .
just <unk> , the way to dying as a <unk> .
what is that ?
people assume that has to do what to do with some of the substances .
no way , no way that 's simple , it 's simple .
now , when there 's a <unk> <unk> , then i 'm going to go down the window , i 'm going to go on the <unk> solution .
and what 's what happens probably looks like in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what , are <unk> in <unk> circumstances .
so alcohol , it 's <unk> <unk> .
a tough partner has a hard partner or a lot of family , with longevity .
you should n't live a lot of the <unk> street .
now you think about it , right ?
but that 's not something that has nothing to do with <unk> .
it 's about <unk> .
you can have to measure a closer place on a much <unk> street , the more <unk> in blood .
and that 's what if he says , i 've got to find out of it .
i can go in all right and the noise does n't do anything .
not true .
he 's still <unk> in blood and this is bad .
so sunlight should be powered by natural forces of natural .
we 've now know that <unk> is very good , very good metabolic effects .
mostly it can lower the <unk> .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice are not protecting against <unk> .
and the idea of the way we knew how to have a grandmothers , and we 've got to have a <unk> service , and so on the way .
not not a sense of sense .
several studies show that dark chocolate can be <unk> against dementia .
just recently , a nice study , which showed that a <unk> is dark , a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> one day , the <unk> of a <unk> .
and the same thing you want to be in coffee is the data but a thinner .
there are studies that show you , there 's studies that do n't show .
what 's what is , is that coffee is <unk> in diabetes and so their metabolic performance improved .
and in the way , is also a good thing , and it 's also a good <unk> , because it could show up with <unk> <unk> in paris .
so a very nice nice and <unk> study had been studied for a hundred thousand people long , have shown that people who are <unk> , they were <unk> <unk> kids to have their <unk> ,
this is a huge value for serious study .
and this applies to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not , not the <unk> , right ?
and there 's just <unk> , by looking at these , okay ?
but that 's not right .
so , you ca n't have the dials .
the next point is a little bit more difficult .
they avoid the recording of the <unk> , so of meat and dairy , but only when they 're between <unk> and <unk> years .
so a very nice new study shows you , when you take a lot of animal protein , you take a lot of animal protein , they 're going to increase your <unk> protein , as they would be a strong one .
that 's not for time where the animal proteins are all , and it 's not for <unk> kids , or adolescents who need to proteins and do n't be dead and do it .
they do n't get <unk> .
whatever you do , you 're going to be <unk> , and the <unk> nietzsche , who said , `` the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of health .
all <unk> is in the medical school .
this is the gentleman called the <unk> <unk> , and he lived in this regime , and he 's been <unk> years old .
he comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never getting sick .
and he 's very good .
it 's not a <unk> <unk> , but he 's not living in a <unk> , where there 's a lot of healthy <unk> .
he followed about the <unk> , which i told you today .
we should have been missing a lot of things that we have n't been missing in terms of a lot of important fact , but not not .
and that 's the <unk> of the <unk> of me not , a <unk> , but then , it 's a <unk> .
you know , you 're less less less less than that , and could be one of the most popular mistake of our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel of the <unk> , a year ago .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece of work on the contemporary critic of all the teenage <unk> <unk> .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question i 'm going to do .
one question , where do n't you have to get up because it 's a little bit of a <unk> who is lonely ?
but the <unk> is very little .
low as i thought .
but it probably has no reasons why they did n't have been reported , and they have to people who have a very hard thing to be <unk> .
many people do <unk> and loneliness and you might think that would be <unk> .
and that 's not the case .
now , in fact , in particular , you 're actually going to be a phenomenon of people in the way .
maybe it 's also because it 's not that you do n't have signed because the question is <unk> the <unk> .
you feel like a lonely , or is you lonely ?
you can feel lonely without being a lonely .
and you can be a lonely feeling without feeling like the moment .
and loneliness is also too much to do with shame .
also , also , this is also going to be done with <unk> to loneliness .
loneliness is in shame and shame in loneliness .
loneliness is , in time .
and so there 's no reported here now , there 's no reported in the few seconds that i gave them .
loneliness is not going to have <unk> .
in loneliness , the time , to be aware of their minds .
and loneliness is also , too , it 's also making it , too .
and this exercise is not all of all of them .
we do n't have the language yet , and we have to realize the signs of ourselves , when are we lonely ?
there 's not the loneliness to two <unk> that i 've ever encountered .
one part of humanity says , it 's from a start .
from birth to death , you actually have a lonely .
there are a few moments of where you can see the <unk> .
these people are often going to go to <unk> and drive all day .
i do n't have time to be so your <unk> .
and then there 's people who are less high , who says everything is connected .
i 'm not really , so i 'm just one part of the big universe .
and there 's the big group of the group that i also have the most part of the same one , so that 's so thinking .
the idea , okay , today i am lonely and the next day , and it 's all about each other together .
when we 're at loneliness , and we 're always going to think about the first of the most big loneliness .
the loneliness of the <unk> , the loneliness to the <unk> of a intensive care .
but over this <unk> , over this great <unk> <unk> , i do n't talk to you today , but i want to talk about the little , where loneliness to be in such a theater .
i do n't want to talk about burden and <unk> of the <unk> .
loneliness to other people , most of us not find not hard to us in our asthma risk .
photographer christine <unk> <unk> did a few photos i want to show you .
how easy it is always going to be too dark , in other loneliness .
and we do n't know if these people felt really lonely in this moment .
but who do n't know what the moment is that the moment of the <unk> event , where you think you think all of you , you 're just something lost in the corner and has no one .
these all of all , in the sudden , in <unk> , you know , all right now .
maybe some you might have experienced today .
what you do is to do it , you do n't look like this , and you see the mobile phone , but you could see the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> on the cell phone , and the <unk> on the cell phone .
clearly , when you look at the display .
what we do n't do here now .
yes , and then there 's the loneliness , which is not in a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , hundreds of <unk> faces in front of the <unk> faces , and you 're not just left to hope that you do n't forget your text .
these are the <unk> that you see from the outside .
we give people to people .
but i 'm sure there 's a human being in the room who are attracted to a while , who are trained their life so spent so spent so spent by the whole life by trying to get these loneliness .
and there 's also sure that you 're still telling people who are also telling people who are lonely , because they have to give you a different person , it 's because of the death of a <unk> .
there 's nothing that it 's not even more than so many people , also , people who are connected to them , they 're all of feeling lonely .
and there are people who have lost that , not to find any part of a contact , and are so lonely .
i 'm betting the digital loneliness .
and you 're going to fall down to the <unk> loneliness .
the analog loneliness is not familiar .
these are people who have to find out of their opinion , there 's no matter of social contacts .
and that 's also a relative .
there 's no official number , no <unk> number , when someone 's good user , when not .
and we 're going to get the old people up there ,
it 's the <unk> form of loneliness .
since since we have all in cities , and we have a lot of people in facebook or facebook , or facebook , it 's got to be bigger and more loneliness .
you can be connected with hundreds of people without being connected to a single person .
it 's not at the analog to the analog of human relationships , which is missing in the digital loneliness to the information .
the two forms of loneliness are very often in the low range of themselves .
that 's also that , the analog loneliness is not a little bit of <unk> in a little bit of <unk> .
whereas digital loneliness is good for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's the <unk> of the digital loneliness in the future , when you get more likely to get the opportunities to connect , it 's bigger .
i do n't know if you 're in six years of this sense of the <unk> of loneliness to not quite similar , not in the end of you .
or if you find a new term , then you find a new term .
but these are also the issues of the <unk> generation .
almost greater than loneliness , the fear of loneliness and from this fear of loneliness are not to do people happy .
<unk> , the big <unk> , also a <unk> person , a wonderful person , <unk> wrote a wonderful <unk> .
in the act of what people are doing , what people do all to do n't do to be alone .
they build cathedrals , they 're witnesses who then were lonely and in the same .
but the <unk> did n't have named <unk> to <unk> the fear of loneliness , which is money .
<unk> go .
things be in .
both of the things that 's happening in the frozen range of loneliness , because it 's at least a touch , as well , the objects of the things that are also a touch as well as you have some of these images .
but there 's just just that it helps us and think this <unk> <unk> against loneliness .
so we have to buy new things , and we have to buy new things .
i 've seen the commercials for a <unk> panties , and i 've seen a <unk> panties .
and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from mobile communication with the idea of it .
what that 's doing is to do with your panties , you do n't know , but it 's also actually work .
so loneliness is not in the <unk> , because of the people who has n't in humans , right .
<unk> <unk> wrote a wonderful poem , and there 's a verse that 's <unk> to <unk> .
hand on the heart , who knows that ?
in a relationship or looking at the other or the other hand , and all of the sudden , are being feeling too , and i 've got a very bad parent in feeling , and ask , to feel bad and ask the question that is that person actually do ?
i have to do with something ?
one study says that in the <unk> women , who 's got to get over the <unk> of the <unk> , married , with kids , feel .
so , this is missing , because i do n't know , if i was invented in the study of the study , i 've invented it so often .
but it 's also not matter because it 's mostly in studies at the research , and response is the response to me , and that 's always the same thing that people are in front of me .
that the normal thing is , it 's kind of of of of of of of of of of you , almost a <unk> .
in loneliness to <unk> , every <unk> and still do n't talk about it .
talk about the <unk> of loneliness .
it 's probably the idea of all of us .
and while you see , all of the sudden , suddenly , what i think is , what do i do here ?
who is this person in my bed ?
also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , the shape of loneliness to do n't necessarily have to do with the quality of the <unk> .
but nothing also has to have to do with the quality of the quality .
it 's just always there .
we 're just talking about them because we do n't look at it .
we 're just not going to talk about it in the workforce .
in the workforce , loneliness is too <unk> as we think .
i stood up with <unk> <unk> and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better , three remarks suit , and two led <unk> .
the two men have taught who have two women in the face .
and in between , something <unk> , something like this is a little bit more <unk> in the hand of the <unk> .
i think i have to do you to do the scene in the top of loneliness , and there 's even more in the workforce in the workforce .
it 's the loneliness of the <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness of the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , maybe there 's a few times of these lives in the <unk> .
in <unk> , in hotels , in hotels , in hotels , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , they 're <unk> who do n't know , you know , they do n't know who they actually do , what they 're doing .
where you 're going to wake up .
it 's a form of loneliness , not spoken about that .
just as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> is parallel .
i told me a <unk> , and i told you that he wrote from a clients , and the said , it 's what happens to you , you ca n't imagine it .
a <unk> was in the state alone .
so he 's got to the <unk> .
and two months later , he 's also <unk> <unk> .
and loneliness is never going to be alone .
she 's always going to be connected with other emotion .
she 's nice siblings , and she has ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings we all know .
fear , grief of everlasting despair and shame .
but we should not forget the beautiful siblings .
the freedom of the pride is the desire to the <unk> .
so my plea is to look at the loneliness .
come and goes in the lives like the tide and the tide .
let 's go and let me <unk> her .
because there 's some more worse than loneliness and that 's the empty , which may be more likely to fall out if you do n't really feel more .
loneliness is part of life .
since i 've been thinking about loneliness , have been really changed for me for me to me .
one in my <unk> , i was not going to have a <unk> <unk> , and i realized that i did n't have a <unk> , because he did n't get <unk> because i 've got to lose me , maybe i 'd like to get a <unk> .
i 've been able to have been able to have been able to have the loneliness since i was accepted in my life , and let me go .
that 's what it is with the <unk> that you do .
i 've got it all the free .
people get to go and go to the way they could n't immediately immediately <unk> , whether it was a <unk> or a friendship or a partnership .
as a kid , i found my parents , incredibly embarrassing .
you can not have a conversation with no one <unk> without someone to do with someone .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
each time , it led to be <unk> talks .
as a kid , i found the way of being told .
and as a young adult , i 've been documenting it to make these openness to this openness .
but only since i 've been doing this in college , i 'm going to go to me at least , and i 'm also going to go to open up and open up .
you see it 's being saved for a game .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i 've got three instances of this .
a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now , i 'm asking you , if you have a bright <unk> , you know , you would take your pants ?
most of them would choose to choose to choose the <unk> .
and that 's a very good idea .
and why ?
because we 're dealing with the most precious effect on the most important effect .
in health , we do it kind of different .
and so let 's work with the largest effect , except for eight and decide for other strategies .
for example , we choose to be a <unk> and the <unk> .
big <unk> , but of the effort .
so i do n't mean , so that 's not so valuable .
or we decide , we 're going to choose to the <unk> .
it 's diet .
but also very large , big <unk> , and still have a lot of effort .
so i do n't have that that important .
and i want to tell you today how you make the most effort that are the largest <unk> of the world .
when you get engaged and health , you get to get a topic of a subject .
and the theme is called the obesity .
and the topic is now , in germany , a topic , so much in the <unk> .
and then the number of overweight overweight in germany has a lot of overweight .
and i asked me , what was going to go in the <unk> ?
so why did i <unk> up to the top ?
and i 've got a study of research and i grew up too <unk> .
because it was in the years of <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> , germany .
and we are always going to be more and more .
and i watched looking at a look .
<unk> comes from germany to germany .
and the obesity increase .
and in the years , the curve is still going to be right now .
and what 's coming up ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how it 's called everything .
and we are always going to be more and more .
well , i got one and a <unk> .
because it was obvious .
sports : dick .
and of course , i 'm not here today , to tell you that sports is thick .
because that 's not true .
but one of the things we have in common .
the tide of new training , and they did n't have to be that we did n't have to be able to be <unk> and healthier .
so what is it so ?
diet ?
and there 's a lot of great study in the states .
the problem with syndrome .
and they 've launched in the <unk> <unk> .
and then they wanted to look at what 's happening here ?
and they 've seen people are actually less fat , but they 're still getting less calories , but still , in spite of a lot of calories , but it 's still a lot .
and that was paradox .
and so they 've called it called <unk> .
we can explain this ?
there 's a way to introduce you to the body like a power station .
there 's so serious <unk> .
and on a page , a <unk> comes , there 's all the <unk> , which is going to get here .
and here is the energy <unk> as electricity .
but if we 're going to give up more <unk> in our power plant than we use on the other side , we use the energy in power and it 's got bang .
the human body does n't be the same .
the energy can store .
and that 's in a <unk> of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
but what happens is what happens less like us , but even though , <unk> , and yet , even <unk> , it 's going to be a <unk> to end up .
the <unk> has dramatically lower .
there 's no life in the way .
we 're just mobile .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents were <unk> at six kilometers to foot ran .
and we 're going to come up in a bit of a until two miles and these are the positive estimates .
there are studies that report on five -- to <unk> meters .
i 'm telling you a little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk> .
give me a degree of the chair ?
mike , are you , and you know ?
mike is americans .
he 's shy , he 's not talking about a lot .
and he was in this trial and sitting here now .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he 's got a <unk> in the hand .
and mike 's <unk> , less and less and less and less and takes more and it 's still <unk> , and still it 's always more and more .
why ?
because mike 's <unk> just sitting .
and i watched a little bit like <unk> mike , and i 've got a <unk> in the pocket in the pocket and i did again .
and there 's a thousand steps .
this was so the distance , the mike talks has been in the morning to the car in the office with the car in the office , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , back to a little bit of coffee .
and he came up to a thousand steps .
this is mike , mike was on this day , and it 's 10 minutes to his feet .
<unk> hours and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
under these conditions , disease comes from alone .
and mike is not going to be incredibly <unk> , because it 's too much food because so long as long , it 's not as long , but not as long energy , but not as long , but not as long as it 's not more than it 's more <unk> and energy .
and first of the power , the energy , like you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , there 's not there .
the <unk> of the <unk> are back in <unk> blood .
and also , it 's active and <unk> and quiet on his <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so when the energy <unk> into blood , the doctors are <unk> <unk> and high <unk> .
and this <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> holes in these <unk> .
and a happiness is still in the whole fat , and the <unk> are now going to be in these little wounds and we 're talking about <unk> or <unk> .
and now , <unk> heart is right now , because now he has to get the blood through these tight <unk> <unk> , and we talk about blood pressure .
and when this hypertension is , then , it 's also a matter of <unk> .
and if that happens in the heart , we call the heart attack .
and when that 's happening in the head , we call it a stroke .
and in germany , the second person dying of heart attacks and stroke .
that means , in germany , every second is in <unk> .
and <unk> is not going to be sick of it , so it 's not getting sick because he does n't get a sports , but not it 's gone .
and if you do n't know these things , then you 're going to look at the wrong spot .
for example , for instance , diet .
i 've got a little bit of dieting , the diet of amazon and there 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there 's the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and if each book is just like a centimeter , and we would be <unk> , we would have a 30 yards of <unk> <unk> .
and i read the read for you all .
and there 's actually , so that 's really important when you 're going to consume more energy than you use , then they 're going to use them , they 're going to grow up .
and if you get less energy than you use it , they 're going to be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why do we need to do this ? '' we need books ?
you just just give you a conclusion .
the need is , of course , is there is a lot of aid , and it 's not help .
because why is a diet to a diet of a diet ?
because it 's a diet , and no lifestyle .
what are the things that you do , which is three weeks and there 's five weeks , when we go to this struggle , to the regular day , to our regular lifestyle .
what else is , you would have five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except for <unk> and again , a commitment to self-confidence , that we did n't have the <unk> and we did n't have a <unk> .
so you can get to be able to go through every new diet , in each new <unk> , and you want to integrate the lives in your lifestyle .
yeah , or no ?
and then , when you go .
and if no , they 're just going to remain it .
because when you get nothing more than the end of time , it 's pure local .
it 's the habits that are controlling whether we 're getting sick or healthy .
it 's the bad habits that are getting sick .
and it 's the good habits that are healthy .
and when mike in the mirror , it looks at the animal , there 's the result of his daily lifestyle .
when mike looks in the mirror , it looks there his everyday habits .
and when mike is in the mirror , and it 's too honest , and then he looks like it 's going to go .
because when he 's more bad habits than good , he 's in the direction of the disease .
and when mike is going to be the direction , the way of your goals is to be the goals , then he does n't have to change his life .
and then he 's just going to be good habits than bad .
and a <unk> habits is <unk> , a great example of that person is a weird animal .
mike has done it to be done , and it 's completely <unk> by his own day by his day-to-day life by his life , by the car , with the car , and it 's using each store ,
and at night , he sits down on the couch , and somehow , to get a movement over the movement .
so he sits in his <unk> path , and it 's going to be <unk> with <unk> , which is a <unk> , and then it 's going to be like this , and then it 's like this , it 's like this , it 's like this , it 's a little <unk> , so it 's kind of to come to movement .
and my grandpa have had exactly like this <unk> .
and it was a farmer and that did n't understand that .
they said , sports is not for people who do n't move .
and somehow he 's right .
why do we have to keep up the <unk> home , which we 've lost in the ground in the everyday life ?
we 've got to have a lot of <unk> in this <unk> , two hours of <unk> .
and then , it 's much easier to find the movement over the way where we 've lost it .
in the day , in the day-to-day life .
and so i 'm going to be <unk> to a point of a transformation .
maybe they may have the situation , you know , you 're looking at the situation , and you 're still going to go back at the first place , you do n't have a place .
and you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , what is called <unk> of this <unk> in us .
we 're going to want to go to the shortest because of the <unk> .
we 're planning our homes so that we have the <unk> paths .
we 're designing our whole life that we have the <unk> ways , but it 's not going to be there , but we do n't get there , where we 're doing .
it 's a very different direction .
so you can get allowed to get the <unk> and actually find the movement over and then find out where they came up .
so , i 'm going to drive to the track of the intersection .
and i 'm the only one that 's always high , and down , and down , and go down and go down and go down and go down and all the other ones .
but when i 've got there , i 'm a time i 'm going to me for me .
and then i <unk> the movement , which is just a way to be like that .
and when you get the <unk> , 30 minutes , you know , i 'm <unk> .
<unk> steps .
these are about three times <unk> .
and a <unk> steps , if you go back every day , then you know , that you would say , you know , that you would have 12 grams of fat in your body .
and perhaps , perhaps quite a little bit like a little bit .
but as a <unk> , as a habit , a few of the day , the time we have a lot of days in the year , we talk about four , five seems to <unk> five pounds .
we do n't have in our bodies .
and you give me more , i 'm going to give up it , and i 'm going to <unk> it .
the americans are crazy , you know , this is what you do .
this is a <unk> <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are the same thing i 've got four pounds .
just you see what happens to this little bit .
and when the effect is from this perspective , what 's what you 're going to begin to see what happens when they 're really going to be in a active life .
and these <unk> are going to get the day in your day-to-day floor .
once you have <unk> steps per day , they 're going to go to all of them .
and then you know , and when you feel , you have the <unk> on the top .
and then you 're going to have a <unk> in the <unk> .
they 're still going faster and stronger .
but they do n't do their health care of sports .
so they do n't have to make your health care of their way and from her time .
because the most important most important thing that do you do every day as a lifestyle .
and i 'm betting a active lifestyle to be able to be a living wage .
and i 'm now now to me now , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a very <unk> decision to be a very clear decision for me and for me .
because i think it 's not going to do it with what we do , or do n't .
it 's what 's health is to do what we want to do .
and so i 'm just going to talk about it , i 'm just one idea for you .
you just get just at the best .
and you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's going to go .
step for step .
thank you very much .
<unk> , how did it actually have the leonardo da vinci , <unk> way , and in the way the world is going to see the world with other eyes ?
and even in the way that we have to do that in the context , which is just a little bit , <unk> , is n't a little bit ?
could we have this ?
now , maybe that might have something like a box of doing a box ?
and how can we express power and confidence for our future ?
let 's start with the question , what do we actually understand innovation ?
and sure .
technology 's innovations , even the official <unk> of the government , the royal government , the administration of the federal government .
so , you know , do n't understand me .
that 's all great .
and we can be in the right now , and grateful that we have <unk> in such a fields that we have to be in the world that it 's going to be good .
that we have a very unique , unique wealth .
but how about the future ?
what are challenges to be a society when a society ?
and who cares because there 's a great map of the big , social challenges ?
so , it seems to be a way to be the end .
a kind of content .
so the economy are the world of the future challenges because the entrepreneurs then we have productivity to go to productivity and efficiency .
and the world are better going to make better in order to access to the world , and together and together and <unk> and then have to <unk> and then have to <unk> , so , what do you have to remove the damages of the world of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy .
at least , at least , we repair .
but who is that we have to look at all the whole thing as diverse ?
how if we have our <unk> to work for serious social and cultural dimension ?
when technology are also a cultural cultural innovations ?
now , if economic innovations also are also social innovations ?
if there were some <unk> thinking and acting to <unk> the solution to big environmental and social challenges ?
when it 's all the other people in the world , and when it could be done a whole different , fair <unk> development ?
because , how was that ?
both sides were going to be what companies would have ?
can we have a little bit of ?
you may be asking for you .
so far , we have this incredibly <unk> .
happiness is encouraging examples .
neurological yunus has a <unk> with his <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> in bangladesh , to <unk> poverty .
and interestingly , also , in the direct <unk> , what the state <unk> are done .
and he 's got <unk> as entrepreneurs , perhaps the <unk> of the world 's the world 's the world .
the opportunity there is , i 'm going to be able to make a <unk> you know with someone else .
and we can imagine , i 'm going to introduce <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> of the <unk> guy .
so great , but he also got his ideal .
and yeah , yeah , very <unk> .
i 'd like to be totally totally totally totally .
and if you see , you think , really , really , a little bit , we need to worry about our future ,
and then , in the end , he would have started to work somewhere in this one of our <unk> <unk> .
and that 's what he 's doing is all right .
and that 's called it completely , and it 's also very successful .
and yet , there 's something like this .
so he asks , there 's no longer , there 's kind of a kind of thing in me ?
so , this the <unk> is going to say , he always says .
<unk> are in all the <unk> .
and that too , too .
and he also had this <unk> .
so the right there , the <unk> , which has been broken in the same .
so not that he 's much know it , but that 's what it 's called the <unk> .
and there in the middle of the t in the middle of the t , he did n't know the knew he did n't know .
so , the more , it was surprised to be surprised as a <unk> , then it was to be presented with him .
as mister mister <unk> .
and as a <unk> entrepreneur , he had an entrepreneur who had been introduced .
so the it 's great pleasure , so with young people , the his experience feeling .
and the two have found that two and different ones have been playing .
and they 've met more than more than more .
how if we just do this in a particular talk about the two times ?
so , <unk> <unk> , so that 's exactly what was .
what is exactly the difference between the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
i did n't have that so much .
yeah , so , then , then , we 're going to begin with the question of the question , what is <unk> companies ?
so , you know , `` yeah , '' it 's .
broad markets , developed products , developed clients , huge <unk> structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also be quite visible to see the great thing , which is the great shape .
and once a <unk> , even when it 's very well , it 's pretty well .
what 's a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you 're not going to do it , it 's not sure that 's not that little <unk> of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it 's a completely different character .
because it 's not a little bit more precise .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
so , from the way , a temporary organization that 's going to be looking for the purpose to find a business model , which is the profitable model , of course , which is , but it 's <unk> , and then it 's scale .
and you 're sure that there 's a lot of the things that there 's a lot of developing , of different ways , very different ways , different ways .
yeah , that 's all of me .
but what are we looking at ?
so , i 'm going to get it to a wait for you to earn a lot of <unk> money , or you know ?
so i got there , there 's a little bit of all the way that fits quite well , so <unk> 's <unk> in berlin , you would recommend me ?
that 's called <unk> .
how you 've been successful in your business , and after the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
oh no .
real <unk> ?
what do you think you have their <unk> 30 money , what is your <unk> ?
so , you put a career as a <unk> or what ?
what happens to your engagement , how do i know ?
and also , we 're looking at the <unk> .
so the statistics ca n't give you a <unk> perspective , because you 've got a few years of all of all of all of all of all the <unk> , and there are a few years after that , for a few years after a much higher point of a lot of money in a lot of
money is always a successful company and a good <unk> company .
now , money is a energy source of <unk> .
and it 's the basis of the ground for economic management assistance .
but it 's never the target of a company .
yeah , what is the goal ?
the company is ?
so , if i get to go to the way , so i 've learned , without the goal is not the right .
and so , goals would have to be involved in and so far as well in time and so on .
and if i do that , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , how can i do something like i do n't know what i want to look like ?
so i do n't make a good sense .
so how to do i want to decide , because you do , and risks , and you do n't feel like that , and i think it 's so vague and <unk> .
yes , <unk> welcome to the <unk> .
but i have some of what you might .
a thread .
so , the way that is already <unk> , so almost secret .
successful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how do you say today ?
<unk> , i think , `` oh , '' <unk> ?
so we 're still going to say , `` we 're always going to say , `` do n't give up . ''
and if you have an investment , in the case , and <unk> and <unk> are viable uncertainty .
so , you know , do n't help us .
i think i can give you one of you .
okay .
yeah , thank you , mister !
but there 's just a question on it .
and that can be a moment to be one of the most important consumer qualities of the order of questions .
can we get the back to another one of the other , that maybe we get better ?
so the first is what is i here , and what do i do ?
yeah , <unk> , there 's <unk> what 's moving on you , bigger than you ?
what are you going to do on the world ?
what have people have to work in , when you work with you with you ?
what are you ready ?
what are your inner , maybe even though unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that it 's important ?
because that 's the <unk> <unk> .
and how did we learn this ?
and if you do n't want to build a ship , the men together parts are together to gather a hot piece of wood , but they teach them , desire to be , desire to run , <unk> the sea .
yes , good .
so i 'm going to say , i 'm going to ask me the next questions .
what is my favorite <unk> ?
what does that mean ?
yeah , you know , you 're now going to be your target .
so , in detail , i 'm <unk> in detail , but i 'm <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
do you know the story with the pink elephant ?
it 's got a little bit .
not ?
<unk> .
so , again , again .
let 's just do it a pink elephant .
okay ?
does it work ?
so no pink elephant .
did that get the idea ?
no pink elephant .
you see ?
so , it 's how we focus on what we do n't want to do .
what is the only way to be ?
there 's a <unk> ?
yeah , wait , you know , you know , you know , what you want to do .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
but wait for you , you know , `` well . ''
by the way , what you can do is , you know , `` well , you know , do you think of how you 're doing ?
i brought a story .
and if you 're going to do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this <unk> `` lord '' <unk> <unk> .
who ?
at the end of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> , and you know , to <unk> me to the time of the time , <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i 'm going to have my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> smith .
oh , what 's the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
it 's <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
and <unk> like this is ?
is you what struck ?
does something changed ?
okay .
okay , the flower is too .
okay .
so , then we look at the same time where the bear has ever .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this <unk> `` lord '' <unk> <unk> .
who ?
at the end of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> , and the time you 're going to leave your <unk> at the time , and the time of the time is living in the time of the time .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i 'm going to have my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> smith .
and <unk> , how do you get you with this ?
so i know , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i 've seen the first time .
i thought it could n't be it .
and yet , i was still a lot of shocked , i was going to go through my head , it 's actually that i actually have the whole time in the area ?
by my life .
and okay , i do n't understand it completely sense .
to be the immediate <unk> , we do n't have to stop the most of the perception of our perception and our <unk> .
but what 's going to be ?
what i was and what i was and what i was doing is i ?
and that 's why , you can see , you can see your perception of being a particular position somewhere , is a serious important <unk> quality .
well , yeah , thank you , we 're going to be the next question .
how could i get to my goal ?
so , i think i think i think , is a good thing .
and i 'm looking at that , and i 'm not going to know each other , and it 's not just going to continue .
yes , <unk> , there 's a great news message for you .
so that 's what you 're going to do is easier to do it as you 've been known to this .
because if you realize your destiny , your inner code , and if you put a <unk> , you know , i would give you a very <unk> target , i 'll give you there in the face of the face .
it 's almost automatically .
you 're not going to be different than that a brainstorming is going to be going to be going to be on you .
these are the famous <unk> you have you in the shower in the morning .
and i 'm rich asking , i 'm rich , i 'm rich , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
and you 've also have a big model .
the <unk> <unk> have been the terrific <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> , when the <unk> did n't know , in a <unk> , in florence .
for lunch , the famous big table .
and that 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politician , charity , <unk> engineers , architects , and he has a lot of intense <unk> .
but not in our sense of what 's what 's going to go , yes , who is going to be ?
who has right ?
but rather than all of these different <unk> things , they 've got so on no way of which have been done in the way of being done alone .
well , yeah , yeah , yeah , the next question is , what 's the concrete next step , i do ?
and there 's a successful entrepreneur in the reason , very simple entrepreneurs .
instead of planning and management and so on the next step , it 's just just on the next step .
because what do you do to do in terms of uncertainty ?
but the very determined , and with all the consequence .
and then , if it was n't it , you know , dan 's going to be more to other step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> was n't much other .
so that 's why it 's critical to your point .
you know , there 's the inside of safety .
and the rest of how did we have all of all of all of all ?
but even though we did n't know that , and no one has told ?
you know , you know , you know , `` you know , '' there 's a little <unk> .
so , this rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather rather <unk> , and so this <unk> , looks like this , and that 's <unk> rather than that <unk> , it 's fun that 's going to be happening in
and that 's also the same thing that 's kind of the <unk> of uncertainty that are getting empowered to be empowered .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
so that 's all great .
but i do n't know , in the company , i think , i think there 's a lot of bosses have to change anything that 's happening there .
and in fact , in germany , there 's always a common mood .
and i think , there 's the politicians to worry that that changes .
okay , my boy , come on .
so how do it go down to the water .
what do you think how many people can do you ?
ten ?
tens of tens of thousands ?
ten million ?
look at this .
who you see ?
right , that .
this is the you can change you really change .
or to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , to say , the change that you 're looking at in the world are looking at the world in the world .
do you think of nice words and big models , but how do we work ?
there 's a <unk> , we have a <unk> <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all sorts of crises or if you feel like you , or when you feel a <unk> , and you all have to do with you with you .
and if you ask you in some situations what you 're going to say , and you 're going to be wondering , and you know , in the way you 're looking at all , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
ask you , what you 're doing is to do you at <unk> you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and finally , you know , ask you , ask you what you actually actually have about this crisis or what 's bad is happening .
so i mean , if you have you going to be there , you know , is that it 's worth about it .
yes .
<unk> <unk> .
and do you think you really , i think that 's how to work on my <unk> way ?
yes .
and you know , you know , you know , are two things .
first , the first time you find out on the clarity of your inner body , then you go to your <unk> of what is going to .
because your perception is .
and the second dog is on your inner attitude to her in the inner self .
because you do , you know , you know how to you have the other people to behave .
the future is only going to change your own perception .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
yeah , i think you 've already .
thank you , so , i 'm going to do it .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what are you going to do from our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how do we do it in the way that 's now ?
is that a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
all right .
so , in fact , i see the <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> really is really .
a <unk> of the <unk> .
and no , new <unk> , <unk> .
but this is the <unk> .
the most recent <unk> in the great famous name is working on .
robert bosch <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , or they all say , `` all . ''
let 's just <unk> this mind .
and who may have stopped from our <unk> of our time of our time .
you see , i 'm a <unk> .
so maybe it would be <unk> that i 'm going to talk to kids and the future , because of course , kids are our future .
instead of the view i 'm getting much more interested in .
i have a great my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i was making the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for <unk> .
we 're <unk> <unk> , which is that you can either be able to get in the custody of any pair of <unk> or find out of your being able to get a piece of work , and then they can also consider it .
so why are i doing me to <unk> , so the ones that all failed have failed to have the great mistake ?
our program is not far as easy to understand how the programs are the kids .
and i 'd say , i would have thought that the <unk> of the last place in the universe is in the universe , in which i would work .
what do you think is the most important missing factor in the childhood , with people that we work ?
we 've found out there are positive models often the most important role models .
and if you think about why it 's a lot of <unk> and so many <unk> and so many <unk> are not going to get a reasonable work , and it 's not sure that he would be drugs in prison .
and if you think about a funny boy about what he wants to do from his life , he might not have a better idea , how to be a different life , because it does n't have better role models .
and he was <unk> his dad .
i 'm looking at it , i 'm going to introduce it .
martin is <unk> of our program .
his dad was an alcoholic , and i made the whole family to the hell .
when he was 12 , his mother had died and he and his little brother had to go into the home .
there was the <unk> of the great .
he was shy , and he was <unk> and so the perfect victim .
until his day , when it was a little brother , for a soccer game , this is that this is the ground on the ground .
there 's been <unk> in martin , he went to the enemy and he found it .
and by the end , he was respects to find it .
and so there was going .
violence is a part of the life on its life , right ?
how about the person i 'm just described , right ?
after childhood , a lot of youth , many unemployed are unemployed or have a lot of <unk> .
they do n't know much other than their illegal activity and their <unk> .
and then you 'll fall a day in jail , where you put it in prison , which is that the idea of the same thing is not a better role models .
what do you think these people are in common , if you 're in prison ?
i mean , mostly good .
and they 're going to be a better criminal criminal criminals in the <unk> .
they sell drugs to a higher level and plan in the fall where they could go to the custody of sleep .
and then that leads to <unk> in germany , from <unk> percent .
that 's called in germany , every <unk> criminals are <unk> in prison .
but there 's also people in prison who really want to change .
but also , these people have to carry on the forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and all over the world , where you get your first identity .
whether you 're looking for a workplace , whether you 're looking for a apartment , whether they want to build new private relationships , you 're going to be able to <unk> this <unk> , which is so difficult to society .
this is the problem we are .
how do we do this problem ?
what are the quality of , you think , many <unk> are doing ?
you 're going to be surprised .
it 's a lot of entrepreneurial skills .
who 's got a <unk> , which is definitely a idea of <unk> , from <unk> and <unk> .
the topic of <unk> , it 's a little bit of <unk> , otherwise he did n't have in jail .
these are the characteristics of something that we want to use is positive .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three <unk> .
we 're going to convey the basics of entrepreneurship and economies .
each of the participants are offering his own <unk> and everybody 's <unk> .
and then we 're going to get the people in the fall of the <unk> , where the <unk> of the personal relationships and also in a different <unk> .
what are the <unk> ?
it 's a big range of the <unk> to the agency .
we have a <unk> <unk> .
a very large range of bandwidth , and i 'm going to introduce you to you to introduce you to injury .
<unk> <unk> and his illusion of the <unk> money , have been a <unk> to trade .
he had a lot of fun to run business .
he 's got arrested for the first time , <unk> .
and this lady is not really impressed in a particular .
the opposite is in the opposite .
he says today , he has been prepared for his second in the day .
and then , it 's <unk> to the second time .
and then he took a therapy for a therapy , and then the <unk> .
and there was how he learned how to be a <unk> talent for something that 's been using something .
he was taken in september 13 13 , then october his agency .
the agency is going to be right now , and it can be alive .
he worked very good at the way .
he 's with me today .
who wants to do that , you want to talk to him .
even back to martin , from which i had told him to the start .
martin 's got to be a education , and i ended up a education , and he ended up in his spare time in the <unk> .
and there 's alcohol and drugs there are the agenda , his cycle started right .
he worked with parallel and as a <unk> .
he ran this life in the day .
and he says , today , that he did n't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
one day , he injured someone who 's hard to find it so hard to be convicted .
he took the <unk> part and the <unk> there is really transformed .
he learned how to be more power and more of the quality of bodies could be without being to <unk> the <unk> or without drugs .
and he was so excited about that <unk> so that he had to be able to cope with it .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
that was the idea .
so he 's working on two years , and in the way , we 've been working on , and we 're working on our students to the way to the freedom of freedom , because it 's really aware of the way that if you want to change the right tools , and when you get a lot more possible than you want to be a lot more .
the basis of these successes are in the way , by the way , are people like you .
people who come in prison , to get up the <unk> in the <unk> to us , to provide our participants in their <unk> , to <unk> their personal plans .
these are our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our teaching , these are students who are students who are students , <unk> <unk> .
and these are our mentors who are <unk> at the moment of the moment .
and also , these people also take a lot of our program .
one example .
we 're doing a little bit of a conversation called the exercise that is called <unk> .
we put in the middle of the space in the middle of the space , a great <unk> of our subjects on the world , and our people on the other side .
and i 'll ask , and i 'll ask , different questions .
and every time when someone in the room , he answered that question , he 's called the line .
and here 's what we 're all in common , whether we 're in the prison , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and one example of where the differences are , is the following question .
i grew up in a `` social social <unk> , or i had a family which was in custody .
there are a lot of our subjects at the front of the line , and they 're just very few of our people .
one question i like to make all the link to all the things that i like to do .
so , i 'm going to get you all up to all up .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see it .
it 's all .
and great .
thank you .
i 'm going to give you a question , and if you 're doing this question , you 're going to answer the question , you would be just stand .
this is kind of our line , which is we 're going to take .
i 've done illegal things in my life of illegal things , but i would n't be punished in my life .
if you 're the question , you 're going to answer you to answer you , you 're going to ask you .
and there 's no <unk> to be the risks .
and that 's also , perhaps , perhaps <unk> , you may have been <unk> .
and there 's no <unk> .
okay .
and it also also matters , maybe each trial has not been <unk> in the way .
all right .
most of them are sitting .
we have a few angels in the room .
this is wonderful , there 's me .
thank you , you can get rid of all the back .
and if we ask the question , if we 're looking at the events , we 're often getting a lot of the people in the games .
and many , you know , too , you might have a lot of happiness .
happiness with parents , happiness with the environment , in the environment , in the environment , with the friends , but also also also , for the friends , but also also , for the friends , but also also , for the friends , you also , perhaps , you might not have always caught up with a little bit of being a little bit of the <unk> or out of the <unk> or beyond it .
what are the results of our work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni are in the <unk> days after their <unk> ,
so this is the speed of fast .
<unk> percent have already done in each other .
one third of the donor workers in the last year was <unk> .
and our <unk> is in seven percent .
i 've already had the <unk> of seven percent of the <unk> in germany to <unk> percent percent .
i 'm a <unk> .
a <unk> cost into <unk> per year , <unk> dollars a year .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> of seven percent of a <unk> , usually percent of a <unk> .
when my father and i 've started designing the <unk> , we 've been a open very crazy for quite a very crazy .
i 've given my great <unk> in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i 've never done a <unk> work in my life .
we encourage our participants in us .
responsibility , what happens in your life is and all of them is going to take responsibility to what 's going to happen in your life .
not too hiding , nothing to <unk> .
because that creates a very new self , and it can also build it to the back .
and that 's why it 's really happy , and i 'm going to give you a pride of your subjects on your way .
so , i brought you a little video .
movie <unk> .
so i was convicted of the two years , and eight months of months , and so for dangerous .
i was convicted of <unk> against the <unk> , and 10 months .
i traded the <unk> .
so , i have judgment from two years , because of dangerous , dangerous .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , by my whole suite of my whole range , i was actually changed my complete life .
and what was important for me was that this is the <unk> , which is also done .
because i was , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , i was almost <unk> , yes .
i 've got back to goals .
i found this one of the idea , i watched it back .
and you 're all of a different conscious consciousness and self-confidence , in the fall .
so far more and more , more and more , it 's still a <unk> goals , and then you 're still going to go into something .
and the wrong people together and not anymore .
well , the problem is that there is no <unk> , if the things are done .
the biggest problem because it 's automatically <unk> , you get up with the old <unk> .
you do n't know anything else .
by this <unk> individual individual , whatever has been , all of the things are just my way to me , about other things that has been on the problems of the problems that has been just a very <unk> to me .
i 've been a little kid in my first woman in my first woman .
and for the age of six months , i 've got to go back with her together .
so that means we 've started a new relationship .
and because i 've also have a lot of the <unk> and many other things , '' and i changed .
i 've done a lot of the whole .
i 'm going to begin with my family in the secret .
so i work in my life today , i 'm telling you .
i just just put a <unk> <unk> .
you know , you have to recognize that , you know , there 's a lot of people who have actually have a lot of people who are actually , like , in fact , my mentor , and in fact , i do n't know , i do n't know , <unk> of the things that are <unk> from the way of
i 'm grateful to that you 've got to the idea that they do so .
i 'm grateful for you , and i 've got to have trouble with a certain case , and i 'm extremely grateful that i could be part of it .
and of course , of course , the whole people who were support , they were involved in the process .
i 've talked like a lot of people who were talking about the <unk> , and i always <unk> me , and that 's good , do it .
and that 's why i 'm going to do it .
and tell you , thank you .
come with us in prison .
each of you have something we can need .
whether you were to do our participants in their <unk> , whether they 're being an <unk> to us , whether it 's a local support of the financial support .
whether you want to carry our program in a new field , very <unk> .
let 's talk to me .
martin poetry and i are today .
and you 're looking at the conversation with you .
thank you .
<unk> <unk> , i was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal .
in a time i was <unk> at a time .
there 's what you do these things .
for <unk> for <unk> .
the <unk> go .
one trial in the <unk> .
there are a lot of opportunities in terms of how to deal with <unk> .
you know , you can handle <unk> .
anyway , i was <unk> <unk> .
and with my work , so little <unk> with the <unk> .
so i have to talk about <unk> .
and not from real problems .
my problem was , i was <unk> , and could n't be quite a precise act of color , and my life is going to look at 10 years , 30 years .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> , i found scary .
and to give up the <unk> .
in fact , i had an <unk> problem in the way .
professionally , how private .
i just did n't know , i did n't want to go on the <unk> way of walking ?
do you feel comfortable ?
or what if i throw my <unk> back to again ?
and look at what happens .
what you 're waiting for me .
that 's the idea .
i was a <unk> of a <unk> in this time .
like , as i said , `` well . ''
the <unk> was also <unk> in the absolute level of absolute life .
you <unk> the world for the world , and they 're in a very <unk> way of a very <unk> way .
but also , also , very <unk> countries .
and developing countries where there 's more likely to see more than a <unk> villages of <unk> villages , even though they do n't have anything happiness and joy .
and that 's exactly of these images , and it 's a <unk> living in a way .
and that was me for me for a while .
i was doing what i did .
it 's the surface .
and also , i found a little bit of writing of me to write about a country i actually do n't really know .
i wanted to change .
i wanted to know where countries was going to do .
to write a paper article .
and to finish my personal interest .
how do you know countries better ?
by the way , you live with people .
people live in them , in you .
not in the hotel .
by the challenges , with the challenges of people .
and by people , you work with people .
at least , the answer was that i could give me on this question .
and that 's what i wanted to do .
and i was also going to do something a little bit of a job .
i wanted to afford a contribution .
something good .
and this feeling has been <unk> in me , and it 's still more empowered .
i was in the developing countries , but nepal was just <unk> me just very little .
until <unk> , there 's a <unk> civil war in which there 's not only <unk> , but also many economic problems left behind .
one year , with a annual average of average of <unk> dollars , nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and it 's still going to continue to have a day of the world of the world .
one quarter of the population lives below poverty .
almost a fifth of the population are suffering from malnutrition .
forty percent of the adults ca n't read and write .
all these facts connected with many personal stories and <unk> , who i met in this journey in a time i had been ready in a time in a time and open to change .
in the same way i wanted to be a change in the self .
and in my return , i stood up to my process , my decision , my decision to work .
i quit my job .
and i was <unk> the aid .
and i 'm also going to <unk> a little bit of the answer to the answer i got on my job .
because she was just a <unk> .
it 's a serious idea of <unk> international 's international .
and not about a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> , the wait for <unk> , and to look at a funding of your school .
hello ?
is it ?
my job was really serious , and good .
at least , i thought that .
and these answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really <unk> .
and of course , one funny answer was written in a emotional answer .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead i took this but really fairly intense to make what good <unk> .
i used it as a motor to give my own business .
<unk> .
heart <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
a company basically that we 've been looking at what i 've been looking at .
and that 's the possibility of traveling a country differently .
the possibility of being really going to get to meet a country .
by the way i have a place in the people , and work .
and there 's not somewhere in the way , but in clips <unk> .
you can take a little bit of words in two words .
so , <unk> and <unk> .
so that means how much , how to gather a place where you can gather good <unk> .
you can do a good thing to do .
this sounds like this sounds little bit more <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social business business .
we use tourism that are also social development .
and you use a little bit of <unk> to sustainable development .
so , <unk> , volunteering and tourism .
because the people who travel with us in their teaching school .
they pay for their journey , like in another trial .
but they 're just traveling .
they live in <unk> .
and the idea is not a lot of recovery or more <unk> , but real <unk> , and i 'm not working with a lot of exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
and the people who are looking at the <unk> and interests in different projects .
we can have a <unk> <unk> in the world in the world 's <unk> , in the most basic quality of <unk> tourism .
because it 's really missing the infrastructure .
for other people , we can promote sustainable projects .
we can <unk> our sustainable projects and finance .
so we 're providing a hundred percent of ourselves .
they do n't rely on donations .
and that 's just for our long-term <unk> engagement .
we started with our work with <unk> in nepal .
we have the engagement in uganda <unk> .
and over four years , i turned out and have been married , and my husband and i are a <unk> question .
let 's go to the <unk> way ?
or what if we think about it ?
when we do n't think about the <unk> , and we 're going to get it ?
if we do n't have social engagement and sustainable travel , but development in its wholeness ?
and also the individual <unk> ?
or even more detailed , there 's a little bit of a certain different pollen .
that would be a new company .
a company , which is <unk> .
but with other things , the same philosophy like <unk> .
do we want to do that ?
was the next question .
<unk> new companies ?
we want to be that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're just <unk> .
because we talk the same language .
because we dream the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and so , this year , we have an sister given a sister .
<unk> .
and with <unk> , we promote creative companies in their development and <unk> <unk> , which we support in very exciting people .
and with some of the participants , we have the participants , entrepreneurs or collaborator of creative companies with individual development goals .
so the personal social and <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> .
and they 're going to prepare for the <unk> .
there are also <unk> in <unk> .
one of the aid of a meaningful <unk> increase in a meaningful lifestyle change .
he 's looking at a long time where you 're on where you 're <unk> .
where you might have a <unk> biases .
where you might have too little flexible , to think of the things .
and he 's showing a one thing that you 're right in right .
it 's going to be a <unk> .
it 's the creativity that all of the sudden , great .
or it 's the equanimity that you find new into the box .
the physical things that do n't make you make the environment you ca n't change .
and the power , things are changing , which you can change .
and you can change very much .
in very short , i 've got it .
we know that .
one example .
these are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
these are five wonderful women from uganda .
and by the <unk> and <unk> , with talent .
they put beautiful beautiful , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and we did n't have happened in years .
because they did n't have a market to be .
because they did n't know how they can improve quality .
because nobody said , which is the design of the question .
we wanted to help these women .
and so , i 've also started a <unk> program in this year .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products are going to get people out of poverty .
you give you a income .
one future is .
we went back to our <unk> live .
and we 're starting to start with a very advanced <unk> .
one <unk> <unk> of a thousand <unk> of our women .
it 's not just a year for selling a year .
but it 's also allowed to make the project more bigger .
the first <unk> is kind of social space and <unk> in a .
so who wants to support , can you make a tax with a piece of the other , but he can also travel to us directly to the project .
he can travel to the women and the <unk> .
we 're not going to have to be a little bit of long-term , we 're not going to give five women , or by a hundred .
and not just in uganda , but in nepal , and in other <unk> , in which we work <unk> .
but this <unk> is just a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we 're working in all central areas .
in the realm of <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work is in just a area too little .
what happens to the children when women work ?
right .
so we started in nepal and in uganda and in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda , in uganda ,
everything in our cycle are ringing .
and all of the power is more sense than each of each project .
so people we ever put in <unk> in the different projects .
and the exact idea of doing is that we 're going to have a lot of work in the common work .
and finally , i want to take you just a journey on a journey .
and i 'll give you the eyes to you .
wait for you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart , in the rural hearts .
you 're on a wooden wall of light .
and they 're happy and tired .
you 've got to have a <unk> meeting with your <unk> .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
there 's a pleasurable warm in it .
you 're <unk> out of the window .
and you see the <unk> children in the <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet , <unk> feet on the sand .
you 're going to be on your <unk> .
they 're also a thin layer of the <unk> .
the kids laughing .
and i call your <unk> .
you 're not just called you just a little word , `` you call you <unk> . ''
<unk> .
you do n't know how late it is .
but soon , you 'll get up .
and the <unk> , on the moment , the kids were going to go , <unk> .
at the end of the street , a big tree .
here you 're going to meet you with <unk> .
in the developmental <unk> , you get the new designs of their <unk> .
and how are you going to talk to hands and feet .
later , the other women are coming to .
they smile you , you smile .
until you talk to your english language .
under the tree .
free .
remarkably , there 's the internet there .
tomorrow 's <unk> , you have the coach .
you 're going to get you .
exchange is valuable .
and it 's also nice to talk about german .
you 're playing music .
and this <unk> of <unk> .
mama <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the courtyard , <unk> .
she sings a african song .
you 're a <unk> and happy .
you can do the eyes down .
each of us can make us the <unk> in a new context .
or at least a short time , the <unk> of the moment is new to it .
and then , what happens .
thank you .
before i start looking at , i would have interested in whether it 's a night that you 're here tonight , somebody 's house has been working on .
i mean , i 'm not going to <unk> the light right now , but maybe someone wants to be your hand .
here 's the bottom of the <unk> .
two .
so here 's the top <unk> , i 'm not not , but in every case , two , that 's nice , we 're all of the time .
and i 've also taken a building in the city , and the <unk> mountain in the city of the city .
that 's the building .
together , i 've got to have six people in the last summer age , for six months .
and so i 'm going to talk about this tonight .
well , now , some of you might say , `` well , ''
what is it ?
<unk> are a lot .
but i want to explain to it .
what , what 's the <unk> ?
and then you <unk> in the park , like ?
just one little selection of the questions that we have known , who have been trying to learn how to learn how i 've learned from a initiative i 've been to deal with a initiative to say , `` have a <unk> . ''
and all the time we had a seamlessly to <unk> <unk> .
and here 's the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , they were <unk> .
and to work on the privatization of this <unk> .
but who knows that , that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was not the elected <unk> of the initiative .
what we see here is a plaque from the <unk> , in <unk> .
this is a public space that 's private , and that 's why not for many people who are not available , but not in public hand , and therefore , not as not as a way that you can use public spaces .
we were a group of <unk> in the desire with <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell another <unk> .
we were a <unk> team , and i have to see it , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the parts of the fields , physical , physical , physical , political , and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography , photography , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and of course , with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspective and <unk> .
and we have allowed us to provide , but also , in different capabilities , but also , in different networks .
and creative , a creative part of solutions in the <unk> , which we did , is that we have done .
we actually have to <unk> the <unk> .
but it was that we were about the <unk> , and they 're going to occupy stories .
and we 've been asking memory and images .
and from these memories and images , they tried to develop possible perspectives for the <unk> .
and it was important to us that the process is always getting physical .
we have the initiative to be the <unk> of the <unk> , and as a <unk> .
so <unk> was a <unk> and emotional and a <unk> , and after a <unk> .
on the experiences we 've done , i 'm going to go back to the evening .
every city has grown places .
one of a face .
in many cases , these were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and get the cause of citizens , and in the other part of citizens , as foreign places .
they 're the dead places of a city because they 're just often the way that we expect to be in a public space .
so for example , for example , we have <unk> , <unk> .
now , these are the ones , but also the fact , the urban places , is often <unk> .
initiatives that want to be the <unk> to be living in the day , often often the hard interest in the infancy .
what has to do with me , and i like some questions , i like some questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places are not just a face .
no .
they 're the social places of our city , in the <unk> lives .
so we 're using these very first <unk> ties in our neighbors , when we would get to the way to the bubble .
and can these <unk> interior , if we have a serious way to sit , and actually , in fact , in fact , when the spaces are also designed to the spaces .
and we 're still getting more interested in more than being more than being .
and that 's how a different perspective , sometimes .
but what is a feeling of community is a feeling of community .
the more part of the more , i 've got the way in such a public space , and the more the more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and the more part is also the community .
and if i 'm not <unk> , then you see what you 're going to call the goliath of a big city .
we were two challenges in front of the way .
we can get the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood or <unk> in the <unk> .
how can the protest be transformed into creation ?
how can anyone be transformed in ideas ?
protest against the privatization and <unk> these <unk> places , and the <unk> of the <unk> and in fact , not quite valid and actually not quite common to the same places .
now imagine you are here you 're sitting here , once you beat the newspaper , and read the next text .
love <unk> and citizens , we invite you to give you a three potential varieties of the <unk> , which is called the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
you can not choose to skip the idea of the idea .
and the flavor of the most <unk> and then it 's <unk> .
would you go ?
would anyone who go to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it 's just great .
there 's a way of doing is a little bit of what 's <unk> .
you can get to <unk> , how this looks like in the future .
and as i said , it sounds great for the first moment .
i 'm going to try to give me a explanation .
and that 's because i 'm not allowed to be involved in the way , or choose or accountability or accountability .
first , because traditional <unk> often <unk> <unk> .
now , that 's mostly , they do n't have a opportunity to have a opportunity , really , to make a little bit of ideas , or a very sophisticated alternative , but there 's actually a design of design , and they 're going to decide whether they 're still <unk> or <unk> in the urban green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green green
or , like a friend of a friend said , which is color the trash of the trash .
second explanation , <unk> <unk> <unk> is rarely over information and voting .
think about three <unk> varieties .
so we have what we want to show you , and then you can not want to do it .
frustration and <unk> are often the consequences of what i find out of it .
i do n't want to make a decision of <unk> or <unk> , if i actually had a <unk> way of <unk> <unk> .
but it 's also different .
although the <unk> of the <unk> , many people have been experiencing a lot of <unk> , we 've got to have a lot of <unk> .
and so that 's what we took out of experiences and i want to share with another <unk> .
i want to get it to other <unk> , other projects , but of all the city city and policy .
because the ones that are the ones who are actually doing that , which are actually going to be done in and actually actually be responsible for these processes .
and when it 's really interested in a participation , how many of the things are often <unk> and <unk> , we need to have new <unk> .
but not least i 'm not looking at all of them , but i 'm also telling you all of you , which are you sitting here .
and that 's why i think , is , is a very important thing .
i 'm going to say it 's important that you all go to all , and i want to encourage you with our example , to give you a chance to give a chance .
and i connect them all because they 're the ones who can be the one new <unk> of the guerrilla .
so we need to look at the ability to look at the betterment , and we have to get the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for food and <unk> ?
first of the <unk> , for the dialogue , you 're going to give up a <unk> .
in <unk> , engineers are meeting in <unk> , citizens to <unk> and different interests .
what we see here is a certain kind of a dictionary , to invited us .
what we see here is some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal has to be that all of these conversations are on <unk> , so that not the <unk> capabilities or the <unk> capabilities , the <unk> capabilities are about the skills of the citizens .
the citizens in place , are experts in the world , they 're experts for their neighborhood they know , which is what you ca n't mix with you , which is a place , and also , what you 're missing in the place , what you do is , what you do .
the <unk> , especially in the city , what 's going to be in <unk> level in the project .
in the ignored or in a particular case , another thing , you can get to a lot of things that are <unk> , which is the project that are measured , after .
and that 's all the things that makes a <unk> , where all the information is accessible and then the place can be a healthy place .
by the way , by the way , you can get the footprints that can provide a swamp of the place .
a <unk> in <unk> means also means that the wish of the <unk> are actually <unk> .
and then , when someone says , i want to say , `` i want to make a <unk> . ''
of course , this can be <unk> , but the target has to be in <unk> , with all right , which is the right solution , and maybe then in the <unk> , but maybe a little place .
as i said , that 's how to get out of the dialogue .
second point are different crochet clips .
our <unk> is colorful .
one feels really , of being aware of a great group of great group , and talk .
another one can write good , but then you do n't want to talk about the text .
another , maybe one of them might rather be a little bit or photographed .
or you 're going to build a ideas in <unk> <unk> .
what i want to say is to say , what is to say , is to be different <unk> to be able to be more spiritual users .
so , we have to be a chance of being able to get up , just watch what happens .
the background is a little bit of little exhibition .
we have the opportunity to give up <unk> .
we have the opportunity to paint .
we have the opportunity to write .
it 's not from age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the opportunity to connect our ideas with their hands , to play ideas .
also , the way to encourage you to participate in <unk> .
for example , this can happen for a <unk> , which can happen about <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> and transparent availability of results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results .
we have a whole process of parallel with facebook and <unk> independent , and in the same time , news <unk> <unk> .
our third point of <unk> .
and you might remember , i 'd say that <unk> often is too late .
in my <unk> event , there was three finished <unk> .
but the process is , but then it 's just happening when it 's happening , and the alternative in the end of the presence of himself is n't even know what to happen in a particular area .
when i 'm going to talk about the dialogue , and i 'm going to have a point of one , which is where scenarios of a area are coming in a area .
and by the way , by the way , also , by the way , is also to the <unk> itself .
and then , when not a start to be <unk> that the <unk> event has so much and so looking at the experiences of the previous experience .
what happens is , when citizens , their city is <unk> , and their city <unk> .
you 've already see a lot of projects .
i 've got a little bit of <unk> , which is the <unk> , is probably known for many of this .
in new york , a project started , and it 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> , there 's been <unk> dollars , they 've got to be able to make the funding possible to do or at least <unk> .
the time has been written in august , the political could n't do n't in the country to make the idea of doing it .
and the <unk> in new york , to say , to say , i do n't know , because he has become a most important <unk> of the city , or not a idea of policy .
the opposite , the <unk> of the <unk> , stood in the <unk> .
in <unk> , we 've got back in germany , the citizens have already been <unk> plans to get it again .
the city had said , `` it had n't need to be a need .
four weeks , the four weeks , which we have for <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> .
today , the city 's <unk> <unk> .
and while the side of d in the side of the instant is a wonderful , and the city the <unk> , the <unk> that started using it , and they supported in other <unk> .
in other , the <unk> experience of their own <unk> are on the street .
in rotterdam , a <unk> <unk> had been <unk> .
all right , you want to say , you want to say .
and then we 're just going to do this way .
but i think it 's wrong , the city of responsibility .
why ?
one because you have a look at all of it or have a look at it .
and while the investigation , it 's been <unk> and companies are <unk> or companies on a form of information , the city has to be the responsibility for projects that are also on the edge of the attention .
and for other , of course , as the city of the city , they have to go to the projects , other means other are .
a <unk> initiative can be just <unk> .
and our goal was a temporary initiative to have been a <unk> trip to school , about half a year , and the responsibility to the city was going to come back to the city .
the models of the <unk> state has bought the <unk> in january .
it 's still running more conservative .
so we have unfortunately , the problem is that we could n't be a responsibility .
but we know , now , if the city has been successful in the <unk> , when the negotiations of the negotiations are actually successful , that then a <unk> is going to be done .
but what 's happening is actually open , but it 's a open .
and to finish , i think that a lot of projects that have been a lot of projects that are being transformed by the meaning , complexity or your cost of the city , you have to have a chance to create a chance of being a chance to create a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a chance of being a
when you 're just in time and all of the citizens ,
in a city and citizens .
in the city , and all of you guys are sitting here tonight .
when we do our jobs , and in the same time , the makers and the <unk> of the makers and the <unk> of the physician are not to perceive the <unk> of the citizens , but as a <unk> .
that 's it .
yesterday , yesterday , we were here in <unk> , and they 've got to be done in the <unk> .
we talked about <unk> .
so this idea , a lot of second chance of have a job of being done if it did n't work in this life , just as a second chance .
and we found something exciting .
and we were relatively lucky that there are two things that we did n't want to see the time .
that 's the story of someone .
the second one was still was in the table , at the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you might remember , perhaps , <unk> <unk> .
i 'm so , it 's so , it 's now the <unk> years ago , but the words are going to go to me to <unk> hands .
my neck were <unk> together , and i just want to leave back to it .
and then i do n't know how to be , but in my exams , then the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , who was always sitting next to me .
no idea what 's been going to be .
you 're going to understand it , so my school , my school , i was n't happy , and after i had my last <unk> of me , never quite clear , never again .
and what i 'm going to say is i 'll say , if i look at the year , some of the nicest days i spent there , i spent in schools .
and there 's a lot of excitement , and there 's no responsibility .
how did it get to it ?
how could this happen ?
and i first started that , and that 's what happened is what i could n't have to do .
i got kids .
so my wife got the kids .
and then , then , it was also clear that you had to take a person who had to deal with this <unk> .
until one day , when she said , `` honey , it 's <unk> .
and you go to it .
yes , <unk> .
and i opened the door and then i was like to be in this <unk> and <unk> , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
and that 's what we looked like this before ,
and the <unk> , as a <unk> , and i was <unk> , and i 'm <unk> , you know , man 's life here .
and when i was saying , and she said , and they know , and you know , the teacher would not learn to learn for school , but it 's a little bit of my god , i 've got out of the sentence , i 've never been <unk> .
what is what we have from school , from this school , actually , really , really did n't have them done ?
so many of us have been taught at all right there .
where did you have a little bit more good at the life right now ?
and maybe some of the world is the dominant <unk> .
what 's the end of the rest of the end ?
or <unk> , these ability in a very short order within a lot of knowing how much of the things that 's really knowing how i could <unk> it in a button , so i 'm not bad for me ?
well , i needed to have a <unk> for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what does a <unk> point of one point of one point of something that 's going to be a good doctor ?
whether the <unk> is , and whether it 's the good response of these things ?
no way .
so , no way , it 's no way to live for the school , we learn .
so when we look back so , about <unk> years , the <unk> century , there 's the <unk> .
this is time in germany , which was actually launched in germany , then it was a completely <unk> .
and where the school system , how we have it , we have the roots .
and if we imagine the time , it was actually so , in fact , the people did n't have access to the knowledge of your time .
and there were these four or six years they were used to go to school and have been <unk> , then the only way of the people who had to know the knowledge and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and
today , a <unk> of a <unk> of its pocket in his pocket is in its pocket and the largest library of the time .
and in the middle of the <unk> century , that was the time of the <unk> .
that means there 's a lot of change in the world and all of all people have been needed to provide these new machines .
but also , the same time , also , people needed to wait that machines have been waiting and repair and repair .
and we needed people who could build these machines and have been working on .
you might recognize it .
the <unk> school system that we have today is in germany today , has its root in this time .
and there 's probably done there .
and also , because it was probably so , because i 've probably had learned to the school for the work for the assembly line , which is who was in the assembly line , who was alive .
let 's look at the future .
let 's go to the <unk> century , where it 's , and let 's look at the year .
the year , the year was there was the first <unk> in the first time .
i was done with my study and thought now , now , now , you 're now going to do you to get your hand , the first company .
yeah , after some of the internet , i got out of the internet , and then i <unk> , i 'm going to go out now .
and some of these companies are <unk> and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and more and large , and some of the companies are then in free , <unk> .
you see two times in life .
and we had more and some years , and then we had 30 employees .
so we had a beautiful growth and we had so much more interesting in the board , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if you have a sophisticated concrete idea , but what they did in school , we had no idea that it would ever been .
even when i was <unk> , what the internet did n't talk about .
and the kids that we 're sending in school today , which are going to be the job in 10 , six , six or 30 years ?
the only honest answer is we do n't know .
and what do you know what facts are going to need to have to be successful in this future jobs ?
and when you 're honest , the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're looking at the future , and we could give me down who give me the <unk> for the morning .
there 's <unk> <unk> , i read .
well , you see , you do n't know .
how do we get out of the school , what are we learn to live in the life ?
what are the things we need to make kids fit to life ?
and maybe it 's a look at what companies are looking for employees .
that 's the <unk> of school , yes ?
the alumni of schools and universities are coming into companies .
and when you look at a very serious classic <unk> , then there 's first thing , what the expertise .
so , you want to do , so the read , so the read , we 're looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we 're going to look at 10 years , and we 're going to go out of it , and we 're talking about 12 years abroad .
it 's not going to be done in the future .
but what 's now could be , but maybe the things could be , the things are always important , these are the so-called <unk> <unk> , and i 'm hoping that these <unk> <unk> will be the <unk> of the future of the future .
and the principle in three groups , the principle .
that 's one , companies wish to help , who are flexible , so is that one .
and then , almost all the companies want to think of employees with <unk> .
and then these companies are <unk> who are <unk> .
so we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
let 's start with the flexibility .
that 's relatively fast .
if we look at how economy is working , how fast , how fast , it changes .
<unk> , all the business models are going to be <unk> from the internet .
there 's a need to provide people who can handle this change .
there 's the <unk> who are creative .
there 's the <unk> who are <unk> .
this is pretty obvious what the factory in the factory of the <unk> of employees had a <unk> .
the second subject , the entrepreneurial subject are relatively clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's about people who are responsible for us .
first of all , and her own life .
but also , the big whole .
whether this is the company or also as a society we wish to do , and we 're going to give us the responsibility for the big whole .
and the third factor that <unk> , which is almost most of the most <unk> .
and if we remember the football , then there was there in the internet , and there was this beautiful adage .
argentina had <unk> <unk> <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't <unk> <unk> who won the <unk> .
and that could be just the only thing together .
and so somebody who is , this big innovator of our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was n't the <unk> who invented the iphone who did n't invented the <unk> , who did n't invented the itunes , which has invented nothing .
the team had a team that made this possible because they could just create the team what they could have done .
so , <unk> school , who could convey these three things in the age of this , but that 's a lot of school , in the way that we learn for it .
but there 's still a <unk> of the fourth point , and that 's almost more important .
and that 's learning themselves .
if the only thing we can tell about the future with security is that you 're not going to learn , and they 're the ability to learn new and to learn new things to experience the <unk> of the most of the most of the life that we 've been in the future life .
but this is a <unk> school , which is what these things is doing .
but where was i ?
i sat in this <unk> and the <unk> and the kids who know that that 's not just a little bit of a lot of event , to pay for you .
so this is how hard , the way we 've already said , `` well , '' but not from each other .
until the point of time , where the <unk> , all the whole , all the all .
i was there and what should i say , in the <unk> of my kids , the <unk> of my kids were , the funniest <unk> parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father when the stress was about <unk> and learning the entire family family .
and less fun is , when the child is sick , because in school , stress <unk> .
and finally , this <unk> did n't end up with this <unk> , and it was a <unk> of this school , and it was again as <unk> .
it was not a <unk> kid , it was like a <unk> , so on the last hour , and in fact , we were also the only parents who were invited to be invited to
and i 'm going to show you and i 'm telling you the details of the day , and i would say , we have to have our child to be there , which is n't .
but two years , but two years where we have , there is something that does n't work .
what do we do wrong ?
and we had the question , actually , is our child ,
and are we the only one that it 's like ?
now , i 've been talking about the last two years , since i 've spoken in the subject of the issues , i 've been talking about a lot of people , and i learned , i 've learned , you 're not alone .
there 's a lot of them who are very similar , and this was two years ago , and i sat down with <unk> , and we were just going to be a new company , where the journey is going to be , and we sat down to the bar , and we sat down in the bar and have us
and what i want to say , he 's almost the same story telling me with a of his kids who has been a same story , and we had the lucky thing that we could take our children from school , yes ?
in berlin , there 's a lot of <unk> in different schools and we could even consider schools in the world .
but can everyone do out there ?
somehow , it was little , just our children in safety , and these <unk> are so much like that .
and after all of the idea now , for school , we have been a very busy system , we thought we were , we have a first thing , we 've got the first thing that we have now .
just , how do we have to change something like a <unk> ?
the good news is we deceived us .
we are not alone .
but we 've found relatively very quickly from great people who wanted to do , which is , which is a <unk> school , which is all of the needs to be .
it 's not so much that the kids and their parents are under the suffering , which is happening out there .
when we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
when we look at the number of <unk> , the number of <unk> has changed over the last 10 years .
now , can all be all parents doing what do you make ?
that all the kids are locked up and even the teachers are broken ?
or can it be that we have a school system that just does n't fit more like this <unk> , which just does n't just be done .
and we found a lot of people who were similar and we 've found people who have no kids .
and they understood that they have to take responsibility to take responsibility for the future that they need to take responsibility to the future , by taking responsibility for the way we go to our children and the kids going to go to school in school .
and we have a <unk> second , there 's a lot of great <unk> , and there 's been <unk> schools , there 's a great <unk> and there 's almost seven school teachers who are really dedicated and really trying to be involved in .
and there 's even a or another <unk> , which is also going to go to the first step .
and how should we help in a <unk> ?
we did n't have a concept that we could do with help .
but we can do one thing , we can go in these schools and we can come in these schools , and we can do the school , so the parents , and students , the teachers , the teachers , and the students , and we can make a lot of work in two days .
so there are people who have been working together in the past , that worked at the past more so much more and learning to two days , what it means to work .
and there are the <unk> of the <unk> challenge you have to solve them together .
and after two , so , for example , the new <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , for a <unk> , for a <unk> , for a <unk> , for a <unk> , for <unk> high school as we 're going to be a range of school .
or the <unk> are concrete things for <unk> problems that they have in their school .
within two days , developed the next day , the next day , can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be true .
but what 's the most important is , what happens to these two days , and it makes it so beautiful to me , and then i 've got to be a high school who i 've been doing , and then , the way that 's a <unk> in the schools that are going to learn the three things .
when the three things are in common , which is what the flexibility in the process .
so , as a kid , and when you experience a team .
then this is a piece that 's called <unk> .
and when we started four weeks to this <unk> workshop , and then we experience that school has been a whole started to change that there 's a whole new culture .
and this is incredibly <unk> .
and i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to think you to think about school .
i 'm going to say , `` i invite you to think about school .
and i 'm <unk> in all , too , to say , about school , talking about school .
talk about what you do , but you do n't like you what you do .
you 're going to be surprised how much more <unk> you get and how many people have experienced the same thing , but they do n't do it .
let 's give us every single school in germany in the <unk> century .
let 's change the entire education system .
and let 's do that together with the people who are the school of school , the parents , the teachers and students .
because , just , we can do this .
thank you .
