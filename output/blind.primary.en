yes , good ladies , my gentlemen .
so thank you to talk to the invitation to talk to this .
and i 've got to imagine myself .
my name is christian <unk> , and i 'm a <unk> word , <unk> in the city .
these are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : first of the personal , second organization , third order .
so i 'm responsible for the city of this city .
and you do n't do the popular .
i know .
and beyond , and that 's something which is a particular son , i 'm also <unk> .
that 's what i call is the boss 's hero department .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and i 've been thinking about this , of course , is a subject to what i want to talk to you today .
and that 's the subject of the <unk> , because of the <unk> .
we hope to be the best and in the best part of the best , which is called the jack of what i said .
you know it .
he was at general <unk> .
and then i 'm just going to begin to say something so hard .
i 'll give you one .
so , if we talk to a risk of a disaster , for example , <unk> <unk> , rush hour .
many people are the road .
it 's <unk> .
and somewhere in the edge , a suitcase , lonely , <unk> , maybe <unk> with you .
nobody seems to be part .
the suitcase .
suddenly a <unk> .
leave the <unk> .
the police comes , <unk> , <unk> .
people are calling .
<unk> <unk> .
go out .
what 's going on ?
we do n't know , or we ca n't tell it .
people leave the building .
kids cry .
and some of them might even fall because it has to go quickly .
suddenly a piece of communication .
there 's <unk> inside .
it 's panic .
i hear here .
the rest i 'm going to leave your imagination .
but it 's no imagination i 've got to <unk> . <unk> ?
this is what happened in this week in <unk> .
there 's a pair of suitcase .
afterwards , it turns out that only in <unk> , nine pounds of drugs were in .
but people were just like that , and so one friend 's telling me from the building .
it was not told .
and there was just this particular piece of a sudden at least in the group who had my friend in my friend .
god is not <unk> , otherwise that would n't be as safe as white as it seems like it seems .
you see in a <unk> , in a <unk> disaster , there 's a great deal with communication .
communication is important to be important because the people in this situation is in this situation .
you want to know what is going on .
in the good , old time , the authorities was quite easy .
we just did n't say or not .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> .
you know , you know , to say , to say , you know , to say , `` you know , god , god , who are not going to panic in panic , because we do n't want to say the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a period of social media in a period of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time of <unk> and public tv .
simple and a funny thing because it 's not moral , and the second is that we 're going to be the last one , which is the case for the event .
you might remember the <unk> in the hudson river , which is a couple of year ago .
the first one was about twitter .
and from somebody who was a ferry and just <unk> immediately , this is a plane , and we save the people now .
this was not a <unk> .
you can see , we rely on it , we have a little bit , and i think , really , to be the truth of the truth , the truth of the truth , the truth of the truth , the truth of the truth , the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth , and very <unk> .
because of course , of course , of course , we 're also the last , which is the last , which is the truth of truth , because of course , we have to pay attention to , of course , of course , is that we 're only going to be careful information .
it 's public media or private media either do n't be so much because they do n't do it .
so , of course , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's a little bit of the media , we 've got to think about how we handle in the future .
and we 're going to get the good old <unk> .
but only as a form of <unk> .
that 's what we 're going to do about a hundred years of <unk> in the <unk> , which is , some of you , some of you know , when it comes to the <unk> .
it used to be done .
you might know what you 've had to know , which is a little bit short , for a moment , for a moment , and once a second .
i do n't know .
we 're going to have these countries with all the <unk> that we have to have this place , so , over facebook , above twitter , above twitter , over the radio <unk> , and the local media and the local media and the local media , of course , with <unk> , and in the end of the world , of course , eventually to get the information on .
and we know , we have to be very fast , and we need to be a lot of very quickly and we need to be very quickly and <unk> and <unk> and citizens will be happy .
and we do n't even think of what we want to say .
communication in the crisis or in the disaster in the crisis is a question of <unk> about all the media that are available to us , and it 's also a question of the credibility .
its credibility is our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens are either saying , `` citizens '' are not going to <unk> , and you do n't say it 's wrong , or you say , it 's all worse than it is .
so we 've made good experiences with facebook and twitter , recently , recently .
and they may have taken some of them in the media .
we 've had a bigger <unk> in food .
and that 's an called chemical bomb .
these are bombs who are <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , because the first <unk> in the world 's <unk> , but by the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in the ground in world war , which is that a little bit of the <unk> , which is led to two <unk> , which is the <unk> of each other <unk> .
the problem is only , many of these suitcase did never work and they 're in the <unk> of food in food .
and there were a older gentleman , who were going to be a little bit about how he said , `` it was going to be able to be able to be able to see how she had <unk> <unk> , and now ,
by the way , several times has been <unk> in all the <unk> .
we 're going to see what we find .
these suitcase were immediately in place , not <unk> , but <unk> .
and so , so we have just <unk> in the <unk> park , and it 's like a , in all the sense of the word , a bomb <unk> .
and in the story in the story of the city , the entire communication in the city of the new york , over facebook and twitter , with the consequence of the consequences that the entire <unk> has been followed by <unk> .
and the media was excited . laughter in the background .
we did n't even had to have the phone with the phone , but they have <unk> and <unk> , everything about <unk> and twitter .
and the whole great effect had a great effect for us , because the overhead is going to be <unk> across these social media .
and so simple , you have to give me a sign when i want to stop .
i ca n't look at the watch .
this is the legacy of that , because first of these social media has to have a advantage that they 're safe .
not so very <unk> , because the members of the <unk> or the <unk> , how to call them , a high school .
secondly , early <unk> .
if anything is not true , you know , someone 's going to be , and someone immediately , the overhead , which i 'm just talking about , because the entire community is involved in the <unk> .
and it 's a very high <unk> of <unk> , so if anything is wrong , it can be very quickly .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said , `` well , the exciting thing that became exciting to the <unk> park .
so from all of these things , we have happened in the last few years , and there 's a lot more <unk> than <unk> , as a <unk> of one .
the city can eat every day from such a disaster .
one bomb that has to be done in <unk> in a park , is certainly not these .
but you can also find out , and then we 're just going to find out of the <unk> , and then we 're standing on our <unk> and try to get back in seven feet .
and if you think , you think of <unk> , you think of other cities , if you 've got out of it , because they 've got to <unk> , because you ca n't expect a <unk> , then we 've never know a lot of homes after that before .
and that 's important to communicate , one of the one thing is , because it 's going to be <unk> in a world of <unk> speed , to do communication , to do communication to make sure that people are going to worry about that people are going to worry about this difficult situation .
and the social media also help us , because eventually they 're all in communication , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and certainly in the <unk> of the <unk> .
so of course , today 's not just a task of the authorities , not just a task of the power , not a task of <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is the <unk> , but communication in the disaster , but in the disaster .
and <unk> has shown this .
there 's a lot of twitter and over facebook , when you were a lot of aid , when you were just too <unk> , because all of people were able to build a lot more sophisticated , and you did n't know where the <unk> are .
now , this is a lot to do , and also for public communications in the <unk> , but there 's the unprecedented part of the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> in the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> media , from a <unk> , from a communication of communication .
and i hope i 've been able to believe that i 've been a little bit convinced you that the medium is being used to be used for the beautiful things of life , and the purpose of the world is that as a city that 's also going to be a new instrument in the future , to the citizens of the <unk> and citizens , and
thank you .
this beautiful night .
i 'm a little bit different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you 've heard .
and i 'm just going to give you a little bit of a <unk> .
what it 's is that i 'm going to make there are <unk> there , and i 'm going to give you a moment .
before i do that , but i have to <unk> some things .
the first is , i think , i think we need stories to live .
that we could n't live with stories .
and also , i think , i think that there 's a lot more <unk> , <unk> stories , more than the entertainment industry .
and i think i think that the internet , which is infinite , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , does n't be done properly <unk> .
and four , i am convinced that i 've convinced that people have been created to be creative .
and they 're happier , once you can be happy .
the more people are happy , the better , it 's the world .
it 's logical .
now , these better world is now a byproduct .
in first line , i am like i said , storyteller .
and the story that i want to tell you , it 's starting to be <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in the moment .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> birthday .
now it 's not going to be a lot of the <unk> and the singing in the moment where it 's going to be in midnight , something that 's happening in .
it happens in your head in your body , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really do a little bit .
you do n't know what 's going on .
now , i have words .
i call this the magician <unk> .
you see on a page and <unk> in <unk> and everything is quite black .
i 'm kind of quite <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we have the two and a lot of color in the country .
and in this point , i told you that i was better <unk> and write as i read .
so , the first thing now is now with her new perception , is a total man with <unk> hair , who says , she 's very serious , and says , `` congratulations .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that she belongs to a very special kind of people .
she was born as a <unk> .
the players are people who have to be <unk> at their <unk> to play their lives .
who are the ones who knows ?
very nice .
imagine the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> , if you get each other , but <unk> from the pocket .
so <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything possible .
what really matters is that the players have no glimpse on their <unk> .
we do n't know when we die .
i wish everyone 's long life , but we do n't know it .
it can also be all over everything .
and so , it 's what it is in my players .
they do n't know , in order to do how much they can play .
again , that means , every lost person could be the last .
a player who has an entire life index , <unk> in the moment of the <unk> , like a candle that will be <unk> .
now , of course , you can ask , if this is so dangerous , why do you play ?
the answer is quite clear : this is .
without play , without having a <unk> , <unk> , everything is gray , it 's actually alive .
they were born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how you 're looking at the world of the player , their first challenges , in love with love , that 's the story i want to tell .
and in a form of <unk> .
the first season has 12 consequences , i 'm sorry , i 'm going to be a <unk> that i 've only seen too late .
so 12 , 12 points in the first season with a length of five or seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence of the other , beautiful <unk> , you know .
television has nothing else for its <unk> .
that 's not new .
and when it would be , i 've got it all over .
and there 's also not there .
but it 's just right now .
let 's go back to <unk> .
what is the most famous sentence or from the series ?
it can be one , right .
thank you .
when we had practiced .
and that 's true of my player 's true .
it can be a lot of all .
there are many different games .
think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
and that 's what <unk> is also the number of players .
and so there are a lot of stories that are all being told .
now the next question is : who is that to tell you all ?
i have a fairly high opinion of me .
i think , i think , incredibly powerful and extraordinarily creative .
but i know that hundred brains are more than one , even if it 's mine .
so it came straight to the idea that you were dealing with in the creative process .
what if we 're not just talking to <unk> and allow us , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very much a very welcome to you , the development of this <unk> .
imagine , for example , for example , for example , in the conclusion , a <unk> appears to find a little bit of a <unk> , because it reminds them to their grandfather .
it 's also a huge fan of <unk> .
and then you can just do , with this technology , that 's not so difficult to make a <unk> .
and this is the store on the <unk> , where it 's right , and that 's the really cool <unk> , which is really painful .
that means it 's not somewhere , but it goes straight to the right there .
the really nice thing is that we are in the internet .
and in the internet , you can really do everything .
so , the medium is allowed to be allowed .
it 's called you as the audience you can write , draw what you want to do .
and now , when we look at this structure .
this looks like a little bit of <unk> web , right ?
that 's how this <unk> is built in common .
and i 'm really trying to believe that the internet was born to tell exactly these kinds of stories .
it 's not even so many , you do n't know .
now , now , i 'm going to go on , i 'm going to get a step further , and i 'll give you the viewers themselves .
and in a <unk> .
and there 's the characters for the <unk> , but also in humans in the real environment , which also these <unk> on your cell phone .
so <unk> , you know all of all very good , are like mobile <unk> and <unk> entertainment .
these wonderful areas that are going to develop very rapidly .
and i ca n't go down , because i would have six minutes later .
we 've got it together .
everyone 's time it 's from three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> , and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> , i could have a jury of the , moment , and i have to find the short statement , the <unk> innovation .
they gave me the first price for the best <unk> .
and i 've got to say , this <unk> was from <unk> of banks , from the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so , really honest people should be my .
and if i could convince the convince here , the internet is really using , to revolutionize <unk> structures , by the way of the world , i think i can really convince everyone .
so .
everybody 's time , why is that all right ?
because of this , in this name , all parts are covered .
and of course , of course , we have a first thing , of course , who is , who 's it , i 'm on it , you know , everyone 's time .
and then , of course , this is the dying .
and in the series , very much a lot of .
everyone 's time is : everyone has to die .
and then , of course , everybody 's : everyone 's time in the sense of each other can come on , if he wants to .
this is completely important .
i come from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse than when it 's going to be a <unk> .
i do n't know if you know that .
and if you are in the theater , and then the actors comes so in the auditorium and all that : oh , oh , god , please do n't me .
and this is not .
so it 's a interaction .
and no one must .
he can also be the same .
the reason i 'm talking about german is that the whole project is also in german , first .
that 's a few reasons .
and i 'm working with this project for the way , and i 've been asked again , and again , the whole thing is , do the whole thing to english , demographic , blah , blah , blah .
i just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then the spanish and then the german .
so it 's not so much as we would move into a little bit of light .
and also i really think i really do n't really think it 's really , if there 's other people like me , that people will be grateful for something that not been <unk> by any <unk> , where , in the end of the <unk> and every single letter .
so if this is all right now , how i 'd like to have it , the first of the first led to <unk> online .
and when you ask questions , why i 'm here now , there 's a <unk> , where it 's going to be <unk> in the <unk> .
and i 've done some thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just symbolism .
i 'm also quite sensitive to <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also and <unk> .
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredible <unk> .
but it does n't do anything if you do n't use it .
and my project is just <unk> things where i just took all of what i 've learned .
and it 's applied .
and there 's all right .
i 'm just just going to say .
so , when you think , if you think , i think , i think , i think , i think i 'd like to make a part of my part , i had a idea , or i 've got a idea , or i 've got a idea of <unk> , or whatever it 's now .
you find us in the internet .
facebook .
great , like the speaker .
yes , i am also .
welcome to : can you delete memories ?
question .
can you get memories ?
can you remember anything , what happened in your life ?
have you remember <unk> ?
who has who can remember anything ?
it does n't go home .
so , you can do these memories ?
it seems to be .
thank you .
no , so simple , we do n't want to do it .
now , the talk is quite short .
and good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
now , the talk today , my talk , i was chosen , because he was two of my passions or my two great passions .
and i 've got a lot of <unk> , and i 've got to me with bits and bytes , which is so big by the world .
and there 's a little bit of time , i 'm also a coach and <unk> in private and <unk> in the private sector .
so on the one side , i have a lot of work with the computer , on the other side of the other side , i am in the human <unk> of the human being <unk> in the human <unk> <unk> , so that 's the human being ?
so how can you change ?
the order to give you a comparison .
i was in a very interesting conversation about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when can we build a computer that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think there are quite close to it .
so i think about two , three hundred years , it does n't need this .
but let me leave you , why you might have a little bit more .
so the comparison between the computer on a page and our brains on the other side .
so if we take the computer , it 's all right , so your iphone , your tablet , your tablet , the tablet , and these cameras , and all these cameras , and all these smart refrigerators somewhere in <unk> little chip .
he 's called <unk> , central <unk> <unk> .
these parts are <unk> transistors .
the word `` the word has already heard , and in <unk> , it 's always as a triangle .
the <unk> little device that has three <unk> and light of electricity or not .
in our computer , we have a lot of <unk> , i 've got a extra <unk> of these little <unk> of these little parts .
and the nest maintenance workers get upset .
we 're storing , we 're storing things , we know , we had a level of albert einstein , yes , <unk> computer can be a lot of a lot , very quickly , but
it 's not .
it 's actually quite sweet .
let 's change it with our brains .
our brains has as a tiny unit , the neuron , and we have it , and we have it , i 've got a hundred billion , a hundred billion , so , hundred billion neurons in our gray mass , in our gray mass .
the great thing is , our neurons have not only three connections , but they have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
these are 10 to fourteen zeroes <unk> .
so , you see , there 's the complexity of the brain is to be a higher higher than what we 've done as computers .
if we want to compare the <unk> , maybe maybe maybe the <unk> or another one of the first supercomputer that had your own power boat , ha , <unk> , and with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and our <unk> <unk> , but the box is going to have about twenty watts .
and the equivalent of two great bananas , so you do n't need to do it , and you do n't and your calculators is going to be wonderful .
now , if we 're <unk> a lot of <unk> good part of there , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , why do n't we use , why do we do things ?
maybe one or another one of the people who looks like the internet , which is the person to use 10 percent of his brain , you 're buying this <unk> brain .
and <unk> , <unk> , a little bit .
ten percent , but our brains are in our evolution in the evolution of the mass , which was pretty much smaller , in the middle of the middle , everything else has grown up .
that 's probably not happening because we do n't use this .
so why does it seem to be the biggest part of it ?
maybe you know the term of <unk> ?
i mean , i mean , i 'm just like the iceberg , when you see the iceberg , in the ocean , it 's the top , there 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent of the top , that 's about what our <unk> , our <unk> understood is , but is a <unk> percent , a huge amount of <unk> .
we <unk> the statement of how we have <unk> and <unk> , we have <unk> <unk> .
and , in order to come back to this memory , maybe the one or other people who are , or another person with <unk> memory .
people who have been looking at a lot more detail than i do n't see in the situation , and then the tell you , i said , `` well , where do you know ?
so this is , there 's a special , there 's a special , one of a <unk> , so someone who 's <unk> in a field , who 's been <unk> , who has been <unk> , in a plane , a <unk> , <unk> , so rome in a plane , so rome in a plane , so rome in the <unk> ,
and there 's not something like this , and there 's the river , and there 's no , no , every single house , every single door , every single door , he 's seen it once , he got to put them back to paper .
where does that come ?
so why ca n't that , why ca n't we do that , well , that 's the conjecture that the conjecture is just to access more access to his <unk> percent .
now we use it , but why ca n't i remember the <unk> night , in all details ?
<unk> <unk> made me about me .
so , for example , for example , for example , in the <unk> , and has been working with a rape war , who had its experience completely <unk> , which was n't the presence of mind , the <unk> <unk> of the brain , that 's gone .
wonderful , so that came very well .
but now it was about making people <unk> .
there 's a very safe conference in a very safe blog , where the end of the end or the event could n't remember , you could n't remember that , then they could see the <unk> of the cars , in which these people would be <unk> , which was n't going to come from
and in fact , with this diagram of the <unk> .
the second thing i found was , he had a lady in <unk> , who told her mother who was read in wonderland , who was read in wonderland as she was tiny , so four years .
she was sitting on the lap and her mother read .
and then he said , in <unk> , these <unk> , and <unk> .
and then she started reading , she was four than that happened , you could n't read it , you can read this .
and then they said , `` tell me the <unk> .
they actually found a specimen of alice in wonderland , where exactly the side of the text is that the lady was read .
so the brain is this page as she was <unk> , as an image .
and she could read .
so , we actually have access to that , but we seem to say there 's a way we have to have <unk> kind of <unk> to <unk> us .
now , now we do n't store the event , but how <unk> said , there 's a picture , which is a <unk> , which is what we realize , which is what we feel , and what we feel like , and what you feel , if you get a yellow <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's the <unk> idea , you know ,
and , it was a long evening , and it was a long evening , they 're going to be <unk> comfortable , ha , <unk> , <unk> , and then i 'm going to ask you , and then i 'm going to ask you , and then you 'll just get a little bit , but
and remember a very <unk> , positive event in the youngest past , yes .
take the first thing .
and , if you do this now , you might think that you get a visual part of this memory .
you might get a picture , maybe even a film ?
so , some of the things that does n't mean , because we do it so normal , but they do that to the first time .
and if you see that , you can see that they 're either in the film , from your eyes , your eyes are all in your eyes , or how they look at a canvas .
one of the call we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you very much to solve the thoughts .
who has a visual information , for hand , hand ?
yeah , there 's a few hands on a few hands , which is so , so that 's how to say , `` well , third of it , i would say , what i would expect , it 's actually something that we often do so much in the first moment .
well , <unk> .
and so what 's nice is about memory , if you 're memory , you do n't get these memory , you do n't get these memory to a memory , which is a positive event , which was so beautiful , and you know , you might be laughing , and , you know , that 's the memory of
and now , what is fascinating .
and in fact , it was , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , you know , yeah , yeah , there 's our brains to power between what we actually know , and what we just imagine , what we 're looking at .
also , you can try and try to introduce you when you sit down at home <unk> and imagine something in the future , which is not going to be able to get things like something , if you remember what was in the past .
and , you know , you know , these stories you 're telling you to talk about <unk> , from back .
and then , you know , hey , there 's what happens and that , and that was so nice , and the longer the stories tend to be a lot of the stories , there was a lot of <unk> , there was a lot of
so if we do that in the mood , so if we actually change our memories so how we do n't we do it , i ask you ?
<unk> , when i came here , my uncle showed a picture , from his hut in switzerland .
a very nice picture , it 's a very nice hut .
only , the picture is a little bit more beautiful than the hut , so it 's artistic freedom , there 's a little bit of <unk> , because it 's a gorgeous dog in the alps , that 's a picture of the alps , that 's
and why do n't we do this with our own thoughts , because of our own thoughts , our own memory , hey , what , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , if i do that , what i do that , which i think of there ,
they actually have artistic freedom in their own thoughts .
and you know , you know , you know , so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , so , you know , you know , so , you know , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know , so , you know ,
yeah , i did n't get bad , i was the whole <unk> .
the whole night , and this thought did n't go out there .
i think it 's not going to go to the idea .
and the son <unk> friend of mine was a little depressed when he came down , because his mother stayed in <unk> , and he was just missed .
what the father did , so he sat down with the son , and he said , `` well , what was the most beautiful , what happened ?
and what was the nicest , tell you , and then he has to tell him , and then he has to tell him , it 's what 's going to tell him exactly what 's great happened .
and within two weeks , it was really the son .
and then there was okay , which is the <unk> way to come back .
and the whole story is the whole youth about this , which is one of the most popular people i know .
so it 's not the memories that are shaping us in where we are , but it 's our focus on what thought we use .
and how much energy we use to use or use it .
so if you were <unk> <unk> thoughts , and say , this was <unk> , which is so much , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
so what <unk> is , ah , what nice , yeah , <unk> , <unk> , yeah , `` oh , '' that 's nice , man , who was beautiful ?
and then you take this .
take this with your <unk> and let me see it .
or if you <unk> somebody 's <unk> , it 's <unk> her boss , or your boss , or her wife , or her husband , you know , it 's <unk> .
so , do you take the picture here , you put a <unk> hat , hey , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the background , you laugh , why do you laugh ?
because they 're looking at , because these ideas are funny .
and you can get much better with the situation .
so can i mean , `` well , memory ?
no , i think our brains have so much capacity that it can store everything .
but it 's nothing because we can choose the answer how much we focus on , and how important we think of a thought , a thought of thought , it comes to us .
my plea to you you , you 're playing with you with the images in your head , use your power of your <unk> , and give it every day , the lives .
boy : good afternoon .
thank you for inviting .
if i 'm going to ask for a party , what i 'm doing so in my school , and i 'm telling you that i put together with friends , and you know , my friends , i see shining eyes , and in the minds of the audience , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> show .
now , when i <unk> , it 's a <unk> called <unk> music for classical music , which is that <unk> <unk> images of the old <unk> , images of old people who are sitting in <unk> rooms , and very focused on the arts .
frank <unk> said to talk about music is like architecture .
and so that 's the way that we do with what we do .
so you can get a glimpse of what i 'm talking about , i brought a short movie .
film .
there 's something that is impossible to be <unk> .
this brings it from my view of the point .
and since <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> are <unk> , something completely different .
we are now , of course , and in the middle of the <unk> , and the end of the middle , the end of the end , at the end of the end , and the end of the end , and the end of the end , the end of the end , and the end of the early days , and have been very early in our adolescence , which is an incredible force and <unk> music .
but we have also experienced that the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , there 's a little delight , you know , a little bit .
and we 're the permanent belief that the future music is not on the content of content , so on music itself , but of your <unk> .
so we ask the question , how can we create a <unk> , that the music is near , the friends and this force again , who are so much like that .
how can we organize a <unk> , which works beyond the <unk> of the <unk> ?
we imagine the parameters you know from the classical concert , space , time , space , essentially in the question .
let 's take the relationship between the audience and musicians .
you usually have a gulf between the stage .
we 're trying to be a <unk> .
here you see a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians sit in the audience , drink beer , entertain people in the <unk> with the world , are playing , are a , two pieces , stop in audience .
this is a little bit of <unk> in the evening .
everyone who looks like , come on the stage and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
the classic concert is that you 're on more or less comfortable , <unk> chairs , like you here , and watch out and listen .
but there 's music , there 's no way you ca n't be quiet .
and we 've done the idea how you can do this .
if you 're sitting different and you can put yourself into a <unk> piece of music , you 're automatically listening to different .
and that 's where we did n't have a stage , but four stages of the world .
the audience could have been <unk> .
so this was the night in the first row .
it 's important to us is that we do n't just make a little bit more sophisticated , but that 's the music of thinking .
so that 's what we ask us , what are the spaces and the <unk> way , but in the head of the people need the music that music can be done how they do ?
and then , in the course of the <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> , which is s in <unk> , in <unk> , in old <unk> .
but not just the spaces , and the illumination can get music and currently now , but also the connection with others .
and so we 're completely happy that we 've been working with a few years , with a few years , with the <unk> of the <unk> or in the movements of music , which is not to be written in the dance .
and then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , that 's how to be <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , by steve reich .
and in this year , we have a , yeah , if you want to get this one .
we have a concert in the first time with a <unk> system .
we have the story of the soldier from <unk> <unk> , dancers , <unk> , and just <unk> <unk> .
and so that 's also true of all , because we had a big <unk> , which led us in this piece .
we 've got a lot of money in a lot of money from people from the people from the <unk> , so that we could have been an effort .
at all , this <unk> is something called a community of community .
we 're completely happy to have a little bit near <unk> in the city of a home .
the city is , which is exactly the big , that we find great spaces and exciting places for <unk> , but also so small that we are .
if the start of the year in the spring of the year , <unk> of europe has been in the city in the city , then easy to the city more people in <unk> .
the whole <unk> is called <unk> .
we 're a colorful <unk> mixture of students and students , medical school , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally completely connected .
and to be a <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> or coordination , and funding in the eye , <unk> seven to 10 , <unk> makers in a year .
it 's also <unk> , but they 're spending a year for example , for example , the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> are in permanent hands and to the <unk> .
we all do this in our school and live in a very germany .
that 's called the largest part of work , and on a <unk> .
only three months , we 're distributed distributed to a <unk> weekend , <unk> , <unk> , and another problems , which came up with each other , and they also have the most important one that 's just relevant to something that is really important in movement .
and in <unk> , then we have six to 30 volunteers who have a few days , or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a few weeks or a
and of course , in these 14 days , the musicians come to .
now you might have my , you could have anything you need to have a <unk> .
but our <unk> still continues .
and we have a big community in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city in the city , in the city , in the city , in the city , in the city , in order to build us in what we want to do .
that 's the classic <unk> , which is also about very practical things like , for example , because we have an baker , which is a baker , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is going to provide fresh food .
the <unk> is done in a <unk> in the city over the entire year and sold .
until the <unk> .
we 've found a whole range of groups who have found ourselves to provide their living room to provide the musicians there .
and in this way , the <unk> is going to be a piece in this city and over the people in this city .
they 're in a very special way of doing this <unk> .
since the beginning of the year , we could have been <unk> support by the citizens to create a <unk> in the lives , which is now the whole project in a <unk> and a bloody <unk> .
we 're <unk> from the stage that classical music is , it 's not going to come in the right hands .
and so we 're incredibly happy about that in the whole , in the whole , young musicians in their own hand , and at home in the cities .
now , if you ca n't imagine the right now , how to look like this , classical music , you get over .
next year , we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy when they 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you might think you might have to know .
you 've heard about learning or the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn a lot more , which is also a lot of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
let 's experience the experience , a nice formula for the <unk> .
what i 've learned from art and culture , now , i can say , there 's a lot of natural , because there 's ar <unk> , i 'm in this field .
and so i 've been thinking that maybe it might be a little bit of saying that something called a different title of a different title , which is what my talk is <unk> .
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot of work .
you have a little laughing now .
you always get laughter , although most of the adage .
why is that ?
i think this has to do that in the word beautiful , what we ca n't really grasp .
art , we 're also saying that .
in work , we say that 's what it has .
sometimes .
people who like to work , which has me to me .
but in work , we think about the <unk> and in the art of the art of life , where we 're moving in our lives , our experiences , our own ideas .
and so i 've got my <unk> , which i want to talk to you , in about three hours , which have been all the headline , with a college , so it 's easy for them .
it starts with the <unk> , for childhood , for a little bit , on inspiration , for inspiration , for the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not going to tell all from my youth , no concern , i 'm going to explain to why i took this for my <unk> .
the interaction for the first part of my professional life and finally , five , was identification .
one of them will know these pieces of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you learn to learn that in the first two , three years , if you practice , and i 've been working on .
and so 10 , 11 , i played these little pieces , on the piano , not far from here , on the <unk> .
these pieces of a <unk> live .
there 's a melody , and the other voice is <unk> , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and i mean , ladies and gentlemen , is a little bit of the art of art , and if it 's only two voices , and if it 's together to think of the present , in bihar , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , things that are together ,
and i 've learned that , and i 've learned two melodies , sometimes three , and playing with the <unk> <unk> , in the same way , in the same way , to hear a kind of mess , which is
this was what i 've learned , under other ways .
another experience i 've never forget , and i had the concern that i could still do today .
i 've got a piano , and i 've got more people in the room , and in the middle of the <unk> , i came out .
i 've forgotten it .
i 've played .
so again , again , at the time , i did n't know .
the audience has more <unk> than i was , because i was in the rest of my place , my notes , put them down , and i started the third time .
and they do n't believe how to me have me behind me .
but that was a very difficult experience .
maybe that 's also one of the experiences i had one of the experiences i knew , you know , well , if i had a <unk> , i could n't be able to go to my <unk> , because you can cheat more .
yes , the next chapter of my adolescence , i was <unk> with inspiration and i want to tell you stories .
when i was so <unk> , i went to my <unk> and told him , `` i would like mr. <unk> , i 'd like to play a <unk> .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
there 's a lot of <unk> , and very much experience with women .
now imagine a <unk> young man , so , a sentence .
i did n't forget .
and of course , of course , i have spent more working with this .
in the way , i was in the way , and in a <unk> .
i 've spent working , and i remember a situation i 've never experienced that .
it was the <unk> of the chopin , and now i 've come to the part of work , i just ca n't get a place , and she was with the most beautiful place , and then you had to do the poor , and then they went together .
now , i ca n't play it now , it 's not a piano , and i could n't do it .
i 've got these in the shoes , 30 times more likely to play and suddenly came right .
and then i left her , and she was playing in a sense of embarrassing , and i just know that i got me in the ground and laughing .
i was except for me .
i had nothing to not drink anything , and the music has done this with me .
one experience where i 've learned , really , emotions , also very options .
and sometimes it 's right to work that you 're going to work in this kind of <unk> , in these condition , i call it .
where it 's going on .
we had this situation in the <unk> <unk> in a organization .
and then there 's almost anything like that , when we made the <unk> , the two months , we took two months , where you would ordinarily have one of a year .
now , these were my sighted with the piano , with artistic work .
and now i come to my student , <unk> .
i was first a musician , but just as a <unk> .
we played <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i gave <unk> , and i 've got so much next to my <unk> for the music for the music and the <unk> .
in the choir , in the choir , together , a <unk> singing , wonderful experiences that are very , very far .
and then one point , where i was a <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> and the <unk> , and i made this story , this story , because of this idea of art , from this combination of art , culture , i was in the <unk> event , but law
and that 's the art of culture , to make a <unk> .
so , for the arts , but they do n't be an artist , but it would not say , `` it 's not going to say , '' but if you do n't say , `` do n't you say , '' but it 's not going to say , `` do n't you say , '' and as a <unk> <unk> , but to continue .
i was there in theater , and i was <unk> , there was no <unk> in germany , just in vienna , in vienna , and in the middle , i 'm still <unk> , and from there , i 'm going to deal with this question for art to make art for art to build a good management of art , a good management ,
and that was the reason i did not stopped in my workforce , in the direction of this <unk> , and i grew up with <unk> years , i was then <unk> .
but one of the other <unk> , and this stage , i 've got a interaction with interaction .
i came to the german <unk> .
the german <unk> has his <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , although sometimes in my surprise , because i was born in <unk> , always , the <unk> oliver <unk> , i got to <unk> it .
but i have a <unk> root , because my grandparents were <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i experienced the <unk> .
this was something that was something that i did n't know what i did n't have so popular , and suddenly i got involved in a different form of culture , in a culture , a culture , living in this <unk> device .
as soon as the <unk> of us , the <unk> , all in a different situation , in very different states .
and i started <unk> with <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> , who was my friend and colleague , and i 've always made music to music music , and i was playing a different , and i was playing , for example , i could be <unk> , for example ,
we 've done the <unk> <unk> , so , of course , on the <unk> of the <unk> , months , months .
and this <unk> , which is really from the people .
it was my destiny , i 'd studied november november for my <unk> , and i did n't know that the wall fell .
i woke up at the next day , i had the examination , oh , the wall , yes .
and so i 'm going to think about it , for any questions , you know .
and down , i was <unk> for the cities in the <unk> .
and again , i 've experienced that interaction like interactions of each other cultures .
in fact , we 're talking about the same language that 's going to be beautiful and became wonderful , but a lot of it became great , <unk> .
unlike the <unk> , it did n't come from the people themselves , but it was a lot of the top of the top of the top , and i 've been looking at a great asset , there 's the german identity , where the german identity has come back , and then the german <unk>
since , germany is <unk> .
there 's also a lot more <unk> in the <unk> .
and that 's interaction , but i 've learned all things , and i had food in the city .
so we 've got a <unk> in the way that i had a <unk> , imagine that when i started here , <unk> , stood in culture and play .
i still have the same .
you know , for example , for <unk> , you did n't want to write <unk> and <unk> .
and i was the first director of the <unk> .
so i 'm not so much so much so much so much so much so good , so that was wonderful , that i had this <unk> , but they would be soon , and then she disappeared because i could be in education and make alliances to education and make alliances .
we have a lot for the urban <unk> , we 've only have this kind of <unk> between the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , which we 've got to experience of the <unk> and architecture , from the <unk> in the blue stones .
many , many interactions , we could create , and i could create , and i 've experienced , and we 've experienced what that means when different people could pursue together .
and you know , by the way , by the way , i 'm always more <unk> of the art of art , more of the culture , and more of the culture , which is the most important between people between people , and all of the cultures , are
interaction was also between the <unk> of the <unk> , and we got to <unk> , seven , seven <unk> , seven <unk> , the idea of january january , the <unk> could be in the <unk> of europe .
but this last chapter , this fifth chapter has been identification .
so this word has two meanings , to me , i <unk> me to something , so i mean , but i can use it as a verb , and say , i mean , i 'm going to know something .
and that 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i 'm going to <unk> you or the community .
and i 'm <unk> with something when i 'm going to talk to me and say that , i 'm telling me to identify me .
and that 's a very big action .
five point three million people are trying to move , <unk> cities , to identify in the double sense , and recognize that you are a community in europe .
when big , we 've called <unk> , but anyway , as a community of many people who are in a big <unk> lives , and yet in least a common language , and yet as a common language , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , in least a common language , and yet , this is our key nations , and that was our key to <unk> the identification of the people , and of course of
in the signs , the <unk> of the highway , many times .
a experience of the <unk> did n't have some people in the <unk> .
and there was <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , working , young girl , from <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> students from a <unk> school , <unk> <unk> , from <unk> men , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear ,
and it was a particular effect that young girl quoted from boys and young russians then came from young men from a <unk> german .
and there was one of these young men in the piano and playing this <unk> , which i loved that loved .
and you know , he quoted out of a letter , and she said , `` i am <unk> , he wrote him home , and he wrote him home , and i wrote him home , and i wrote him home , and i wrote a young german , and i could never play a <unk> , because my two fingers are just <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger with a <unk> , sat down to the piano , and tried to play the <unk> .
and it did n't made him .
it was such a <unk> scene that i was going to jump up , i said , `` what did we learn ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> , we have a lot of people together , but we 've learned that we 've learned that we 're going to be more years in a living room , and that culture is that we do n't have to go out of the minds , because we 've got different languages that we have to feel more .
and that was a wonderful experience , and you see it 's not just to learn something .
it 's all about learning to experience and <unk> .
and if we invent a lot of inventing and invention , if we 're going to give it out of art and culture , our own location , when we operate in our own identity , by the conversation with art and culture , we 've got
and i hope you 'll have a lot of <unk> and <unk> , from which they make this asset .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think we 're waiting for the first picture .
so i have to support the support of my memory , so a few slides .
but it 's not a scientific slides , but it 's in my inbox , and i 'm going to find a direction to find a direction , where i think that 's the next few years .
now , by the <unk> words , i finally know , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you very much for a lot of what ted is , and i think , in the area , we can make this talk very much .
and then i had heard that if you could consider the talk to english , but if you look at the talk , you see , you would n't understand what i wanted to say in english , and so i did n't know what i should say , and so i left the talk to german .
how we 're going to die .
i have to tell you all of the <unk> .
<unk> was in the hospital i had the <unk> <unk> , and she was <unk> .
she was over <unk> years old , and she was like to be dancing , because she was too aware of the man who was in the first man who was in war .
and so you 've gone to the first year to the first may , and then long , a <unk> <unk> , and then it 's <unk> and then , and then on the right side , you see the leg cracked , the <unk> .
a few years before , she was also <unk> and had the same way , with equal causes , the left leg .
and then i was also a doctor in the doctor , and when she was a doctor in intensive care , how she was used to be grown in the intensive care of the intensive care of the intensive care , as she was treated with antibiotics , and has been able to see the conversation in the world , and the conversation was going to say , is that it was going to make sense ?
does it make sense of a way to make a <unk> of intense technology ?
so , in order , to <unk> , in intensive weeks , is that a person at all ?
and she was born .
five years later , i get in the clinic , and i see the names , and i can remember , and i 'm going to remember , because it 's just a little bit of the time , and the dance would broke the other leg .
so the question is , the question is , what 's what i actually do , if i 'm going to talk about how to talk about how a person is to decide how to choose what he 's going to say , `` what he 's going to say , '' or what he 's going to <unk> ?
and this is a little bit about the <unk> .
you see the <unk> of the called <unk> .
it 's a book from <unk> , like we 're going to work , a report on the <unk> .
and then it was so that the globalization was very strong , so that you have to ask yourself , how can it go to work to work ?
and you then , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
it 's going to be the work of work , it 's going to be a lot more likely to china , for example , this was a big subject .
and that 's also , basically the work of the individual , so something that has been <unk> , something that has become more <unk> that he has always controlled by the quality of quality , which is <unk> from the quality of accuracy .
and that after that assessment , people still have less self-confidence , and more part of a little bit of a little bit of a little <unk> , where it was to achieve high levels of <unk> , and not to define his work .
and if we 're going to transmit this now in the <unk> and medical range , there 's something that 's right now .
when you hear in television , what doctors and caregivers and also <unk> , and also the most vulnerable , it 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when you get accepted , what you 've done is that it 's going to be done , so it 's going to be paid for it , and if you 're not going to be paid , the medical service is , we do n't pay for the health or that medical treatment .
and through this documentary , but it will be more <unk> and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
a good friend of mine had gone now to holland , because he did n't want this to be more mature , who had a <unk> practice , has left up to be the doctor to be <unk> .
the <unk> are in these developments , and he 's a piece of construction , and he had the martin , had a little bit of old people down between the <unk> , hospital , and back , because the <unk> did n't know what they should do when it should be worse .
and then the hospital , will be a <unk> , go back to the <unk> , or <unk> , and they 're going to continue .
and this family had been thinking , if there 's a little bit more <unk> in holland , then i want to let me to run some of this <unk> of the <unk> and also <unk> <unk> from people .
now , in the way , in the netherlands , he had to find out , after he had learned the language with a lot better , that 's exactly what happened in this <unk> .
it 's also going to be more connected to die .
it 's not more the credibility that counts , but you put in one available , i want to be <unk> , or not in the hospital , if i am in the hospital .
and then the <unk> is .
in holland , it 's so , in the third days , a conversation is going to find a conversation with the moment , and then you have to put in the hospital , or i do n't want to be in the hospital , or i do n't want to be in the hospital if i want to happen .
that 's the same thing that i want to be , i want to be <unk> or i do n't want to be here .
and this data is going to go on a central and there 's this doctor in <unk> , and it 's still going to be the <unk> .
now , if we were looking at <unk> , which was a dance and even more alien , and we imagine , who would have an accident , i would n't want to be an accident , i would n't want to be able to be an accident , then you would be able to be a <unk> dance , where it 's going back to
and this raises my friend now , who 's sitting there in holland , too much more <unk> , as he is about it .
in the last , it 's so tribal today is about <unk> percent of the people who are not dying at home , but in hospitals , that 's the <unk> , and it 's also a lot of success , but it 's often the ideal habitats for old people , but it 's often a profound amount of
there 's a little bit of living , which is very good , there 's a very <unk> people who use , but if i look at the <unk> patients , and we 've got about <unk> patients in the year , so that 's why i would say , it 's very difficult to say it 's hard , it 's very difficult to be
and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , this is quite clear , which is quite clear , this entire quality of quality , is because the money of the money is not enough , and that the people are not enough to be able to say , and that the people are going to be able to say , and that people are going to say ,
this is not just the reality today , but you need two salaries in the <unk> and <unk> and most of it , and most of it 's only quite a little bit .
this introduction of quality of quality as a result of a constantly growing market , which you want to regulate , so they 're also looking at the individuals .
and now i 'm going to get out how to escape , so what do we do now in the last , because i 've got the first questions , and that 's the situation that is not the situation .
and there 's just the <unk> <unk> and the article one of me , because i think a society needs to have a society , also the <unk> structures , which is going to happen in our society .
and in the <unk> article one is , one would be <unk> .
and the second sentence there is , to protect them , is the <unk> .
and what i 'm not missing is a third sentence in the fact that every single one of the individual should have to have the assignment to protect its dignity and defend .
because that 's a way of <unk> itself from this case , i 'll give another way , and i 'm going to give me some of them in front of the way , and then i 'm not going to be a kind of thought of thinking about how i 'm going to die .
because the last thing is , even though , when we do n't like to talk to this subject , we 're going to come on the point .
hopefully a little bit of late or <unk> .
of course , i 'm also talking about my job , and i want to say , the wish i want to have to worry , but if it 's going to be a little bit , and if it 's a little bit , or even if you 're going to be a little bit , or even if it 's <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , to say , i 'm going to be late in life , i want to think about this question .
now , if you think about what 's doing about what 's doing my car , then you 're going to come on the next step , which are the five most important things in my life ?
there 's a book now , which is quite a <unk> <unk> .
and it 's the self-esteem , of course , it 's the friends i 've got to talk to me and exchange me , who know me and me know , and the <unk> of my life , it 's the <unk> .
it 's safe between people who i might have to do with , in the <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , or another person , where i have in relationship .
and there 's a lot of individual factors of course , of course , which is <unk> there , i do n't go through .
but when you look at these three points , you 've already have a whole bunch of tasks like you have to have a lot of life in life , to protect your own his own dignity .
and then another factor is that we have a certain cause of the <unk> of the <unk> , i got this one as a text as a text , or as an example .
other people can have these decisions for us and behavior , which is missing .
that 's my inner conviction .
our dignity can only come from us .
so it 's not the question , because other people who are doing , who 's going to give me who 's available , for me , for me , for me , or for me , for me , or for me , for me ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to ask , where can i work on people , where i could be able to do it , and my inside of it could be to be able to be involved in the way that i could deal with these questions , and i can handle it in the questions .
and if you 're going to say , as we 're going to work , so these inner quality , it was a way to say , i was looking at my inner inside of this mechanism .
because you ca n't want to give me a person to me , as i want to see myself and to see it .
and i do n't have to fit in a lot of <unk> or opinions who say , you 've got to get a steady <unk> , and because you 're so old ,
these questions that can probably be a long time in the last only <unk> , probably <unk> .
these would be a inner stance of the human body , which is in me , and who can not be supported by the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside , including the state that the state can not protect the government , and i could n't give me other people who are also <unk> , and i would have to have some of the people who have been on the ones that i 've got to have before , so that 's the way that i 've got to have
and to make these conversations , it 's kind of spaces , and there i think , and this talk , i 've been called these talk , this is the spaces like this in food , which is the same space that i have to be able to think about the things that 's not a conversation , but that 's a conversation
so if we 're old , if you 're old , you can say , well , a dance in may , despite my may , despite my very high age , which would be .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful nice evening .
i get two things with .
when you 're flat to flat , you 're a little bit more precise .
it 's a second .
let 's begin with infinite .
that 's stupid , not , you can take .
what do you mean ?
are there different <unk> ?
or is it infinitely enough ?
yeah .
this is not good when there 's one thing that looks !
so , in fact , but i 'll have it , for the ones who know it .
that 's exactly what we do .
we only have a single one .
and i <unk> to a little bit .
<unk> , we know , make infinite infinite form , we have to know a lot .
and it 's for the <unk> amount of magnitude of scale .
when we 're in the <unk> , and we count two <unk> in the other hand , in the other people .
we know , now , we 're looking at now , we 're looking at in the box , which is tiny , it 's three chairs and it 's three people .
we can check whether in each amount of the same amount of things that is ?
is how would we do it ?
so , that means , we would be first <unk> , one , two , we 're going to get the <unk> , we have three chairs , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three and three three .
that 's what i mean , yes ?
very nice .
this works in a fairly wonderful , which works in big numbers , although it 's <unk> .
but it fits .
how can you count it ?
how can you check that many people like chairs ?
i was aware of chairs and people and not what else .
yay !
you call the mate !
well , you know , this is clear , not , not , we 're in the everyday life , and we 've got to understand it !
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , it 's called <unk> a <unk> and it works as well , yes ?
you take one , you get a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , path , the next <unk> , everything is power , and there 's a lot of chairs , no chair , no chair , and the crowd are right ?
now we go into infinity .
how can we be two infinite tips ?
we would say that 's a big or bigger or bigger than others .
we could do it ?
we would start again .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is , if you 're going to count in a infinite long , yes , yeah , i would just say , do n't get to another .
<unk> , infinitely , is clear , <unk> ?
so , how is it ?
<unk> ?
no way , <unk> !
she was just going on .
mate !
so , let 's look at this .
estimate , you appreciate is bad , right ?
you see , you do n't see , yes , right ?
the point is that , you know , it 's quite easy .
if i take the <unk> , natural figures , <unk> , we have computers need to have zero , zero , one , two , four , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five ,
and we would say , let 's just say a replica of this <unk> , and let 's take the infinite copy of a lot of <unk> numbers .
left , the numbers are , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinitely long band of the natural <unk> , but on a band , the <unk> , the <unk> , on the other , on the other are the straight and the <unk> , okay ?
let 's call a lot of gs the straight numbers , we call the other amount of n the natural numbers .
what do you believe ?
is grams more powerful , is it bigger than n , or smaller or smaller ?
right ?
but that 's very soon , yes , is a lack of <unk> .
who are another estimate ?
little bit ?
who is getting bigger ?
ah , that 's no plan , yeah ?
that ca n't be , yeah ?
you ca n't find where what is missing , bigger , that 's not what ?
okay , you say smaller ?
would you suppose ?
this is the popular , what you might have , is of course .
and now , now i 'm going to explain why , the crowd are .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the linear <unk> , we take the zero from the natural amount of , you get out .
the next of the zero , after two , two , after the zero comes one , and i 'll get a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the eight , the four , yes ?
you can turn that , and then it 's doubling that 's obvious , <unk> ?
and it 's very clear through the <unk> , we create it that i 'm going to do it in the lecture .
and there 's one , there 's just the straight line on and the band is equal , yes ?
we <unk> the natural on the linear , <unk> , <unk> , and the band are still right .
this is just in infinite .
so , if you 're going to explain some of what we 've learned today , even if you 've learned , yeah , what 's infinite , i know ?
there 's a infinite quality , which is a quality , which is there 's not and this trait , is absolute <unk> , a real subset that 's exactly as big .
and that 's what you do not , if you put out of three three people , it 's just one there , and they were three .
yes , we 've done infinity .
none of all ?
okay .
then we have a second part , probability .
the professionals , possible probability .
here 's what i 'm here .
now , in this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's at least at least a third , and you know it makes someone who has on it , yes ?
so , let 's call the doors a , b , c .
i 've got behind anything , i hope you would n't hear it .
and you have to have a little bit of guess .
where my mind , i have a little bit hidden , behind a , b or c ?
guess what , our <unk> , here .
they estimate c .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has a idea ?
no , <unk> , b is missing , not , otherwise , you do n't know , yeah ?
that 's right .
it 's really no matter , so you do n't need to be my , three letters , and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really anyway , yes ?
it 's completely clear because , because , the chance you know , is that you 've got lucky , it 's very good at a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really no matter , right ?
now , here 's what i 'm doing is , i just do one .
well , i know , of course , where it 's .
<unk> , this has someone who has <unk> .
so , i know , yes , where it 's , and the guess , and the guess what you call it , or whatever you call it 's a second round .
so i 'm really proud of the game i 'm going to tell you now , i 'm just <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , now , i suppose i was looking at a , <unk> ?
so , now i have to show a door behind behind it 's not , and they did n't say .
because if you say b , and i say , and i know it 's not behind b .
there would n't be a second round .
and then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , good luck .
but i need to do that , it 's <unk> , in the second round .
so i can just give a open , behind it 's not just not , but what you did n't have told .
now , the question is , and that 's the kind of probability of the condition , under the condition , under the condition , under the condition of the condition , which is that b is open , and it 's not that it 's not behind .
you 're allowed to stay in a stay , i 'm really excited .
i 'm going to do what you want .
or you say , i do c .
now the <unk> is now getting more likely to know ?
protocell , very nice , b is on , i know it 's behind c .
or , but , but , god is that b is being open , i always wanted to stay in a stay .
or would you say , `` well , we 've got to have , <unk> , way , we 've only have two doors , it does n't matter or remain .
what do you mean ?
it 's not anyway .
<unk> .
why is n't it anyway ?
very nice .
why is it <unk> ?
yes , right , that 's wrong .
that 's what it looks like , when we had yesterday , <unk> ?
but so they are , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , the thing that is really <unk> , yes .
the understanding of all , i do n't know , do n't know , six and , yes , i 'm not going to be able to go back , otherwise i 'm not going to come back to a second .
so there 's all of everyone .
behind this door , it 's a third .
and it 's always just a third behind a door .
you can guess what you want you to have with two thirds of the <unk> .
and that means you could have to think of two doors , not , you ca n't have in <unk> , you can put in two dozen , it 's <unk> , if you get the zero , which is all right ?
but here we have a door .
so , the thing is , two thirds is not what you do .
so the two third here is , but it can only be behind one door !
it 's not .
so , what 's more likely ?
no way , i really hid .
so , what is more likely ?
it 's better to remain or move ?
now it 's easy , right ?
yes , of course .
so that was n't hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what do we see ?
you 've had a <unk> .
why ?
easy , two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between theory and practice .
i hope it was for each other .
thank you .
mr. <unk> , you know , she 's <unk> <unk> <unk> who 's just a bad diet and bad food and poor food and overweight people who has heard a lot of
but i 'm betting my best , that it 's gone .
i 'm coming from <unk> farm and knew until i was 12 .
this is the process , right .
yeah .
thank you for inviting us .
i grew up here in the ground .
and i do n't know if mr. <unk> <unk> was so on me , if i want to talk to ted in the lake , and talk to a particular note .
i 've got to trust me , and that 's the topic .
now , motivation , motivation is not bad and i <unk> me the woman who said , perhaps , maybe one or another , more sports .
i also have a whole thing .
so tonight is now going to go to the morning and you have a lot of <unk> , but i 've got to go tomorrow in fact , because i 'm going to go in three weeks at the <unk> june , in <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i 'm going to give you tomorrow in the rain .
so who wants to go , <unk> , tomorrow 's day , in the <unk> , i 'm going to <unk> all a thank you .
i 've got to say , briefly , i 'm going to trust the subject .
and i started , you know , extra , with the subject .
you do n't worry about the nice , little <unk> , the blind , <unk> to come from afterwards .
i had a little bit of thinking about this , when i am <unk> , how do i think about the best where i am ?
so , i come from <unk> village with six houses , many <unk> , a few <unk> , and in my parents on the farm , there 's apple apples , and what you do out of <unk> .
trust , in sports , of course , not in the <unk> .
why do i tell the story where i am ?
for me , one of the most important stories that i really have been so right in the country , from the village and grew up with two great brothers , with the elders brother , the <unk> .
and with the second brother , the same is as i am .
it 's called the light and dark , which can see how i just see where <unk> windows in the room , whether it 's light or out .
so what 's very practical is for the <unk> .
the thing , or we can both see when we have something like something .
<unk> <unk> , but i always say , `` i ca n't tell you , is <unk> <unk> .
for the subject of the old men , <unk> .
it 's always going to be over here .
and what 's really important is , but what was really important is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , is , of course , the fact , is already the fact , and you 've got to trust this great trust , which is all the great trust , that 's what we need to do , is that we need to be a little bit of
and i mean , it was definitely my parents that you know , like many of you , my brother , and i did n't know a blind .
we were so the first thing that all of the lives are locked in their lives .
and then they had to do from the situation .
and now , i 'm going to say , it 's a lot of happiness that my parents had to have all the whole day and to provide us back to us , and say , there 's a wall , because there 's a little wall , and then can you feel like you can feel like you .
a would have been uncomfortable -- we have fallen to home .
and b <unk> , our parents of us to go to the beginning of going to go on , where we could n't get it in the backyard , and our <unk> brother is .
so , in the house alone , the <unk> and <unk> .
there 's the blind brother i put in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> the <unk> , i still have this .
so this is the great brothers -- they 're not just good for the elbow and the <unk> .
and our brothers and my brothers and my brothers , and i was so excited to be <unk> in the <unk> farm , which is what you could do , for example , in the <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> brother began with three years , and then we wanted -- michael and i .
and then we started to drive with <unk> , like many little kids , today , this is <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> .
but we 've started that with <unk> , at some time .
and then the big question is : how does the act ?
and how do you do that , one of the faith , the faith of parents , that the kids are still going to fall back and <unk> and the trust of us , and the trust of us and the trust of us that we are not permanently .
and our answer was that we have a <unk> of our parents , where are the <unk> , which is a car where <unk> <unk> , you know , there 's no longer <unk> , which is n't going to do it , there 's no way .
and we had to <unk> in between in between in between the one of the hand , but the other people also looks like .
and that 's what you ca n't have here in here , unfortunately , because it 's going to be there as loud that you do n't know anything .
but <unk> ' night , when you get light up , and in your bedroom , and on whose bedroom , then they 're going to respond to the bedroom .
and you can try to cross the tongue with the tongue with the tongue , and they 're going to see that , in us , they 're just like bats -- they 'll hear a resistance .
so how the bats are so <unk> , they 're also going to hear the <unk> wall , <unk> resistance because the sound is going to be different .
and that 's for me to trust me , so it 's also faith in the movement .
but also , <unk> high levels of high school , and the security is , i 've got a chance to help me to help me .
and i 'm looking at the <unk> of a lot of trouble and clear , even without a lot of accidents , of course , of course , of course .
now , what i 'm not doing now , now i 'm not doing some images now , which is that i 'm very <unk> , from one of our <unk> .
and that 's the end of the ocean on our higher building on a long <unk> .
i wrote a title , and i grew up to a <unk> increase .
and i 've been very literally because i was as a person who has a person who have been too much later in the <unk> and in the <unk> in the scientific side to trust the science of the science and in the <unk> in the scientific side , and i 've never had that remarkable how i 've ever met it .
you might have ever read the same .
but i 've also have to do that , of course , of course , there is no one of all of them , of course .
diversity is in the figure of the ability of our strength with the <unk> , to know where i am good , what i 'm doing , and where can i mean , really , really , very much more <unk> ?
and our brother only again , who has michael and me and me and mine took on roofs from the house .
so then , then , okay , we <unk> a <unk> .
there 's where you get somewhere else , the <unk> window from the <unk> .
and the <unk> was then <unk> , michael and i 've got a little bit more like the girl 's girl : <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but in the end , who is going to end up ?
so i do n't .
and i think the other people , we 're the generation of the young women there , too .
and of course , i 'm still going to go .
and then , the consequence was that we were at all three <unk> <unk> in the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top , and the dad would be <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and i did n't know what to say .
because , of course , is , of course , is , of course , if other details .
so the father 's father would have said to be , to god , help help help us have been a lot of the danger of us have been a fear of us that one of us have been <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't know .
but never happened .
and he had to be <unk> that he had just slowly <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , who has come up .
and that 's what i was very great that we had these opportunities .
but yeah , no concern is not a requirement , no effective , to make a <unk> .
for me , the different sports who were important in my life , all , is interesting .
and all of all , they were all <unk> because i could see , where did my boundaries , what are my <unk> .
so to <unk> good <unk> , i could never be able to be .
i never had the <unk> .
and i 'm not going to go to it .
i 'm going to go out to rain .
now it 's not at five level as well .
and in <unk> rain -- but still rather than inside .
but i 've always been able to believe that to trust me in my open , and i discovered that i tried to try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try to try and try and try .
first , for example , <unk> .
and that was very beautiful , because the coach , there was a <unk> who had in the <unk> , said , ok , we have <unk> kids , but send back to the <unk> of the blind children .
well , i 'm all right now , because you 're playing with each other , you know ,
and then you realize what the other power is .
and there 's my big trust , of course , when i 'm going to be a long time , it 's hard to be difficult , but then the other might make what i do n't do .
so there 's one method , and this is the trust in my speed .
and the other hand put a foot in the <unk> , let me go backwards itself .
i 'm not going to see it .
i was thinking about it , but i had <unk> .
i think that 's a little bit more boring .
and that 's not a volunteer , right ?
<unk> .
<unk> , i 'm sure .
okay .
the next thing for me was important as a sports kid , and then , the <unk> and <unk> .
my parents were home , or they 're <unk> , and they taught us to teach us as children .
but for me , i was very important in school , how can i move to school for school , to get rid of my excess energy ?
and there was a way i had a way to be in school in school .
and even i 've always thought , this is all <unk> boring , because it 's rather than the <unk> , i 'm going to be <unk> .
i found that in -- i 'm not going to do it .
i 've got to have said , well , i do with <unk> .
and then , the first thing , you 've realized , man , again , this is the great diversity of stuff in the sport , because you need <unk> , you need to make a good good talk ,
<unk> -- you have a lot of work in their work ?
this is what it 's in the <unk> .
you 'll just get a little bit , if you have the full trust in your own technology .
if you have the trust in the own power -- so the power , you also have the same conditions , the bad weather , the soft snow .
and when you do it in my case in the team .
because as a <unk> , which is nothing , of course , of course , of course , <unk> <unk> .
and i 've never been never done something like this , and i 've got to use the word -- my <unk> -- there 's only one -- i 've done my exercise .
but nothing , we do it again .
and i 'm going to give you a little bit of it now .
you know , one of you , one of you , another exercise .
so what i do is to do with the topic of trust , which is the exercise i 'm going to give you the audience just like the audience just like it is like it , if you do n't see anything to make a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , you have two sticks in the hand .
so , of course , yeah , i do n't give hand more free , otherwise i could take a <unk> .
do n't .
so i need to help me .
i then put my <unk> in front of me .
and the message is telling me the voice .
so you have to do something that 's going to be <unk> .
and it 's important for trust .
the obvious thing in communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> says i 'm always telling me , when it 's <unk> , '' which says `` <unk> , '' that says , `` the left on the left , i know it 's easy to left , so on the upper part of the <unk> .
when he says , on the left on the left , on the left , and when he says , on the right .
okay , everybody understood ?
and then <unk> problem , because i need to do again , and then i need to do it again , or he has to correct me , and then i know , what 's not .
and for me , it 's very big , most important , if the <unk> in front of me , i have to really have to really get the really <unk> to say it .
to say , he 's positive , and it 's for me to me the tools that it allows me to be very quickly and then <unk> it and also going to be faster than others , the same competition .
and that can only do when i 'm going to do it , with two poor , to stand up , and i have to make the eyes of making a eyes -- <unk> , or ca n't open up .
and then you have to do this , and then you have to go to the other leg and just like that , and you can get a little bit more precise , but have to be quite quiet .
also , high .
yes , and that 's the key idea of me , when i 'm going to say , you know , how to say , i 'm going to say , `` i say , `` oh , i had just men as a <unk> , and hey , you 've got to say , `` hey , you 've got to make the right <unk> , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's clear , because it 's obvious .
so i do n't know what to tell me .
so i 'm the one that 's going to open up the path to communication .
and this is like in each <unk> .
if someone does n't know my needs , of course , of course , he ca n't help me , but i have to say , well , i need to say , `` well , i need to win from you from you the curve earlier . ''
or i need to have a practice of you like the <unk> , you know , you know , the mountain is still , because if we 're going to get the <unk> <unk> , and you have to be over .
and again , again , it 's just <unk> and the thing is not listening to .
and then i also have a little bit of the pilot , as the wheel is at <unk> , on <unk> <unk> , who told me , unfortunately , we decided to have a little bit of six minutes behind us , and so we took up with <unk> minutes -- then it 's a little bit of
so that 's why it 's important to have the idea of <unk> <unk> .
i 'm listening to <unk> -- here is another thing that are <unk> <unk> ?
who is more ?
so my best time has been faster , but this was in april , and now , i 've never been saying it 's too much faster than <unk> .
and in the moment of the moment , <unk> .
and for me , as i said , these are the kind of <unk> , only if i just get my ears .
and the other one of me explain what he looks like to see , and i 'm like that way , my risks is perfect .
and that 's one of the most important things that i say , `` trust is rather , and not the <unk> <unk> .
so , wait for the blind case , not as much of it , frankly , from the <unk> .
because i 've also had the experience that i had a <unk> on the right and on the left .
and then that was bad at the competition because it 's next to three feet .
and i 'm the three yards just <unk> .
so , as i said , you know , this was <unk> , of course , <unk> .
i also know , i also know , because the <unk> <unk> need to turn up , so you have to get <unk> .
and i 'm going to be able to be able to realize that people say , to me , the left and say , `` <unk> , the other left .
so , then , there was the right , sadly .
it 's not a lot of your day-to-day life often .
but yeah , in <unk> situation , you know , you probably know all of the work of work or the university when it has to go .
then , of course , of course , obviously , often <unk> difficult challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` i mean , <unk> trust is trust i need to know the risks .
and i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to say , i have to be honest , i 'm like someone who ca n't see , relatively big in the advantage , because i 'm betting my risks in many ways .
so i 'm going to <unk> all of the <unk> .
and from the driving tree , from the fall , from falling down , which i know , but of course , i know , but of course , and i 'm <unk> , but that 's the important thing -- but i also <unk> the good pages .
which is also going to be achieved when the trust is there .
and if you 've found somebody who is actually a hundred percent of how i need it .
and with all , i have the same goals .
because this is in the subject of me , the next thing is , very important .
you need the same goal , and i need to see what 's going to be really , just trust ?
because it 's often <unk> faster , which you use .
i trust it or the or myself .
but that 's what it 's really important is that it 's too much .
that you have to trust it .
and that you also -- because we 're going to meet people with <unk> <unk> -- we want to see <unk> sense .
and the sense of the sense that is very often that we 're also able to achieve <unk> goal together .
that 's where we do it -- for example , from some , four , i went to the <unk> .
and i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , you know , i 'm just saying , i have to look at anybody here , which i can do in the case that i 'm just going to get this mountain up .
and how do you get in the mountain in the end , you know ?
now , yeah , i had one advantage of the advantage , i did n't see some things , if it 's next to me of a hundred meters .
then i was relatively <unk> .
can be an advantage of advantage , fear is not a problem .
and i 've been working on the fear of fear and i 've been working with fear of the <unk> , now i ran out of the <unk> , and then i went to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , there 's <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
now , this is a little bit more <unk> , when you look at the bottom and down the cars , you do n't need to see a lot of a lot to see there , it 's going to hurt if i 'm <unk> .
and these things are always interesting for me .
now , you know , also , also , also , too <unk> , but you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , `` hey , i think of the war in the way , i 'm looking at it so yes , and you can just have a new new new experience .
and that 's a little bit of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , because at <unk> mountain , you go to the day , you 're just 10 hours , and it 's just going to be just
and you 're going to go , and it 's just stones around , still less plants .
you 're looking at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and you 've got the first world cup .
so if you see <unk> de <unk> , the <unk> of the last , the <unk> .
this is how the only exciting thing .
we 've seen the messages away from the distance or the other .
so , of course , i 've got a lot of trust faith in the <unk> -- despite the <unk> <unk> that he had .
because i thought , well , well , well , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so , so
but as i said , it 's otherwise quite <unk> , because you 're not going to be a lot of change now .
and it 's really exciting , then it 's going to be a little bit more difficult to be hard .
so when you go into the height and the air is thinner .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , if you have <unk> little <unk> , where it 's on the left and on the right .
and then , it 's too beautiful and when it 's still night , and all of the <unk> , and then at the <unk> , and then he 'd say , `` now he would like me to get the rope around and then have me in the handle .
because i was like to be <unk> with <unk> , and then it was too <unk> .
and i 've created that , we 've been able to say , `` well , i mean , of course , my mother , my friend , my friend , my friend , i 've got to trust a hundred percent , and we 've got this before .
but i also need to make a <unk> form of security , so i do n't need to focus because , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you imagine , you know , if you imagine , if you 're going to tell you to the mountain all the mountain on the right ?
there 's a little bit of <unk> , and that 's all of them .
so for us , for us , we 've been trust in the case , we 're looking for <unk> connection , so , so we got a rope on your backpack , which had me in the hand , and then i ran out behind her , and then
in the other <unk> , i was also <unk> that i had a little bit of the <unk> .
and she 's just going to end up with the foot on the foot , and it 's <unk> with her <unk> <unk> , that i just knew what to be in the same way .
and what the whole thing i 've shown all of it 's how beautiful it is , of course , if you see , then there 's the top of the top step , that the goal is really going to get up and lower , like the <unk> .
but in the other hand , it 's also that i realized that trust is that i 've got to me in me , that is the answer to me , if i really have the top of the goal , ''
but the trust is also in other people , the <unk> , as trust .
and when we 're <unk> at night , we were in the group , we were in the group , and there 's the rest of us , and there were the other seven students , and there was a very close behind us , and i 've got to get a break behind us and i 've thought , `` tell me , and tell me , why you can look at the way , and tell you , why you can look at this , and
you ca n't look at the boys in the back .
this is kind of not the reason .
and then i realized , ah , yeah , yeah , that trust is in their ability to be quite <unk> .
you 're going to go through the dark , you go to 12 o'clock at 12 o'clock , there 's no light .
this is completely <unk> , when you 're <unk> , the air is thin , so it 's just a little bit more and so far more .
and then there 's the moment where the wait for you have said , `` yes , that was actually completely <unk> , behind you , because the friend of me told me is all of me , we 've got constantly <unk> -- how women are going to do .
have the whole night we talked about something , and the other people in the group had exactly something like this , and there was the <unk> to know , ok , ok , it 's just <unk> hour that has told me .
or i did n't tell you what the mountain is told .
and that 's what you know , it 's still somebody who might not be bad at about it , maybe we 've just talked about it , and it 's just more than the sun goes on .
and that things that you see , this is the same thing that can be able to be able to trust itself , and can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and for me , all of all , is that trust is , and then , all of all , yeah , if you 're going to be a personal gold box , and what you 're really going to be really , then in the idea of the idea .
this is , of course , in sports , you know , the gold , in the sport , you know , i do n't know why the surgery do -- maybe i do n't know , to find the value or see whether it 's appropriate ?
so , i think , some of these are , it 's so much like vancouver , it 's hard to do six grams .
if that would be real gold , i 'm not here , then i would be on the <unk> .
or at least , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i think the real thing you know , why you do that , is more that you can imagine , what i 'm actually created is , and how did i build my skills and forces on a point .
so how did i have in my skills , but of course of the team that we all need , whether in the study , in what else .
anyway , old man or young woman , we need people too , too .
and then , if we have this aim in the head , and then there 's the best proof , that 's the best proof that we could trust in a project in our lives .
and if you can get it , it can be honest in other areas .
thank you very much .
one science for me , this is the title of my talk , which led to <unk> of her beautiful maps .
what i 'm looking for me is the very <unk> effort that <unk> the sciences as a <unk> in the general population .
basically , i could be content .
when i put in a <unk> <unk> , there 's all <unk> to the literature for scientific topics , which is <unk> .
even each other <unk> , there 's a range of <unk> <unk> , magazines , <unk> , where scientific themes , <unk> themes , kind of different things .
everybody 's called at least a <unk> , where kind of scientific themes are processing .
even , this is completely <unk> when you look at what it is in magazines and <unk> for children with scientific subjects .
and every program has already sort of an easier foot in the <unk> , but yet that 's a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that i want to see , i 'd like to look at that , but i want to read , but that 's not what that 's not true .
cool , cool is just a sort of cool in <unk> , in <unk> , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
in <unk> , a <unk> five minutes , has nothing with the reality , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there 's where i can identify .
big bang <unk> , because i can laugh , i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great .
this is extremely sad .
because that 's kind of paradox , which is a little paradox that are going to be in the future , and we have to deal with these problems of technology and issues .
but at the same time , no one of them did n't in oneself .
i 've got a few little bit of little examples of how science or science is just a place .
a very <unk> example : in london , you built a beautiful tower , <unk> , <unk> , the architect , we 're building this sort of <unk> .
what happens is what happens is now , the sunlight of the top of the facade , is that the sunlight of the facade , i got a <unk> <unk> , focused on the other side of a point .
that was a big deal by the press , unfortunately , unfortunately .
so the heat , the heat has so <unk> that poor poor , who has really long , long , there are the <unk> path .
there is a architect , a architect , who did n't have a little bit like this in physics because i mean , is completely new , that 's a mirror .
so what i found is , quite new , is <unk> in front of the <unk> christ , where he used to beat a <unk> down .
now , i really wonder what has the more design or architect or what did he studied ?
this is a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is how to create such a <unk> , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , this is now a few years ago , as a kind of thing that 's been in the media .
there was the train in <unk> , because <unk> changed , it was a danger .
genes was <unk> with green <unk> .
genes were kind of bad .
<unk> , oh , there are genes inside .
there were situations where there was in the market in the market , and hey , hey , i have <unk> vegetables .
no idea what 's supposed to be , yes .
so , yeah , okay , the german tomatoes , we have to discuss it .
but at the time , i was in the lab , and i was absolutely frustrated , because i tried to get these evil genes in my bacteria , this <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my <unk> neighbor : <unk> , you do n't see happy , but not happy , what 's going on ?
i 'm like , yes , i 'm trying to transform the three gene in my bacteria and do n't work .
now , this was what i 've tried to explain , so kind of a <unk> , genes , i thought , you know , the good lady , if i talk about genes , you 've already have what she means .
that was what i really meant , so one sequence that i wanted to get in these <unk> <unk> .
but that was what the woman has gone .
this woman never sent me back !
who knows what i 'm doing it , <unk> ?
genes are bad .
now that 's good 10 years ago , and yet it 's kind of in consciousness .
genes that 's bad .
i 'm not just read a long time .
and then there 's another gene , and it 's going to be <unk> in our language .
<unk> would be in europe , was a headline .
there is a different component of other corn , which contains no genes .
another headline , <unk> , <unk> rats are dying earlier .
yes , that was a beautiful headline .
but these are not so old , and it 's also not even more anyway , what are i available .
anyway , whether the time or the picture , all about <unk> .
luckily , it 's still not <unk> in the <unk> , but i 'm afraid , and i 'm not too long .
but that just showing what uncertainty is in the population because they 're just not in the issues .
we have to be interested in our future with these technologies .
now , just <unk> , no one had the big on the subject , but it will be done about things and elected the most people have no idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
how is that information from the lab ?
if we suppose that little , young , young scientists , a experiment , a experiment , a experiment , <unk> something , beautiful and good , and he 's going to be good , and it 's true ,
then the first thing to go to the professor .
the boss , who decides , you do n't want to say okay , okay , cool subject , your name is on the name of a <unk> , which is always important in science .
good idea , i 'm still not in the public , it 's a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> thought , oh , great idea , class , there 's a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> with a project , a nice idea , and then that comes from the <unk> .
it 's going to <unk> , but what 's actually ?
now these studies are rarely alone , typically , have a shared <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all of these , the <unk> , which is the right <unk> projects , then you get over the <unk> , whether it 's <unk> , whether it 's <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
that 's the way .
from the basis , it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the ground in order to the really , very cool experiments , which are really <unk> in these <unk> .
these are good at <unk> , who are really good , there 's all of all of them , yes , yes , but who can i get ?
it 's basically the ones who are interested in .
in the <unk> , we are always called the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , the <unk> are interested in , which is the <unk> , yes , beautiful and good .
nice magazine , finally , the audience who are interested in for that , who might have about a idea where <unk> comes in this article .
who 's the <unk> i really do ?
the <unk> who are interested in .
the <unk> , that was now yes , the <unk> <unk> , i call him mr. <unk> <unk> , who read it under circumstances of circumstances , i tried to think it 's trying to be neutral .
and yet , again , our future are going to be the way we can be able to be able to find ourselves together .
fracking , <unk> , renewable energy , <unk> , these are all things that are <unk> , but not really understand the <unk> and not really understand .
my project , my idea is , i mean , is so different , which is different , these little young , young scientists out of the <unk> , very completely entirely completely totally completely <unk> of their regular <unk> , and to give it there , a seminar in how to communicate .
so what 's mostly happened is that a scientist , i 've got a buddy , we 've been talking about good two years , and it 's <unk> , it 's not to ask him to the job .
as soon as he told the mouth , and over his job , he 's telling us .
<unk> , these are scientists who tell you about a <unk> .
<unk> , sounds like this , <unk> , <unk> , it 's already almost as well as genes .
<unk> treated , it 's kind of , oh , you do n't know what 's behind .
and the real time , again , again , it 's nice , which is nice and good , if you 're on a conference , and you know , your people , your <unk> , you want to tell you from <unk> something , but you know , just
where is the problem really <unk> and normal ?
so i school , this is my idea , these young scientist who are not so far in the hierarchy of the hierarchy , which is a little bit of malleable to school , how to be impressive .
this is a use of all , <unk> , but anyway , investors who want to see what happens in the <unk> .
and finally , the name of the tax tax , who are being used to be used to be able to communicate .
but the training , this is just one story .
i also want to put you a jury , and i want to give you a <unk> , and you want to introduce her project , her project , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , even worse , it 's not : kids .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if this is real , of albert einstein : if you ca n't explain it , you do n't really understand it .
so , the scientists of the lab , and you know , to begin to rethink the project , how can i be able to communicate that really normal .
that 's how there are several stories .
now , <unk> are totally modern , in each university , common , but i 'll get the <unk> .
who is the <unk> of the end of the city in the university of the city in the university of the city in the university of the city in the university of the city , going to <unk> a talk over here ?
these are the ones that are anyway .
i got my <unk> .
so , these are the people who are interested in doing this , who are going to listen to there and hear two talks .
that 's nice , there 's a <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> are all , all are happy , and it 's it .
so i 'm going to put in a second one point , say it 's not there in this <unk> project .
these scientists are still immune , how <unk> are kids ?
because many really <unk> have to reduce the most important .
because scientists , like the research , and how kids are exploring their world , are identical .
children are very sophisticated .
they do something like that .
you try to try and make it work ?
<unk> , fall down , no way , do n't work , the next piece , i change a few parameters .
kids learn very sophisticated .
these are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> what the factors i need to change , or not .
this is normal !
but that 's a lot of <unk> .
and of course , i think that 's really , if you get the <unk> , and these scientists in the neighborhood , in the environment , in the environment , from school , from school in school , from school , in school , in school , in school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , with the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school , in the school ,
and then you might have , maybe at some point , this is my hope , telling me the kids , and then i get to mr. <unk> , who also talk to scientific topics , because children 's kids
so this is not somewhere in the newspaper , which is not somewhere in galileo , but his kids tell him something that it has a bread with a <unk> <unk> , that it has a bread in a <unk> , and then it 's also a bread , and then it 's also a sense of being able to build a house .
and it 's not just to me , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , <unk> <unk> , but also the <unk> .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just about that , the first <unk> , said , `` yes , '' said , `` well , <unk> for our scientists , '' that 's not right now , which is not right now .
a scientist must not communicate .
yes , i think , okay , okay , i call the next one .
but who 's going to work in a department of a department , <unk> is in a company , which is the next break .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
you ca n't have a day .
the last few weeks , were awful .
the weather has made us a big line of the bill .
seven , seven years ago , eight years , i was asked if i 'd like to take this .
i was in <unk> , nearly 10 years , at the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and in <unk> .
we have come up to the top .
had <unk> <unk> .
and for me , this was actually , well , that 's what it 's <unk> .
what is that ?
<unk> , this is actually ridiculous .
but i have learned that one of the things , and that 's why i am here today .
and maybe it might be a little bit crazy , but it 's too emotionally .
it 's beautiful and it 's exciting and it 's great fun .
and i 'll just tell you in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes , a little bit of this life of a <unk> .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
the company has been done for a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company has been in two years .
and the <unk> of the <unk> .
the company has been over about <unk> or <unk> years .
it 's the zeppelin here at the <unk> .
marcus .
one image i want to show you here , which is a little bit of right , which is actually a red , so a <unk> on it , or something that 's too big .
there 's the world 's largest <unk> .
and it 's actually just 10 active .
that 's what you see .
there 's about six thousand active active active active active .
so that 's actually not a market .
it 's not even a unique .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also : why do you do that ?
how does that go ?
in fact , it was 10 active , because we can talk about this later , and this is how this is .
quite a short story .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
very quick .
has fallen to 14 14 in the first world war in the world .
then in the first world war , <unk> <unk> had died by <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> was built for <unk> .
and then there was london , and so on and so forth .
and when we 've got <unk> and eight to london , and with a big <unk> , there 's a <unk> project , the english campaign , the english newspapers were filled with the <unk> of the <unk> , but it 's not going to be <unk> .
so the story has been in <unk> .
and we had a wrong campaign .
but <unk> , the customer was n't so much , because all of the sudden , it 's going to see what there was there , which had the old memories in there .
and you know , it was a little bit more critical .
but in london , there was a good campaign in london except the weather in the north , many years ago , many years ago , many years ago , very much and very <unk> .
and we 're not a lot .
then <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and has a <unk> list that has been delivered after america .
this has a myth that has fallen in the entire german nation , which is a little bit of felt as a <unk> and <unk> .
there was in new york , with <unk> .
and the whole german nation has been <unk> , we 're back who are again .
this is in all the <unk> , and that 's really the idea of this myth of this device .
but actually , until <unk> and <unk> , only five , six , seven , seven , seven , <unk> were built , and actually just two right , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> that have <unk> the passengers .
passengers , hundred , where about <unk> passengers and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> in the time , the first live vehicle was <unk> , unfortunately , unfortunately .
next to the titanic , where one looks like a icon , a product , and then it 's never going to be done more .
the other way were also hired .
and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> the last time .
the materials are used to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it was nothing about <unk> years .
and then had the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the zeppelin who had the idea , maybe it should begin to begin .
and i was hired to <unk> , because you 've developed a great product that has been developed , but that 's the market .
yes , is he a market ?
what is there in ?
so .
we now talk about it .
the <unk> <unk> , that might be a moment to explain , and it 's <unk> , <unk> , people have done a lot .
there are a lot of firms that ran out of this <unk> .
there are <unk> employees , about six billion dollars .
this is a real economy , for <unk> .
there 's a lot of behind .
and there 's also convinced me here .
the zeppelin is actually a regular plane like each other airplane , but it 's sorry , excuse me a gas , helium , helium , <unk>
is like a whale that 's on the water , and there 's <unk> , and there 's got to make the <unk> .
now , the time is not going to explain this in detail .
inside , a zeppelin looks like a structure .
there 's two kinds of <unk> .
there are <unk> <unk> , which are we , <unk> in the case and <unk> .
there 's no fabric , and they are like <unk> in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> of the world who have been built in the world .
and of course , there 's only how i said earlier , just <unk> in the insisted of our own insisted , so about once .
that 's what the production is going to be brought up when a bone is <unk> .
on the left , the structure again .
and the bone is also <unk> .
come from the <unk> .
<unk> : the astronauts of the astronauts .
it 's the origins , the origins are .
one point is , one point of two million dollars as a bone .
and it has to be <unk> , and it has to be <unk> , because it has to be <unk> , because you have to see , and again , you have to see , you have to see when it 's going to be a map in a hole or a hole that it 's not easy .
and there 's the <unk> again , and they 're looking at just looking at whether it 's going to be in holes .
and the end of the end is a <unk> without the south korea is like this .
so the zeppelin is technically a <unk> product .
and that 's where you see here at the bottom , very quickly .
one point nine percent , one point of a point nine percent , one point of six percent <unk> , which is called a thousand thousand to about 10 thousand <unk> .
this is very little and very good .
this is a <unk> .
it can see .
but there 's another trend that 's been involved in the moment , and i have shown up here .
we had three years ago , three years ago , when i started <unk> five , eight years ago , eight years ago , <unk> percent , and last year ago .
and this year in may , we were at <unk> percent .
if you 're the eight years , my eight years of <unk> and <unk> of it , you know , at least , in these eight years , of course , of course , of course , a <unk> of the <unk> , of course , in this eight years , the five years of
we are <unk> .
we ca n't get passengers through fog .
you want to see something .
and the <unk> or <unk> are actually going to be launched every year .
so a little picture of the weather is that our weather does n't just felt like , but statistically , because we do weather every day .
but because this is so good , the <unk> has a program <unk> <unk> , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i 'm going to come from finland today .
the <unk> is connecting here is a flying lab .
<unk> is called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the earth and <unk> feet .
it 's called <unk> .
and the zeppelin <unk> flies from italy to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
a lot of many hundred dollars of <unk> and analyze the air of the air , how they 're in the air , how to react to our things we do on the ground .
there 's what i 'm going to explain , there 's the second <unk> .
a great assignment .
and it 's when you want to make a sense of <unk> in the subject .
so this is very good .
and here 's a couple of <unk> .
the <unk> about sweden was last week or <unk> week .
and in finland , by the way , the weather is great , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> are saying that they had never had .
i 've never met wonderful , nice warm days .
the killing were n't as bad .
we were also in africa .
and have been looking for de <unk> <unk> , used to be <unk> volcanoes that are gone from millions of years .
just you can ask , you know , it 's also , that 's all africa , if you ask a sense of questions , after a idea of questions , it 's a sense of questions , it 's the idea of meaning in the cinema in the cinema , the movie was going to be <unk> in the movie ,
i wondered , well , what do we do ?
and what do we do that ?
and at the end , we were still done in two years .
and the <unk> did n't end up .
the whole <unk> came back in the time , and then the project was stopped .
and a tornado had the zeppelin at the mast in the mast that he could be in the bottom .
but was n't so bad .
we had very good insurance , and they were actually quite happy .
and that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what i should do .
yes , what we do today is a very quick <unk> of the <unk> .
what we do today , it 's about it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or insisted .
what we 're doing today is the <unk> in <unk> here .
we do <unk> .
we have to get the zeppelin .
<unk> is called aging .
there are still a little bit of devices inside , and we 've got to take a little bit of 10 , and you 've got to go home again .
we 're just replacing the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
and with the customer , we 're going to talk about it .
we have to do the things all the time .
we 're an journalist <unk> , which are controlled by the german <unk> and from the european areas of the european muslim , and all the time , with <unk> , like <unk> or <unk> .
this is also <unk> and costs money , and it 's still going to continue .
the question is , is you going on ?
do you want to develop ?
do you make bigger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what do you do ?
you continue to go in the market ?
is you going to continue ?
and that 's what we have , of course , in my time .
and there are some <unk> <unk> .
and by the way , the <unk> <unk> ran a couple of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
at the beginning , on the <unk> , there was the <unk> of <unk> .
the german population has saved him in the end of six million <unk> , when a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he was basically broke the population of a donation .
and from the <unk> <unk> , and the other companies came out , and we do n't have <unk> or <unk> , and i would n't have any other businesses and other companies would be there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and they were listening to san francisco with a customer .
there was a very <unk> <unk> .
both projects are sadly .
so <unk> .
at the same time , we won <unk> .
there 's no picture that i ca n't show up because we could n't show the <unk> .
but in america , now , the first <unk> of the first <unk> are going to be done .
we sold three piece .
and with <unk> , we 're developing a partner in a partner also a technology .
and that 's a big success , but that 's the defeat .
two customers are basically <unk> , because it did n't go .
why did n't it ?
we actually know .
either the location was not the right or the passengers had to be <unk> , or in america , in america , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , `` the last 30 attack of years who have done advertising .
the <unk> people have <unk> , you 've seen the <unk> , have said , `` <unk> , again , the power of advertising .
there is no idea that you did n't know that you could <unk> there .
and it was actually twice the marketing in marketing : hey , people call and flies .
<unk> .
the pilot to transport in the year , you 've got to put them <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year , we 've only have <unk> satellites from weather .
there 's a lot of a million .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin is <unk> <unk> routes .
and it 's the sense of course , of course , of course , when i look like a student like the passengers , and you laugh , and we 're not going to do an advertising , because it 's about <unk> and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the <unk> , which is so beautiful , which is so beautiful , and who 's still going to continue to go and continue to
and we were great <unk> .
so i always got to open up with the <unk> with the mistake that you think we 're <unk> .
you could still be <unk> .
we 've got a <unk> on the <unk> and we 're <unk> .
in fact , that 's not true .
we 're also making advertising .
this is a science project , the <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> did this done with the island of <unk> .
but the <unk> community is a difficult market .
and you even have to make the <unk> language : making advertising ?
we actually have enough commercials , but the internet has a lot of change that <unk> over the play , because the <unk> control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there 's just 10 to the world .
we have three .
two active , one of the <unk> , the <unk> , three , you bought it , 10 are active .
so , six of 10 .
that 's what we 're going to do is actually , if it 's actually , if it 's actually one of it .
and hope , again , again , again .
and what you see david scott , commander of the apollo 's apollo <unk> , after his <unk> paris , and five , he said , `` the walk on the <unk> .
so it 's beautiful .
now , advertising is too nice , too .
just do n't find the customers .
let 's find <unk> , we find a technological value .
there are we customers .
it 's not .
it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> .
this is how a <unk> can need to be a <unk> .
and then there is no years .
there 's also funny effect that are easy to control and be hard to control .
in each case , this is the situation , <unk> , a point in the world market , so it 's not a market .
but we continue .
it 's a icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to make it .
you just do the question : what form is we going to do ?
how much money we have in the world ?
what do we do for here ?
what kind of shape is going to do that ?
and i personally , they were asked to say something personal , i am , of course , of my flock of <unk> , where i wanted to be <unk> in the big <unk> , also the little bit of <unk> , it 's also going to save .
i was also <unk> in greenpeace three years , when i 've seen from vancouver island , and i 've seen this whole <unk> jungle , which i made me there .
and then there was a <unk> story about greenpeace that are <unk> in the money , and not knew what they should have to do , and it 's basically gone .
and there were me to do me to <unk> this .
and i 've been <unk> in three years as a <unk> , and now i 'm doing this in hope , a long future in the zeppelin .
zero , is it ? forty seconds , i 'm done , thank you .
morton bast
yes , thank you .
these are my three points that i 'd like to talk about the <unk> minutes .
why are we in the abundance of the abundance or abundance ?
how do we get to a <unk> ?
and mostly , what do n't ?
what 's what about it is ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a little bit <unk> .
but it 's also to show the challenges .
a few years ago , this is more difficult to explain .
that we have a problem today , every child .
that 's the problem .
but again , it 's already worth that again , that 's the challenges of the population growth rate .
all kinds of <unk> are exponential .
and if you see it in a historic long way , the way , the way of the body is going to be a very short episode in history .
in the moment , we ca n't imagine that it 's kind of different from the way it 's going to go on .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some of them say , well , there were early in the past , let 's look at the last <unk> years .
and you can also look at <unk> , i 'm also right .
you can also say , who needs to be <unk> ?
you can also say it 's far away .
but then there 's a little bit more part of a little bit more specifically to be real challenges in order to avoid things that are really to avoid , otherwise we just have trouble in the <unk> .
it 's called the day of time over 30 months .
and there 's degree in our cities like in vienna or in vienna , and in <unk> , and they 're always going to continue a lot .
but it 's also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas where the great streams is <unk> , and the <unk> are depending on the himalayas to the himalayas .
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is the <unk> of what we do , there was a lot larger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about the people who are actually going to be changed in a change ecosystems .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts spread out .
the bay is less .
this is the aral sea , where a fundamental part of our cotton .
and that 's all that comes from ?
all of the bad things , tell you , you know , hang in one or another form with the global <unk> .
with what we get from the entire earth , which we harvest .
not only , the oil and the minerals and minerals , but also the renewables are renewable resources , but over the end of all .
and we 're looking at just looking at so little as possible to produce less <unk> and emissions .
so , it 's about the <unk> in order to reduce the whole <unk> .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not only c , two , <unk> of a car , and really live in life .
different .
our technology is completely new .
when we look back , the soviet union , and <unk> , and there 's still on the earth are still in the ground in the ground , which is in principle , coming in a ton of resources in the year ,
in a <unk> , there was three of the human history of five tons .
today , there 's four to <unk> .
so , this is <unk> .
and he 's very , very <unk> distributed on earth .
it 's more than north america in north america is more than the earth .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa very , very much less .
and that 's where we have the implications of us , the implications of us , the rivers who has become much better in the last decades , but it 's basically the most part that we have in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world are still going to be less .
and that 's why the conflicts we see from <unk> , is , afghanistan , where they look at the most of the american <unk> survey , and then you see where the resources are coming .
and that 's where there is particularly colorful , there 's a lot of resources there , where the <unk> of the world are .
so if we want to open up with it , we have to get involved in the subject .
so we need to change the ecological boundaries everywhere , the <unk> is all over .
and that 's what we have to live in <unk> life is not so tribal .
this is the mahatma gandhi , when he said , the world has enough needs , but not for everybody greed .
and there is how we live in the average life at the average .
so .
this was the kind of <unk> part .
but i always find that you need to need to understand how to understand what it 's worth .
even if i would say , it would be worth like that , which is a way to live more .
but it 's still , but over the <unk> <unk> , you need a rationale , say , `` tell you . ''
so , what is a <unk> ?
and in fact , we have to see that we have to share in our rich parts of the world to have access to the world 's economically , meaningful physical quality of quality of life , in living in living in the average of living in the average , in the average of the average , in the average .
so here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people who are also telling people who ca n't deal with that story .
i wrote there .
<unk> climate change has the same cause .
we work too much and heavy .
this is on the one side , we come in stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i also really work very much .
and on the other hand , we 're going to get this <unk> .
what is a good life ?
how can we define that ?
now there 's a little bit of scientific science .
now , also , what i had said earlier , and what i 'm going to say is that i 'm going to say , is now a very complicated kind of complicated , but here 's the way it 's going to be in the way i think that 's the way that i think about this ?
and there is important , the quality of life has always been two things .
life quality of the objective conditions like me , what i 've got to eat .
i have a roof on the head ?
did i have friends ?
did i mean , i want to be involved in life ?
but also , how do i go to how do i get myself ?
i mean , i think that 's the perceived quality of life .
and then i 'm going to introduce two things that are important to the point .
one is needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human flourishing , of course , in order to make emotion .
if we can satisfy our needs , we are happy .
and needs you ca n't say , needs to be sustainable or unsustainable .
needs of se <unk> are not going to <unk> .
what are needs ?
you can quote from different scientists , i just have two called two .
and of course , of course , the physical needs , but also , need to have a need for social relationships .
after protection , for participation , after <unk> , after creativity , after the <unk> .
this is a little bit about money .
but in a big part , but the question is , but the question is , is i channel that in my life .
and there 's the second important statement .
strategies .
the strategy i 've got to do with me to have these needs .
and there 's a little bit about , i could like a high <unk> or a low <unk> .
there i need a lot of money or a little bit .
and strategies are my behavior like me to <unk> my needs .
that has to do with my values , with the resources that i have .
if i 'm a little bit more money , i 'm going to get some kind of going to try to satisfy my needs to satisfy when i have a lot of money in a lot of money .
it 's first to eat the <unk> , which is the roof of the head , and then the <unk> .
and there 's some of the things that can be with much or little <unk> , which can be sustainable or <unk> .
and when we have the whole strategies that i have to worry about my needs , then we talk about a lifestyle .
so .
this was the scientific <unk> .
and now , what 's now , what can we do now ?
how does it go ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
of course , this is also to find each other for themselves .
but the evidence on the individual kind of a technical way , is the idea that i have been talked about technology , and then finally , in a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
and the slides in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , in the beginning , the danger is , the danger is that we use more consumption and more resources more resources .
in the end of the quality of the quality of life , because the effects of the effects are always worse , so , and we 're going to get back to us .
or , whether we 're doing it , in a different direction , there are less than less consumption , but with a higher quality of quality of life .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe there 's a couple of things that 's <unk> in this subject , so more life quality of quality of life .
and there 's a lot of technology , how can i use every single thing that we 're using the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the <unk> , how can i make it ?
cement , i can produce different , i can build the house from wood , etc. , etc .
to create less <unk> or the same quality of life .
my other teacher , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , which is what we 've been going to have , and there 's something that has been going to be a lot of the most part of it .
where are the needs ?
what services can i do ?
and how can i do this with a little bit more precise ?
and there 's not a little bit less but <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there are many examples of the things that can be done in .
in vienna , a tower is built in two <unk> .
with seven <unk> , it 's built in <unk> .
essentially , this is from wood .
you know , if you do n't need to take a little bit more , and then they do n't need to be able to break down , and then they do n't like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of less resources , and there 's a lot of <unk> , and the goal is , with a fifth of the house , over the entire lifespan .
but it 's also a lot in our own , sort of , like , how <unk> i actually do ?
<unk> <unk> wrote a beautiful book , called <unk> .
where he shows how hard it is , in the end of this , really , from this treadmill .
the <unk> , i want to take a <unk> from the other , and then i am forever forever in this race .
you were <unk> , and you know , i 've got a little bit quickly , and then i 'll get the new .
at the nicest <unk> , i know the <unk> , you all know .
when i started my institute , a few years ago , we wrote letters .
and then you 've got to wait for the letter , i 'm going to write a letter , i 'm serious <unk> .
for that , i write hundreds of email .
and i can afford very much more .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we 're going to come back .
but i do n't really have a really time .
i did n't done a damn stranger for me .
but there 's good examples , slow food for example , for example , where i really kind of like the power of quality and the claim to the foreground .
and with a very low range of life .
one of my favorites is <unk> .
there 's 4,000 of these days , there 's a lot of average person in germany , austria about 10 things in the household .
you can begin to count .
who 's two , two , three generations had tens of thousands of thousands of thousands of things , had employees , surgery .
they have managed .
we have to deal with it .
and less people get clear with this whole options .
and we need a stick , who helps us with these two things .
now , the idea of what i 'm looking at what i 'm interesting is , perhaps , may be a kind of model of the spaceship , which i think that 's not a decade of things .
the next example is use instead of living .
a true boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> , might have been developed in alternative six years ago .
in the meantime , it 's still using more people when they think of <unk> .
when you think about <unk> .
platforms , business models that are just working with how you 've done these beautiful <unk> , which has been built in a few hundred years ago , which has been able to use a few hundred years ago , and that 's the most part of the end .
and that 's what we 've got to use better .
that 's also a question of justice .
i was showing you earlier how <unk> that is as a picture between africa and europe and a whole world .
so , like all , all the same time with these resources can only be able to use if we use very much less .
and this is not less quality of quality , because many of us has been in a lot of us .
but it 's a important task of the economy that companies , these products , these products we need to make a good life with a much less resources .
last point , that also has something to do with the great political policy , which is the growth of the growth , i think i was .
when you look at a little bit of attention to the projection , it 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , this is the <unk> coming in the bottom .
it 's called , yes , a crisis is in front of the door in front of my view , and also after what we 've spoken with economists , and there 's been a lot of economists , and there are the numbers for decades , and they 're just going to go to the bottom .
and there 's no reason to have growth again , as i know that , from my youth , from the <unk> years .
part of a mathematical reasons .
one point five percent growth today is so much like eight percent growth , over years .
and eight percent is what china has .
these are roughly where we were coming from before .
by the whole , if the pies is bigger , of course , it 's more than eight percent <unk> .
one percent is still much , so we 're going to do it .
but you have to hire a little bit like that , which is that , if we had zero growth , that 's what we had zero growth in the next year , and they consume it as a year .
we can invest good , and we can work with it .
that 's also not so backwards , because you know these statistics , which is not going to be on the growth in the quality of life .
the economy is growing , but the quality of life remains in a <unk> countries where we are .
and by the way , jobs are also possible without growth , and it 's not really not as much together , as it 's always going to be more connected , and how they 're all called the hot note .
it 's not just true , and then you have to talk to the economy of economics .
and it 's still going to get more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more , like <unk> or next week , which i think that 's a trend in the trend , a bigger story with this subject , <unk> .
already , edward <unk> , the <unk> nobel prize in his <unk> , who said the good life , the good economy of the good life .
now , this is the end of the end , and not primarily in order to create <unk> , not primarily about growth , which is not going to be in growth .
for <unk> and these countries , also for china , for india , there 's a serious story .
and that 's just as a result of the <unk> , when we 're going to grow there , and we just like this level , in this high level , which we are good at life and economies .
it 's also going to be policy .
it needs goals .
it takes a <unk> , say the economists .
it does n't need to be just like the growth , but we 're really looking at it and measure and ask , how is it in the quality of life , it 's going on ?
is the obvious thing ?
and then we have to measure our politicians .
of course , how much is the <unk> ?
how are the things together ?
we need a fundamental aspect of which is , finally , finally , and not the work .
who are you all the entrepreneurs of them , but also the workers , you know , very good .
so what 's kind of <unk> hidden , we have paid a colleague at a colleague .
you could do something different .
the resources are being used to be reduced and therefore the resources are <unk> and not the work .
and you 've got to get all the <unk> in order to ensure employment , to ensure aid , health , infrastructure .
but that 's where you have to have a little bit more hard .
so , that means , you know , you know , more or less , on all levels can work in these direction , we can work hard to the right products , services , as a consumers , what we need to do , how do we do that , how do we do something like this is
what do we need and we do n't need ?
the right policy , you choose the <unk> .
a few evidence i gave .
and then , of course , of course , the science of the science of the science of the economists are still going to boost the growth ?
but unfortunately , there 's no way .
when you look at the visible , when you look at the last 20 years , it 's always going to be down because it 's not .
the policy does n't create , and the economists are not going to be growth , but that 's the question , and that 's how do we have a good life ?
so , <unk> 's it .
be the <unk> to the <unk> .
with heart , brain , hand , and last , and last , the most part we need to need .
thank you .
i am retired <unk> .
and i love these city .
this city has to tell you so many stories .
one of them have happened a few hundred years ago .
and there 's a creative problem .
on this creative problem , i get a moment , and on the story later .
they 're going to do with the fortress .
this is serious <unk> who is in the middle of this city , and a lot of this city and also changing .
another story earlier .
it was a hot summer day in <unk> , nevada .
one man notice how to be in his shoes , right ?
it 's too warm .
he 's europeans , he did n't know the heat .
he 's making a <unk> of the shoe , and it 's not a <unk> increase in a long <unk> , and there 's several times a lot of holes there .
he <unk> the shoe again , he 's going to be <unk> , and he realizes the new climate in the shoe .
it 's the shoe , which is born .
and these number that you see here is the shoes in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> today .
a company is <unk> , with four letters .
one or another one of you know it .
he has the initial idea of nike and adidas .
both have been rejected .
so he says , good , <unk> , i do my own business .
it 's called the stock market .
there are several thousand workers in scarce business in <unk> countries in the world .
so much of a creative thing .
why not make something new , what is n't there ?
and there may be the question to be summarized by <unk> .
if you do n't know , it 's not yet familiar , it 's for what is a chance ?
and the question is that the question i 've been helped me , in tough situations .
if there was a little bit wrong , or my <unk> <unk> did n't work or work or whatever .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what is a chance ?
and it 's coming from the <unk> <unk> .
so , what the difference can do , i 'm telling you with this example .
and another example was collected by the <unk> <unk> , and that 's the <unk> statements of <unk> .
and the evidence is how creative people can be , if it comes to their own insurance .
i show you a few examples here .
so , those are actually <unk> at the <unk> <unk> and it did a commercial .
i 'm a fantastic thing .
my son has n't <unk> the woman .
he 's just <unk> , it 's the woman by the <unk> .
or i had the whole day , <unk> , when i reached the intersection , everything was raised a bush in my view , and i could n't see the other vehicle .
yeah , who 's going to blame ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 've been <unk> and two times nearly .
but you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , at the end of the <unk> , you know , you know .
the last one i was not for the crash .
it was a young woman in the <unk> .
when you 're a man , each other is obsolete .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it anyway .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i wish and i teach dreams that we all use more of this creativity .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't be that way .
why do n't things just make things better ?
old things that we 're going to do is the routine who may have been bored or <unk> , as opposite .
why not just do n't just make a little bit different , which is a little bit of simple .
and there 's so <unk> businesses that use that .
for example , <unk> , who have these <unk> from their airplane , these signs or the wall , or at the wall of the wall , for example , and then there 's something like that .
one possibility , right ?
for the coffee , rather than the coffee , rather than <unk> .
or what .
we do n't have a <unk> , <unk> .
is there tonight , right ?
if you ca n't do that cell phone .
or eating me , otherwise we both .
<unk> , but creative .
that 's what it takes .
i talk about one of the clients or the people who would be <unk> and say , okay , which looks like me .
that 's the <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and in <unk> .
once the sports , the most recent news , the policy .
when you were five times , you 're <unk> .
once they got the complaint for a long period of food .
it 's a <unk> building , and it 's very small , so the chefs had all the hands .
it was too closely .
what have been thinking about , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't get faster in the kitchen .
this idea is created .
on each table , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> salt , pepper and <unk> .
so that the people in the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for the wait for you .
simple .
a creative idea , and maybe also solved with the <unk> .
there 's a person who 's not just <unk> .
they 're the person who is the leader of the <unk> , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and there 's the german <unk> .
now , the second day , it takes a monday , so four days .
a company has taken <unk> <unk> for the employees of month , and maybe you might have , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people are going to be <unk> .
the buses are filled with a <unk> , it 's <unk> , people are organizing in carpool because of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , from other , from a <unk> .
but why do n't we have some kind of use and creative from his disadvantage ?
sometimes the creativity happens too .
and it 's coming from a <unk> , perhaps in this company , you might know .
so we did n't know that it 's not really good , but that they have to save a lot of <unk> in the <unk> .
or the <unk> in the car .
there 's the different , <unk> , and all kinds of directions .
yes .
why not be a piece of <unk> in the car , when you 're <unk> ?
or in <unk> , there 's also opportunities to make a creative .
and all that has just to do with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
my <unk> son was in the office .
and she 's sitting on this <unk> .
so , we have several <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he turns out of the left , he 's joy , and i 'm telling me in my secret <unk> , '' you know , `` yes , it 's no playground here .
he to me , look at me , big eyes , playground , playground .
and in the moment i 'm actually , right ?
why is n't a playground ?
why is what we do , not the playground for adults ?
well , a lot of things , right ?
when we 're lazy if we use our talents , what we do .
and there are <unk> , but it 's relaxed .
the <unk> is that when a particular day of the week is changing in our brains .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow our focus on a day .
that 's how another day , we would rather be a lot .
so in the weekend .
you hear it in the media .
<unk> is , yeah , a day to weekend .
or if you announced the most beautiful time of the year , the vacation .
what are the rest of the <unk> weeks of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
have we all so terrible jobs ?
one <unk> had stopped , this is the subject .
yes , monday , i am i and the rest of life , please .
or on <unk> , facebook , all over the social networks are taken this subject .
i once <unk> in the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i 'd like to look at the way .
what have these in the <unk> , what are there ?
and one day , i <unk> this business with this person to buy this .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , that 's pretty nice .
so , from so , from that love to work .
i <unk> that , i 'm a father of five kids , but i also love my work .
yes .
or even <unk> for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
why the own attitude , which is shown there , and it 's still going to continue .
someone who has a answer to this direction , it 's not the monday , it 's your jobs .
and i actually actually ask with the pink <unk> , and say , okay , all the way .
what about my job is beautiful ?
stupid is , even if it 's the pink glasses , it looks like before .
so something beautiful , that 's not nice , does n't work .
the pink pair of <unk> are <unk> .
there 's what you 're going to fly in a wonderful thing , which is going to end in the eye .
but they do n't <unk> .
where is that if we do n't change that ?
in fact , the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside as a <unk> .
it might end up in a system where we feel like that as we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes up in this wheel and running and running and running , and at some point , it 's going to be fast , this wheel , the poor mouse and you get out .
what is the mouse ?
they do n't know anything else , it 's in the <unk> .
and again , and again , and again , maybe the movie is <unk> the <unk> , you might be able to get soft .
this is nice <unk> here with hay , so you do n't have a mess there , and it 's always going to go and over again .
and that 's what we 're going to have a funny , probably the mouse thought , yes ?
or something is that <unk> <unk> .
i was like a lot of years ago from a seminar home .
and in a time , the road turned on me , i felt pretty black in my eyes , and somehow i 've got to stay .
the next day , i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there ?
he was looking at me and he said , no way , is physically in order .
but what 's the <unk> ?
and i looked at my calendar to check this , and saw three weeks , and i was also working on the job .
and after six years , in the <unk> and participants who can do first in early in the night in the afternoon earlier .
i have thought , what are there in jobs ?
and we started making <unk> , again , to look at other priorities , to look at my family with my family , something good for me .
and in fact , whether it 's not a serious <unk> .
i realized that the talks about the talks about large groups , who are really happy .
i 'm going to go like l.a. and <unk> and other things , but these talks to be allowed to be able to share with experiences , are really happy .
and that was n't it .
i 've got to see that this <unk> are ill .
and sometimes it 's right , so it 's going to be a piece of the boat , <unk> of me from the hospital , after he had a heart attack , and then he starts to say , <unk> .
in the past , when i said , you 're still going to go , yeah , you know , you know , you know , you know , you go with your running and so .
today , it 's true .
so , with <unk> , beautiful , slowly , in the right <unk> , but then we 'll also go together in common .
what happens ?
in the bottom , we 're all healthier .
the <unk> walk down , but one curve that 's going on , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> four percent of four percent of the last 10 years , <unk> percent , almost minus percent , that 's beautiful , that 's less .
rise to the mental diseases plus <unk> percent .
this is something where i think is that ?
why is that ?
is that just in austria ?
no , also in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , it 's going to be healthier .
that 's how you see here in the left .
in the bottom of the lower diseases , plus a half percent within the last 10 years , a big german <unk> .
the number of <unk> <unk> takes .
the cost .
and it 's looking at all kinds of official , what can we do with this topic ?
and so , i think , are also a little bit more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be like this .
so , it 's good .
and somebody once said , no alcohol is no answer .
but what is the solution ?
what is what we do again , and it 's going to be a good thing ?
and that 's the last years .
now , i 've got to have something like <unk> , can it be so much ?
i 'm a <unk> who is n't the job that 's not what it 's going to be <unk> and happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , belief and so on .
but in fact , we have the largest part of our <unk> in the work .
and if we do that , why does n't do that , it 's not going to do it as well , and then it 's also a delight .
the <unk> <unk> , i 'm telling you as well as well as a result , to the <unk> .
so these little <unk> , you hope to make it easier .
<unk> is for talent and freedom and environment .
that means how do i mean my talents ?
what are i doing that in which , i do that with who ?
what the freedom i have to do , what do i want to do ?
because , is the level of the <unk> , which is <unk> .
the more it , the more stress .
and what do i do ?
it 's the muscle .
that 's the four parts .
and it can see each other for themselves .
i had to look at this for me for me , and i 'm always going to keep it all the time .
can i use my talents ?
in what the environment ?
and that means , sometimes i go into a cafe with my laptop to prepare for the seminar or a <unk> .
the freedom .
what freedom can i take to do what is important .
and do i do it ?
it 's the muscle .
the last u .
and then there 's people who tell me why this is not .
and why is a lot more difficult .
and i 'd like to have a answer to this point .
who wants to find ways .
who is not , there 's reasons .
and by the case , by the point , you can choose to choose , `` i think , '' i need to make ways , or i have some reasons ?
and they 're going to be in two .
so what do we do with our talents ?
each of you have his big <unk> <unk> .
it 's much too small .
it 's filled with <unk> , with gold , everything , with their capabilities .
what do we do that ?
by the end of the <unk> , we ask ourselves .
or if we 're in the hospital or at the end of a life .
what did i do with my talents ?
and by the way , who 's looking at <unk> <unk> , i 'd like to access to there .
so what do we do with our talents , so my first question , also in me , and that 's every day .
i mean , `` well , i mean , good enough ?
and resources .
there was something that was a story .
i wanted to tell you about <unk> .
and i 'm going to do that one .
these fortress was saving saved for the <unk> years ago as a result of the <unk> .
and the enemy realized that the fortress was so good that you could n't take them .
black walls , <unk> ways , <unk> <unk> to the fortress , thick doors , <unk> <unk> .
was <unk> in the time .
so the thing , the thing , okay , okay , if we do n't come up , we create a <unk> .
we do n't get out there anymore , and it 's pure .
so , let 's look at how long , the long time .
the <unk> thought it was made of long until the day of the day was used .
they 've only had a <unk> of the way to get caught <unk> as the <unk> to the sun , to give me this <unk> and give me three days .
this is okay , <unk> , you 've got it , i <unk> you , come up , take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> go with the <unk> path .
in a time , the enemies are <unk> at the wall of the hills , and over the left to right , and already in the left .
good , think , a <unk> , what is that .
it 's day .
again , a <unk> <unk> , at the top of the fortress , this time , it 's black .
enemies are thinking , oh , who has two <unk> , it might take a little bit .
the same scenario , the time , again , it 's the time he knows the <unk> .
at the end of the second day , after six different <unk> ends , they were in a <unk> .
because they thought it takes us to a long time that we do n't think more .
afterwards , the <unk> went down to the <unk> and <unk> .
one thing they had and have the <unk> .
and this is the <unk> <unk> .
i like this idea that everything we need , and that we have everything .
sometimes it 's high resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but also , again , we can do something .
we have no idea of power that we have to invent the world .
and if you believe this could be a good <unk> , then you 're right .
in the spring , the spring rolls .
come .
and we in <unk> know , there 's the snow <unk> there , it 's going to catch the plants from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there are blooms of these blooms of these blooms of the fruit .
there 's a little bit of <unk> here we then harvest and eat .
there 's the grain of this grain , we can get into it and provide bread .
there are any animals that eat .
there 's people who then eat products later later .
and it 's being automatic .
but if you think about it 's not thinking about that , maybe that 's not as automatically it will be a fear and empowered .
and of course , this threat may just be quite abstract , but in the area of blooms , the connection of the plant are not very , very , very large .
there are the research that show up to <unk> percent of our food , in particular food is not there if we had no bees .
also , also , it sounds like this as <unk> because it 's normal for us , and we may not perceive it as well .
there was a very interesting movie now , <unk> , <unk> .
and i recommend you , look at it .
but now , let 's look at the lord `` the lord '' of the lord of the <unk> , which is not in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> .
and that 's what he does with a school at <unk> and he 's going to tell us a little bit about his work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
only one big thank you a big thank you to mr. <unk> and on the whole <unk> .
that i 'm doing with my project , <unk> , <unk> , to provide something about the life of bees .
and also , under a wing of a wing , to tell you something about little <unk> .
now , i 'm going to suppose that the most people of them are now , it would be a <unk> company in <unk> minutes in the basics of beekeeping .
i do n't do that , no .
but maybe it might be able to do it to love these <unk> , or a certain empathy of them to develop , and they 're going to engage them to the <unk> of this <unk> , <unk> astronomy .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm a gorgeous woman , married , a wonderful woman , father from five children , and <unk> <unk> and work in <unk> and adults .
i 'm a member of the <unk> in the <unk> , and in the hunger , <unk> <unk> .
and now work in the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> with our <unk> students in <unk> .
we work there in the backyard , in agriculture and beekeeping .
<unk> is actually a play of <unk> <unk> and is <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is more a <unk> , a quiet , a quiet thing .
and she also leads to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not for free , the old greeks have known to the context of honey <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he 's like the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to inspire him , that he can be dense .
but the <unk> are not going to go in itself , but they send their blue bees and <unk> the poets in the mouth , and again , the words later that honey from the <unk> .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully it 's going to happen to me tonight .
yes .
flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of these <unk> , this <unk> , my students are built my students together in 30 to <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools in <unk> , in college or in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , or in the <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> or in classrooms in <unk> .
the teacher who is accompanied this project with me in the class and we 're looking at a piece of place for a <unk> place .
the window at the same time , the kids can see something like this month .
and all of all things , so the bees , the bees who then are inside the hose and again .
and then there 's the window of a room .
so .
and then the whole thing begins with me .
so i 'm going to take a <unk> and <unk> , now i 'm going to see two <unk> in these <unk> .
so , crucial to this <unk> , so they are <unk> bees .
also , we also have <unk> <unk> , and here has to be fresh <unk> , so fresh eggs .
and then a <unk> , there 's top .
there 's honey .
they need bad weather , and you ca n't fly .
so .
this looks like this .
and then , the <unk> here goes up here , and immediately , the transportation begins with the transportation of the transportation of the transportation , or in the school in school .
and now , something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees are there in the class of the time , all the crisis .
their people are not more .
they are lonely .
they do n't find your queen .
and this is the most important task of the <unk> , when he does this <unk> , that he stays in the old people .
so that is not on this two <unk> .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they begin to <unk> .
yeah , the <unk> says she <unk> .
you hear that .
they 're almost more likely to be higher than when they 're normally <unk> in your <unk> with a queen .
and now , a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , now , in a night now , they 're going to provide the need to be a new people , and the whole thing happens to be done without <unk> , without conferences , without talking , without the religious and positions .
so here 's the people agree and then it 's a <unk> in the first night .
because without the queen , this people would n't exist more .
because <unk> lives only six weeks .
so .
and in this first night , they get out of one of these <unk> <unk> , and they get an egg in these <unk> .
and there 's a <unk> .
everyone who had <unk> in high school in high school , say how to do it ?
yes , genetically <unk> is all genetically <unk> .
that 's true .
and now , something wonderful .
now , this <unk> here is going to become a <unk> in the <unk> one .
the <unk> has the first three days the same genetic code like the <unk> code .
it 's going to be fed up with a <unk> .
you know this term .
and immediately , on this <unk> , the genetic code .
the <unk> are being transformed by the <unk> in the <unk> .
we 've heard that before , what we eat is what 's going to be out of us .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
so three days three days , five days <unk> .
and this is the students all <unk> .
you see in the class .
and then that cell is <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and the whole thing happened , because the people now is <unk> , or because one of the <unk> says , or you do n't have a <unk> of a group .
no , this is happening .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or an <unk> decision .
and then , students are waiting for eight days , my students know , three five eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight five eight eight eight eight , days that these queen <unk> .
and so in the day , so that 's the teachers who has <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> in the students in the students , yes .
and then the mother , tell what 's going on here ?
yeah , i have to school .
yeah , why ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then the morning to have six in school .
and then the <unk> <unk> on this <unk> , because they want to <unk> the queen now .
and if you see the real person , you know , it 's first .
these queen <unk> .
so .
another higher .
and then the <unk> and <unk> , the queen .
the first thing that these the queen is , they spread their wing , and there 's all the <unk> of these people who have a queen , her <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> .
the people have a identity .
now three to five days for five to five days .
you see the <unk> in front of your <unk> <unk> .
at the back , the bat comes out of the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days , this queen goes out of the <unk> .
now , some thinking , yeah , i 've seen a <unk> in the <unk> .
wait , <unk> .
which is completely different .
so , let 's go .
this is the queen the <unk> flies now with no <unk> , without <unk> , from that <unk> , from two miles .
you 've never seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> and there 's a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , from seven to 12 drones , male bees .
so , vice versa , like islam , where the man has got to have the queen , the queen who has seven to 12 men .
and all in a wonderful way in the flight .
the drone is from the back of the back of these queen , and this queen takes all the time in this <unk> <unk> , which they need to put in seeds for three years .
for the drone , it 's an amazing experience .
when you get finished with the <unk> , she 's dead and it falls dead .
and then the queen comes back and starts to put eggs .
there 's always a , two students in the class that can see immediately .
you see the queen 's queen .
yes .
and then it ends up the project in school because now the <unk> and the queen is going to be in the queen and the queen and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
and then i 'm going to come from one night before .
`` the <unk> of the outside , and on the next morning , i 'm betting the queen with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there you see the queen .
yes .
<unk> <unk> .
and it 's mostly 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then this is , this two <unk> are coming here in a <unk> .
in a <unk> stick in a prey , and now this people can be big and powerful .
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the children who have the experienced is never forget .
yes .
there 's not just that , in this class , the students who are all the time with the bees , but the whole school comes in this class .
and the teachers when he knows something , if he can be prepared to be prepared to join a period of the other .
now , look , bees and serious <unk> , we 've got a cave paintings , where people did n't have the honey to honey .
a few months ago , a few months ago , a few months ago , in israel , the <unk> of the people were found the bees in the time .
all human culture has grown with honeybees .
or vice versa , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india , in egypt , in greece in greece in rome in rome .
they were all over .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are over .
he can be a <unk> , a <unk> join , he can join a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , you know what flowers or trees are <unk> , what you need ?
that you find out there in the summer in agriculture .
this is out there , this is a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can go through the students in the <unk> , and there 's some flowers in the <unk> , you know , the <unk> of bees , and look at how long we need to go from the <unk> to my flowers ?
how long are you in the individuals ?
and how long , you need to come back .
he can make a <unk> <unk> .
how do i <unk> a <unk> ?
yes .
you know , if this is that this is the top of the top of the top , it 's a <unk> thing , right ?
look at all .
he can be a math -- a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can see the students in the students at the <unk> .
and then he 's going to go to the question , how did <unk> <unk> the nobel prize ?
because it took that the bees are seeing in the beehive .
but ladies and gentlemen , it 's <unk> .
there 's not a bee .
and just the professor of the professor who taught many years in university has taught in university , in <unk> , the bees found out there to be a <unk> .
like a <unk> net from the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and now with <unk> hertz , the <unk> <unk> , and the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the bees , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , with her <unk> .
see what these bees are doing in school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they lose their fear of fear .
and develop a awareness for the bees .
they learn <unk> , that 's what the bees do .
and they get a warning of these creatures , which is basically lives for us .
the bees are not even <unk> a kilo of a half a person in the year .
<unk> years ago , the only way to create <unk> .
they 're collecting the <unk> in the trees .
this is a <unk> , with the <unk> of them .
and now , imagine the summer , these are <unk> , <unk> bees on such a narrow space , in <unk> level .
hey , there 's <unk> without end .
no , in the bees do n't .
because they have natural population of antibiotics .
you collect pollen , and it 's making it <unk> , it becomes <unk> , a vibrant <unk> .
someone who are in the <unk> is , 72 <unk> , <unk> who can go to a <unk> and provide a <unk> to the people from the people .
of course , there 's a grid , and with <unk> with a <unk> , and so on , because nothing happens .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , the auction of the <unk> , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , and we would have less apples , and we would have less apple , if the bees would n't fly , or we would have to be able to fly like the chinese , and they would have to be able to be able to the chinese .
there 's a lot more connections .
look at the <unk> , there 's the north pole , where the cows graze .
and there 's the bee goes down , you get your nectar and <unk> .
and now the cow is coming , and it 's <unk> the <unk> , and , because it 's <unk> <unk> , you can digest .
yeah ?
and then she <unk> it , and then , ah , i got <unk> <unk> , ah , i can <unk> it .
and then there 's milk .
this is the bee .
yeah ?
and in the end of the end of the paintings , the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of what we have on nature .
the honey .
i 'll just want to go to the point , <unk> .
my students are looking at each year when they build these <unk> and then partly me to go together in the schools .
now , that 's not my <unk> , but once i had a student , and i told you in college school , and i said , `` well , you know , <unk> <unk> , ''
and then he says , yeah , i grew up <unk> .
i come from <unk> in <unk> and i am six years .
and i 've been in <unk> for five years , and in two years in the <unk> .
and i 'm glad i 'm not going to learn that i need to learn from the <unk> and learn with the hands .
<unk> , yeah .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> college , <unk> college .
and more than half , she said , oh , we want to .
my students are a huge appreciation of a huge appreciation and the parts between , in <unk> , regular and the <unk> people being pulled through the bees .
she 's <unk> , and they get self-esteem , my students and a pride of pride .
how do you get the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you need to say , how do you get to the <unk> ?
and there 's what i think , there 's the person who is , the person who is <unk> , and there 's a new <unk> .
and he says , `` so , start .
a little poem from <unk> <unk> .
who 's like the bee would be the bee by the <unk> , and you never get the path to the <unk> , and they never lose the direction of the <unk> in <unk> <unk> , as soon he would n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love of all friends in the world .
welcome to my project .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of the female <unk> .
in my eyes , the biggest crimes of humanity , because it 's been <unk> for <unk> years .
the society against women with the women 's <unk> sacrifice a day .
first i 'm looking at .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
i 've done a <unk> years .
you can think that 's not the job of the job .
i did n't feel <unk> .
and that 's why i was glad i could <unk> me in the subject of the subject , and i could <unk> it .
for example , this .
with a massive <unk> , over the atlantic from africa from brazil .
on the end of the <unk> , the <unk> genocide in the past genocide in the last <unk> indians stop the <unk> .
this was a journey where i was more <unk> than <unk> , more than <unk> .
but nevertheless , these are attracted to find the interest of media and even a little person like i could make his cause of the world .
now , i 've got a little <unk> in ethiopia .
there was war between the <unk> and ethiopia , and we 've got <unk> of this killings .
and despite all cruelty , which is the infinite side of the other , the infinite hospitality of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , arab hospitality .
and twice it happened when we were invaded invaded and our two <unk> , which you see here in front of us , and the <unk> <unk> in front of us , and they said that 's my people .
if you have to kill you , you have to shoot by us .
something like i 've found in no other culture .
and then in young years , they 've learned that you ca n't reduce islam in terrorism .
and christians do n't want to be reduced to their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather than the true values like someone , social accountability .
these are the values to fight it .
i 've been a lot of years , i 've been in this <unk> , with my wife .
and then we were listening to this <unk> female <unk> .
when i heard that <unk> percent of the daily victims , the rest are christians and <unk> , i thought how it can be a <unk> like islam , besides what islam is next to all the shoes ?
and the idea was born the highest shifts of islam to explain to the sin .
we were looking at <unk> with german organizations that have not found .
now , we would be listening to it , we 'd be very <unk> , which islam is not <unk> .
you would be <unk> my neck .
in <unk> international international , we started designing our own organization .
and they were independent and <unk> .
and in order to have this struggle , we needed images .
it was a lack of it .
and that 's why , and i moved back in this desert to make these images of these images .
the bad bloody images , i do n't show you , but i want to get the crimes of this crimes .
girl in the age of four weeks , eventually , at the end of my parents , at the end of their parents and relatives , on the <unk> , on the limbs , you put on the limbs , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> instruments without the <unk> instruments without <unk> instruments without the <unk> instruments without <unk> and anatomy .
what 's going to get a room from the size of a <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> .
when you get your rule , they cheat two weeks .
being unimaginable , in the body and soul , their dignity were expanding .
this was the beginning of called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> , it 's on .
the man has to open up .
he never seen one <unk> woman .
the <unk> said he said , `` well , <unk> , is not a problem .
you <unk> your penis with <unk> , and then you poke hard .
and if you do n't do it , not bad .
and you take the knife and <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> .
one third of the girl .
this was 10 months ago .
<unk> was lost his language .
these are the <unk> , also some in asia .
most of these are <unk> .
and when we find muslims , why did you do that ?
was the <unk> answer , which is we have to do this in the koran .
nothing is in the koran , totally the opposite .
everyone <unk> five times in the prayer , like singular <unk> , who is , who is , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe what you pray there .
they 're <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of women are made wrong , and why you could be as a <unk> person who could be <unk> , for women , women .
but now we 've got the images of the first pair of these <unk> .
he <unk> us his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there was hard discussions , two days .
but we had the minister of the minister on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then , the great decision , the soft is against all of all human rights , against religion , we have to ban him .
the last one was <unk> this new <unk> .
and when you have africa , and the <unk> knows , you know , you know , it 's done for these people .
and it became celebration and these successes we had in other countries .
so short example , <unk> of the highest spiritual , which is his message from the country , the <unk> of the message , the <unk> of the message , the <unk> of the message , is that it 's a crime , to write the <unk> .
for weeks , we were the road , with their <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had .
and where we got , we have just open ears , open arms and the historical , holy hospitality .
and when we wanted to leave the country at the end of the country , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to do all of all countries ?
so much of them is not going to give you a little bit more .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> , and you have to get to get slowly .
and in fact , he had an idea .
he said , if it 's going to do it , the 10 <unk> muslims in the world , and explain the needs to the sin , it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo in the <unk> and on the <unk> .
and in the <unk> for <unk> , the <unk> , his <unk> , <unk> ali , we got a <unk> .
he heard the idea of it was excited about it , especially , when we do it , that we could finance this .
and that 's what we 're doing about <unk> that are supporting us .
and then he said , i 'm not just reading the conference , so how we had asked him , but i 'll take the <unk> .
and he did .
over cairo <unk> in the years , our transparent .
international <unk> to <unk> the female body of <unk> .
under the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ali <unk> <unk> .
and everybody 's got .
hundred <unk> , but the highest of the world .
in the middle of the <unk> islands , the man has <unk> in hamburg and the rest of europe is the largest growth of the <unk> of cartoons .
so men and death can decide .
but just the others .
on the left of the left <unk> , on the right , my <unk> .
the highest of the world .
and over which i 'm going to <unk> me and <unk> .
and then i took all the <unk> .
it started the conference .
and under our frill on the left of links from egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> egypt , <unk> mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much to the subject , islam is not <unk> .
we had medical school students in their way , which is a terrible thing , which is a terrible thing to do , with the <unk> .
and then they had to show her film , <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they moved back behind <unk> doors to two hours , and she wrote a <unk> .
the <unk> in front of the cameras , announced what you 've chosen .
and the most important phrase , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime in the highest values of islam .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought that was done , but the bill had done without our <unk> .
because the shame , about the abdomen of the woman is stronger than anybody understood .
that 's why we were doing .
we 've got this conference in this called golden book .
one <unk> for the <unk> of the world .
and because <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , it was so good , it 's a <unk> .
it will take us from the hands .
we were in many countries had to conferences with the top of the highest <unk> .
and she was reading the interest in the interest , so it was so excited about it .
but , unfortunately , most of the courage to come up to a <unk> .
in the <unk> of the woman , you ca n't talk in the mosque .
just a couple of have the courage .
they were in the universities , on <unk> .
and sometimes we 've found some bold <unk> in the mosque , which is what you 've got in the mosque like this .
and then there 's all over speakers in the <unk> .
and these are the subjects .
they 're going to spread .
but i 'm going to have time .
it 's all <unk> on hot stones , and that 's why i work on many other strategies , this subject .
<unk> <unk> .
but my <unk> that would be this .
i want to announce the great message of the world in the <unk> of islam , which is the kaaba in mecca .
not as <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
when there 's four million people come together , men and women are the islamic currents .
and then i <unk> with all of the <unk> and the <unk> king of my transparent with the <unk> <unk> .
as i 've been trained in the <unk> .
unfortunately , the last <unk> , that would be king .
but i 'm sure when he would be <unk> .
for one to help these women .
for other , to show the world , which is the true values of islam , rather than just <unk> .
the terrorists as a <unk> .
and if i do n't do that , then , maybe i may not have this thing , i might have this idea of what in hamburg , in hamburg .
you know , at least many <unk> in the mosques in all the world .
and we could get our transparent there .
and maybe i may still have to be that little girl has to have his daughters more <unk> .
and then my life has been the equivalent of it .
and i want to say , i want to say , you want to have to have this one now , and you 've got to have to join me .
it 's not going to come from a <unk> .
we need to get a practice in the ton , and there 's a nest entrance from this stage .
and now i want to show you the design of my <unk> .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and this is in all the <unk> in the top of the name of the name of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> that 's got to play .
there we have it in german .
female <unk> is incompatible with the koran and the ethics of islam .
she 's <unk> and a discrimination of the islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i start .
this is how the <unk> looked like that you grew up in germany .
at the <unk> , my mother , my brother , my brother , and i to <unk> a package of this package .
<unk> <unk> .
my mom was completely horrified , because they did n't know why it 's been <unk> .
the third day we 've been trained .
and we were able to get the trash , and then it was going to throw it back to a <unk> woman , and they were just <unk> in <unk> .
she tried to explain what you could do .
that 's not <unk> .
it actually tastes very good .
it 's cheese .
my mom moved to the eyebrow , and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own country , we would have noticed that , but it does n't smell so much .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
fifteen years ago , i am my mom and my brother from china to china .
from this <unk> , i 'm telling you today .
but mostly , it 's all about the people who allowed these <unk> and have done a success story .
but first , i first tell you where i am on .
i am retired .
<unk> are a little <unk> that live in the northwest of china .
and this region is called the chinese .
it 's about <unk> miles away from germany .
china is in china , 10 million <unk> , but in <unk> , the largest <unk> community outside china .
and that <unk> life , so because we have to have to be suffering from in china .
hundreds of china became extra to <unk> relocated to our own home .
our own language , our own language , <unk> became <unk> .
in schools and in universities , it 's only taught for chinese .
and our religion can not confuse it .
the <unk> are losing their culture and identity .
and if somebody 's courageous , and for the rights of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or even death or even death .
and that was also the reason why my parents decided to escape with our kids .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this is a little bit about our escape .
we did n't had enough money , so that 's why my father had to be behind it .
i 'm involved in a lot of people who helped us in the escape .
i 'm betting in a lot of images .
but i 'm looking at all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> it in front of me when i <unk> my eyes .
he was big with <unk> , and we met it , and we met him with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first rate was to be <unk> .
i know many of a bad picture of <unk> <unk> did n't want to do their deals with <unk> .
but i 'm <unk> , i call it <unk> , not as a <unk> .
because <unk> gave us months .
he stood at the airport in <unk> in <unk> in a <unk> , and he was able to go to the last conclusion , whether it was really safe by the <unk> .
airport in <unk> , we came up , and i know how my mother somehow told me from the airport .
do n't tell you .
until we 're outside .
because i was in my hand , and there was my photograph in my hand , but there was an alien name , <unk> .
i had to have a <unk> .
and i 'm <unk> in <unk> <unk> , who had my passport in the hand .
silence .
sweat .
a long look .
we were finally <unk> .
in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , i was involved in a lot of <unk> who had somehow been very supported very much .
i <unk> myself to the <unk> woman who have used to be used in the <unk> .
in a <unk> , four <unk> per <unk> of 13 families .
at least , kids are .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was foreign faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother , and i had to share a <unk> .
there was eaten , and they did , and homework .
friends were not to visit because i was <unk> where we were .
just my <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> were known .
she had my story , and they knew very , and they were <unk> me .
for example , for example , she brought me to me <unk> what i do n't do .
but they do n't work to meet german <unk> <unk> .
i spent my whole story in the <unk> .
it was not just for my mother .
with each other alone , with our man , and still in the uncertainty of the uncertainty , because we had a <unk> , and could n't get a <unk> and could n't be a <unk> .
i 'm betting that i was very , very , very aggressive .
it 's also a little bit of embarrassing , which is now going to tell you , but now i have to be just to my story .
i was very aggressive , and i could be very bad at school .
and the <unk> had been a <unk> , where we 've got to the first time we got to be a little bit of normal kids .
i mean , i 'd like to be normal , i had to live in a <unk> .
i also <unk> myself to the <unk> and <unk> my brother or <unk> .
it 's just a little bit .
i also <unk> myself in several <unk> to us with homework , because our parents could n't have german .
or they 're just looking at <unk> .
we are always very happy .
i know how we were looking at the fence of the fence and wait until these people , because , somehow <unk> people had for us , and that was important to us .
after two years , my father finally came to germany .
but the problem was that he was going to be a little bit of <unk> , because it did n't find a place in <unk> .
i 'm looking at the very , very , very <unk> , the father of my father ago , to preserve it in order to preserve it in <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm betting on this time where i really have very , very happy , because after six years , we had to draw a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we finally had a own apartment with a personal and a personal kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was very small , and i had no desk inside , but it was good , i could close my door .
and i <unk> myself , i 've got the time , very good , but i had to leave the <unk> with a degree .
i really have a perspective on me .
and there was a <unk> , which has been connecting me in the <unk> , and it still does n't do it on the idea that i can get over the second <unk> .
first , the <unk> .
thank you the teachers who really believed me , and i was really not just too easy to the time i even made it to the middle .
afterwards , i came to the <unk> .
and before i was playing with the <unk> , i was playing with my best friend <unk> .
<unk> is a organization or a project of organized organized .
but i was no good <unk> that i 've been doing that because we had a place where we could just go to <unk> .
we had a <unk> , which we had our <unk> <unk> .
and the ladder of <unk> helped records us that we could tell our problems , and he was public , and we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
and then i came to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people without having a conclusion , who are going to get out of language .
so that really made me very well , and i realized that art is something like me .
by <unk> and the encounter , a filmmaker came to us .
he made the film <unk> over my friends and me .
and the movie won great prices .
we realized that people were interested in our story .
he was a very special feeling because we 've never experienced that people had heard us .
and that was a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to <unk> anymore .
i want to make something from my life .
a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , to me to join me to a <unk> of the <unk> .
but there i had a little bit in the <unk> building me , i ended up with a <unk> for a piece and the title of four .
so i was right .
i played .
and the great thing is that after a performance of two editors ' <unk> <unk> on me .
and i had wondered , if i would have been interested in the way i had a little bit more comfortable .
i thought , great , <unk> .
let me go .
and i made a little bit for the <unk> <unk> , now , a pulse of pulse , and one of my parts over a piece of a play , where i was placed in the european <unk> .
and i 've actually won him .
now , i study in college and film <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i 'm <unk> in the third year .
and that would n't be done for me , if not we could n't have a single or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> or projects like <unk> , for me , for me .
you 've got out of me , and you 've opened me together , you 've shown me ways , how i 'm my seat in society .
and i 'm going to get you to you now .
each of you have the possibility of people who have to help me get people like me to get a second chance and find your life or their place in society .
because the people , every single hundred refugees come from refugees , and every one of them are filled with hope , and everyone has a big potential .
you 've got there with a lot of determination to make a lot of terrible hurdles .
and with this determination , they could be a lot of profit for germany and for each one of us .
and i could actually tell you a thousand things , which you can do , but i do n't have enough time , even though there 's a minute , i brought a <unk> .
now , you get your cell phone out , you ca n't tell me that you ca n't have a code .
scan the code , and then you come on the side of <unk> with a lot of incentives , which they can do .
and that would be very helpful .
i 'm now looking at the time now , and we 'll see ourselves outside .
and they scan the code .
i <unk> it .
a lot of you did n't have the cell phone in the hand .
are you so happy , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> .
now , just a <unk> <unk> .
okay , i 'm happy that we have .
my name is robin .
my favorite thing is , you write .
i 'm coming from austria , in vienna .
i 'm glad i 'm too much , so i 'm not allowed to be in <unk> .
i 'm a lot of it every time .
and that 's no phrase that 's a feeling .
yes , yeah , in contrast to the other <unk> , i 'm not here today to <unk> you about anything .
i did n't know what .
it 's so , it 's why i write the text in my spare time , and then these are talking about it , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
yeah , and i became asked to talk a few texts , to read the whole program a little bit .
and that 's what i 'm going to do here tonight .
yes .
i start with a joke .
meet two chickens .
so the one thing is , is two english chickens i 'm <unk> , so i do n't get <unk> , but i 'm not going to be a funny thing in <unk> , and i 'm going to be <unk> in <unk> .
tell the other thing .
hey , there 's no <unk> me .
this is what we 've done in the level .
the first text is a little <unk> that i wrote .
i got a person to one person who 's partly what means .
it 's wearing the title .
and she did n't understand it .
when your head in my lap , your rest was under my ceiling .
my leg was also under my lower leg outside the ceiling .
my leg was in the ceiling .
it 's about your own head , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the rest of my lap , the rest of your ceiling , my leg , my leg also under the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling .
and that has been <unk> , when my leg was extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the next text , i also got to a person who is very much .
and my grandpa .
we have no contact at all .
my <unk> grandfather was <unk> .
now , as a kid , he 's <unk> .
all right , yeah .
yes , <unk> text .
better .
jesus is the only <unk> is on the <unk> of the bus .
but where was he when he was going to save me to save the <unk> ?
have to think , yes ?
did i have my <unk> ?
next text .
the next text is a little bit more .
it actually takes a second .
so to write .
marcus : read faster .
this is the beginning of a novel i write in the <unk> .
ah , it 's about <unk> guy , so the adventure from a guy who keeps the hair and a little bit of <unk> .
but i 'm always chasing myself in this point of the <unk> .
because i 'm never telling me the hairs .
chapter one .
if i get <unk> , my head is empty .
so empty as the slate , it 's trying to fill it .
yeah , i 'm not one .
very hard a year .
the next text is also a little bit of <unk> .
most people do n't understand it .
i do n't stop myself .
and that 's the thing that i 'm going to play with my vocabulary and with my language .
i always liked to play with me .
and yes , then you get out .
it 's wearing the title .
is a little bit of funny .
probably the <unk> <unk> that i 've ever wrote .
<unk> , we can .
yes , we <unk> .
we can .
we <unk> .
i 'm not going to ca n't here .
but i can .
i do n't know .
i do n't do it .
yes , i did n't understand .
no idea .
yeah , yeah , <unk> <unk> .
i always tell you , either or no one .
the next page has also to do what to do with text .
it 's kind of a little <unk> .
i wrote that in insects .
very polite .
yes , <unk> text .
is a little turret .
and this is something that 's been cool when i do so that they might say that you might say three .
my text wearing the title , all good things are cool .
so , in the way , there 's <unk> dry .
we have <unk> <unk> .
so , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and scratch , and then it 's going to be better and yes , it was .
beautiful moment .
yes , <unk> <unk> , this is another one .
and this is something that 's cool when i could make all this kind of <unk> , so that 's all the way we put it all .
exactly , so what the wind is going to do .
the text is wearing the title , and it 's like .
yes .
power is for you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write a little bit like this .
this is a <unk> <unk> slide .
<unk> is called <unk> s .
s s ?
yes , yeah .
power is for you .
yes , <unk> sentence .
it 's written in <unk> .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's a little bit impossible to explain , which is the point .
here 's another text .
this day is a <unk> .
it 's the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he had known it before i 've done it as a <unk> .
he was <unk> me , then he would give me <unk> .
i could go later in him later .
i made him the delight .
it was made as a <unk> in all other days and put me back to me .
with a <unk> <unk> , where else else ?
and the intent is not to give it more to write <unk> .
and if i was going to wake up later , it can not be a <unk> day .
is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what is albert einstein , when his steak did n't taste ?
i <unk> .
so .
<unk> sound sounds like the cow .
this is funny .
yeah , the next text has also learned the paper .
it 's rather than political .
so , i do n't write some funny things .
i also write a very political problem .
and that 's what i 'm going to talk about is how i 'm going to ask , where i 'm <unk> .
and , yeah , i 've got this text here .
he 's wearing the title .
my father came from vienna , then in my mother , and i from her .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yeah , i 'd like to make a little bit of advertising .
i ca n't do business or something like that , so i have to make this .
and in fact , i 'm also looking at some eye , and i also do a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
let 's like to come .
and yes , i 'm <unk> , i 'm actually really <unk> .
and , yes .
i 'm just like to say .
it 's on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little commercials i wrote .

so the <unk> .
<unk> .
there 's a funny thing .
i want to write a joke about your girlfriend , but the <unk> was just flat .
yeah , it 's not a <unk> .
<unk> , to stop the <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of it .
yes .
thank you for listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me just start with a <unk> question .
why is you going to run <unk> ?
i think everybody who might be the tax tax tax tax , whether he 's going to give up to a moment of society .
the answer is quite clear .
we 've seen that the life expectancy of the birth of the birth is only genetically modified genetically <unk> .
it 's called it , there is to be a lot of environmental , <unk> policies .
so why do we know so little ?
why are we covered by <unk> news from the <unk> , who are opposed to each other ?
you 've ever remember the guilty of the guilty of the guilty .
it was fat .
and you thought , if you look at fat from the food , we 're all <unk> and are healthy .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves shelves with different <unk> in america , and what did n't have changed that americans have become larger than the americans .
then you said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
and then , what the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and so forth .
so it 's always <unk> new <unk> <unk> through the ground .
where all the <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , at least , that we have <unk> <unk> <unk> to scientific wisdom .
for example , for a <unk> , there 's one .
you know , the <unk> are all familiar .
<unk> published a lot of <unk> magazine a new <unk> .
the top <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for this year .
keith <unk> was in place for seven years .
then the newspaper died .
or this lady here .
<unk> <unk> .
the oldest person who has lived in the ground in earth .
<unk> years old .
i know there are somewhere else that claim you , they 're six , but you ca n't find your <unk> .
jean <unk> has become <unk> .
and she listened to smoke to smoke , but with <unk> , then finally , with <unk> , to follow the path of virtue of virtue and welcome to smoke .
it 's a <unk> .
what is that ?
not that cigarettes are healthy .
but it tells us that aging is very complicated , and that we need clean statistics , we need a little bit of <unk> systems , and we need to ask simple questions .
a very simple question , and a very simple thing , and a very simple thing , which is in different countries , women are being used to women are older than men .
what is that ?
we 've seen it .
so that 's the average of the <unk> , which is produced in the male <unk> .
and there 's a very simple proof of the way that men are going to be exactly how women are .
now , now , now , you can consider each other for yourself , whether it 's a <unk> <unk> .
austria is a force .
but there 's better tips , no fear .
it 's not consistent with <unk> ties with <unk> .
it sounds complicated , but it 's easy to illustrate .
so , there 's somebody <unk> <unk> and asks what do you do so different or anything that they were so old ?
ah .
the grandma has 10 cigarettes every day .
that 's the secret of your age , right ?
now , the ten cigarettes , maybe not only do n't .
or you have <unk> , and the grandma would be without the ten cigarettes .
even hard statistics are not always <unk> .
for example , for example , a lot of hard data , which shows that people who are going to come in <unk> in the <unk> .
do n't .
it 's <unk> .
is that the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's about that people just just had enough money in the pocket of your age , and the <unk> diseases of disease .
but if i give a group of <unk> <unk> , and then these group had spent six percent longer than a <unk> <unk> , but otherwise , but otherwise , but otherwise , then , i was actually going to be a <unk> factor in the diet .
and actually , these attempts had been done .
you have to say , `` well , the <unk> is very <unk> , but even though i agree with my enemies , but that <unk> are <unk> the lives .
and this works for a little bit of different organisms .
for example , for bacteria .
you see a <unk> of bacteria .
when we look at the <unk> , in the <unk> line , the pretty much more complicated .
the same is true for <unk> , predators , flies , fly and recently , only about two years ago , in the united states , in the united states , that it 's even for monkeys .
it 's not about being <unk> .
it 's also working with <unk> <unk> .
and this is another experiment in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you 've taken a <unk> <unk> , and the so-called <unk> called <unk> , a <unk> diet , so that 's a <unk> diet , so you get a lot of diet , so many <unk> and night .
and who 's a optimistic , and who did n't have dick , getting sick and have a lot of bad <unk> and bad <unk> .
now you 've taken a sophisticated parallel <unk> , and they 've got exactly the same number of <unk> in the same time that it was actually <unk> .
there 's nothing allowed to eat in the day , they had twice as much .
and these <unk> is <unk> and healthy and they did n't have a <unk> .
and even though they were eating <unk> .
both had a lot of eaten .
a sick and the other healthy .
what 's happening there ?
it 's going to be a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
whenever you get organisms , or cells take food , the organism starts going to go to the organism in the cell or <unk> compounds to make energy back .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how in the cell , in the cell , mainly , to be <unk> , the age of the age .
the <unk> of the stomach that the <unk> are <unk> and the cell to provide energy .
they 're going to be <unk> in the age of the age of the war .
this is really the molecular <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are living in different organisms .
and it 's probably , you know that it 's also going to work in humans .
and we 're learning that they did n't recommend like a little bit of <unk> in the day of the day .
no .
but you 're supposed to say , if you have hunger , ah , maybe the <unk> turned on .
welcome your hunger like a friend .
and it also makes sense of meaning .
in fact , in <unk> , nine nine percent of human history has the person who did , when he had hunger ?
right , he 's gone .
we 're going to get into the fridge , if we have hunger .
and that 's safe in the biology .
now , of course , we know , of course , and this is in the bible , in <unk> <unk> <unk> , the mind is ready , but it 's weak .
paradise looks very different .
this is already a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> garden .
three <unk> here is all right now , the food all day .
and that 's kind of <unk> .
so we 've been looking for the search for one-dimensional , which is the molecular answer to the molecular response of the <unk> , although the organism is .
this could be interesting to people whose <unk> , not enough to <unk> .
and maybe we could protect ourselves from the hardest <unk> of life .
so the question is , so we can <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , although you eat ?
and we have a lot of hundred , the thousand component , natural component .
we have found a found that is called <unk> .
<unk> is a substance which is in all organisms , but also in all organisms .
it 's in the skin .
people have less <unk> in the skin in the skin .
and if we 're going to give <unk> in human cells , for example , you see here .
this is serious cell here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus of it , and we see a lot of thousands of these little <unk> in the cell , which is the crap in the age of the age .
<unk> cells would be like that .
and this works in different organisms .
for example , this is shown in a <unk> .
so we found some substance the molecular <unk> <unk> <unk> .
life because organisms also again .
and the answer is , you see this typical <unk> of a <unk> .
it 's simple <unk> .
after <unk> days , the dead are dead , after stealing days , over half .
whenever we give up in the drinking water , there 's a little bit more than the animals are getting better and survival .
and we also know that human cells that we have from <unk> <unk> <unk> , in culture , as we have so long as long as we have <unk> .
and latest research in the <unk> , which is also very close to all the lives of <unk> mice .
and it 's not just the life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now , of course , you want to know where is <unk> ?
as the name says , it 's been found in sperm , there 's where it comes in very high levels .
but i can <unk> them <unk> , too , in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a product from <unk> <unk> , which is true in japan , which is so <unk> <unk> .
so we said , we 'd be able to be able to help <unk> <unk> by <unk> by preventing the crap in the late <unk> .
and you have to know that the common denominator of all the <unk> diseases are that in the age of <unk> in the brain .
and we did experiments in the fact .
you 're going to wonder , we 've done the fruit flies .
and these flies are also <unk> when they 're old .
they have more <unk> in the brain when they 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are of memory to memory are very similar to people .
now , you 're asking , how the devil has measured the memory of fruit flies ?
this is the experiment we 've done with stephen <unk> of the university berlin .
you take a hundred fruit flies , and there 's a flip of a smell you love .
<unk> .
and let 's go to this <unk> <unk> .
and then they 're going to fly the same way , give you in the next board and give you other things that you love , which is <unk> .
we 're going to enjoy the <unk> , but it 's too serious .
ma <unk> .
and then they 're going to fly the same way again , they 're doing this .
the drive there is , in the <unk> , there 's the <unk> .
and when you 're there , they give up from a page and from another side to another side .
where do all that go ?
sure .
<unk> .
except for the two .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , you have character .
i love my <unk> , and i do n't do it through so serious reward .
okay .
but is a big form of character that is growing .
not just flying .
and we could actually fly the <unk> of flying into <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and the <unk> , which was led to the brain , they were <unk> .
that means , <unk> does n't only be just against aging , but also against <unk> diseases .
and that 's important because we want to have the <unk> increase in the civil war in <unk> .
it does n't make sense the time of the <unk> .
and i do n't want to leave you , without give you a few practical tips , we might potentially get younger .
again , <unk> <unk> .
it 's not about it , you know , it 's the weight or so .
there 's a lot of people in austria , a lot of <unk> people who eat a day and no day .
this is the <unk> called <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the very good thing .
this is called <unk> .
avoid <unk> .
it 's not about carbs .
it 's really about candy .
you know , you know that <unk> <unk> are sufficient to be diabetes .
and you also know that sugar can accelerate growth from tumors .
so you see this <unk> , which is <unk> .
after 30 days , all dead are dead .
it 's a little bit of glucose from glucose .
to create a <unk> effect .
there 's just one example that works in almost all organisms .
eating vegetables and vegetables .
avoid the gift of too much more <unk> or <unk> .
you 've got to know that <unk> and <unk> cancer can be <unk> .
it 's not under the circumstances of vitamin d .
so we 're a level of level , in the winter , there 's a <unk> , of vitamin d in the dark .
for example , you 're at least three times a week , which is trivial .
cigarettes , in spite of the <unk> , <unk> examples , they would be 10 to 10 to six years .
and they 're in times of the eternal <unk> of the eternal <unk> .
the influence of praying and blood pressure on the life expectancy is study .
because the monks of the world is almost like women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , life more than <unk> .
<unk> life longer than <unk> .
but <unk> live longer than <unk> .
just <unk> dying as a <unk> .
what is that ?
people assume that has to do what to do with some emulation .
no way , no way , it 's simple .
now , when there 's an illustration of the window on the window , then i 'm going to go out of the <unk> solution .
and what happens is probably going to happen in your <unk> .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what , are <unk> in <unk> circumstances .
so alcohol , it 's <unk> <unk> .
a tough partner has a hard partner or a lot of family with longevity .
you should n't have a lot of the <unk> street .
now you think about the same way .
but that 's nothing to do with anything .
it 's about <unk> .
you can have to measure somebody to a much <unk> street , the more <unk> in blood .
and also , when he says , i 've got to be used to it .
i 'm going to sleep good and the noise does n't do it .
not true .
he has more <unk> in blood and this is bad .
so sunlight should be powered because of course , of course .
we know that there 's a lot of a good amount of metabolic effects .
mostly it can lower the <unk> .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice are <unk> against <unk> .
and the idea of the way we knew how to have the grandmothers , and we 've got to have <unk> <unk> and so forth .
not without meaning .
several studies show that dark chocolate can be <unk> against dementia .
just recently , a nice study , which has shown that a piece of a panel is dark .
and the same thing you think about coffee is the data but <unk> .
there are studies that show , there are studies that do n't show .
what is what is , is that coffee are <unk> in diabetes and so their metabolic performance improved .
and the way of coffee is also a good <unk> , because it could be able to show the <unk> , how we could show up with <unk> <unk> .
so a very nice nice and <unk> study had been studied for a hundred thousand people in a hundred people in a hundred thousand people have been shown in hundreds of years , that people who are spending a lot of birds to lower their <unk> .
this is a huge value for serious study .
and this applies to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but it 's not in peanuts , right ?
they 're just going to give you , by <unk> , okay ?
but that 's not right .
so for peanuts , it 's not .
the next point is a little bit difficult .
they avoid the recording to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only when they 're between <unk> and <unk> years .
so a very nice new study suggests that when you take a lot of animal protein , you have to take a lot of animal protein , they 're going to increase your <unk> protein , when they would be a strong one .
this is not for time for the time where animal proteins are all , and it 's not for <unk> kids or adolescents , the animal proteins need and do it to be pregnant and
they actually avoid <unk> .
whatever you do , you 're going to go , you know , the <unk> nietzsche , who said , `` the <unk> , '' who said , `` the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of health .
everything is heard in the medical school .
this is the gentleman called <unk> <unk> , and he lived in this regime , and it 's been <unk> years old .
it comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never getting sick .
and he 's very good .
it 's not a <unk> <unk> , but he 's not living in a <unk> , where there 's a lot of healthy <unk> .
he followed about the <unk> , which i told you today .
now , we should have a lot of these things that we do n't have about the <unk> of the most important fact .
so , because the <unk> of the <unk> does n't be a biological system , but it seems to be a <unk> , and eventually a <unk> .
you know , you 're less less less than that , and could be one of the <unk> mistakes of our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel of the biggest novel a year ago .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece of work on the contemporary critic of all the teenage <unk> <unk> .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm going to do .
one question , where do n't you have to get up because it 's a little bit of <unk> who is lonely ?
the <unk> is very little .
lower than i thought .
but it probably has no reasons why they did n't have been reported , and the people who would have been <unk> .
many people do <unk> and loneliness and you might think that would be <unk> .
that 's not the case .
now , cardiac <unk> is actually a phenomenon of people in human being alone .
perhaps it 's also because it 's not that you do n't have signed because the question is going to be <unk> .
you feel like a lonely , or is you lonely ?
you can feel lonely , without being a lonely .
and you can be trained without feeling a lonely moment .
and loneliness to do a lot of shame .
also , also , this is also going to be <unk> at <unk> to <unk> .
loneliness is in shame and shame in loneliness .
loneliness .
and so now , there 's no reported here in the few seconds that i gave you .
loneliness .
in loneliness , the time you need to be aware of all .
and loneliness and loneliness do n't need to talk to talk about this .
and this exercise is not a lot .
we do n't have the language yet , and we have to see signs of ourselves , when are we lonely ?
there 's the loneliness of two <unk> that i 'm still in again .
one part of humanity says , it 's a start from lonely .
from birth to death , you 're actually lonely .
there are a few moments in life where you can the <unk> .
these people are going to go to <unk> and drive all the day .
i do n't have time , it 's like your <unk> .
and then there 's people who are not less high , who says everything is connected .
i 'm not really , so i 'm just one part of the big universe .
and there 's the big group of the people i also have the most part of the same one , so i think .
and the idea , okay , today i am lonely and the next day , well , it 's hangs all together .
when we think of loneliness , all of the first loneliness is a lot of loneliness .
the loneliness of the <unk> who are loneliness to a intensive care .
but about these <unk> , about these large <unk> <unk> , i do n't talk to you today , but i want to talk about the little , about everyday <unk> , where loneliness to be in such a theater .
i do n't want to talk about burden and <unk> .
loneliness to other countries , most of us are not difficult to us in our <unk> to us not find up to us .
photographer christine <unk> <unk> did a few photos i want to show you .
how easy it is always going to be in other loneliness .
now we do n't know if these people felt really lonely in this moment .
but who does n't know what it 's not , the moment on the <unk> event , where you think you think everybody 's talking to each other , you 're something lost in the corner and has no one .
these all of all right now , in spite of loneliness .
maybe some you might have experienced today .
what you do is to do it , you know , the cell phone looks like a lot of the cell phone , which is the <unk> , which is the <unk> on the cell phone .
clearly , when you look at the display .
what we do n't do here now .
and then , and then there 's loneliness , which is in front of you , in the loneliness of a <unk> , hundreds of <unk> faces in front of you , and you 're not paying attention to hope that you do n't forget his text .
these are the <unk> you see from the outside .
we give people to people .
but i 'm sure there 's another person in the room who are taught from birth to teach their entire life , by trying to get these loneliness .
and there are also in this room , and there 's also people who are also telling people who are lonely , because they have to give you to another person , it 's because of the death of value .
there 's no idea that there 's nothing like that , also , also , people who are connected to them , they 're all of feeling lonely .
and there are people who have lost not to be able to find out of themselves , and they are taught .
i 'm betting the digital loneliness .
and sit down to the <unk> loneliness .
the analog loneliness is not familiar .
these are people who think of their belief in social contacts .
it 's still a relative .
there 's no official number , no <unk> number , when someone else has enough to be .
and there 's the old people immediately .
it 's the <unk> form of loneliness .
since since we have all in cities , all of a lot of people in facebook or facebook or facebook is that digital loneliness has become bigger .
you can be connected with hundreds of people without being connected to a single person .
is it in the analog , rather than the data of human relationships , it 's missing in the digital loneliness .
the two forms of loneliness are very often against each other .
it 's also about that , the analog to occur in a little bit of a little bit more <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness is good for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's the <unk> of the digital loneliness in the future , when the opportunities are getting together , it 's bigger .
i do n't know if you 're in six years of this sense of what 's going to be very similar to a loneliness .
or if you find a new term .
but these are also the issues of the <unk> generation .
almost greater than loneliness , is the fear of loneliness and from this fear of loneliness to people are happy .
<unk> , the big <unk> , also , a <unk> man , <unk> wrote a wonderful <unk> .
in the act of what people are doing , what people do n't do to be alone .
they build cathedrals , the witnesses who then are lonely and then .
but the <unk> did n't call to <unk> the fear of loneliness , which is money .
<unk> go .
things <unk> .
and the process of all over the process , the loneliness , because it 's at least not a touch , and the objects itself , the objects that you have stolen .
the problem is that it helps it , and it 's going to be the <unk> of loneliness .
so we have to buy new things , and we have to buy new things .
i 've seen the commercials for a <unk> heart attack .
and the <unk> <unk> are <unk> from mobile communication with the idea of it .
and what that 's doing is to do with your panties , you do n't know , but it seems to work .
so loneliness to do n't have anything to do with the <unk> , right under people who are .
<unk> <unk> wrote a wonderful poem , and there 's a verse on the worst that 's loneliness .
hand on the heart , who knows that ?
in a relationship or looking at the other or the other hand , and all of the sudden , has been a feeling of feeling alone , may be terrible and <unk> , who is that person actually ?
i 've got to do with anything ?
one study says that in the <unk> women are about the upper women , married , with kids , feel .
this is missing , because i do n't know about whether i invented the study of the study as often i 've told them .
but in fact , there 's no matter because at least , at least , at least , at least in studies , it 's mostly anyway , and the response is the same thing that people are in front of me .
that 's the same thing that it 's completely obvious , almost a <unk> .
in loneliness to <unk> , every <unk> and still do n't talk about it .
talk about the <unk> of loneliness .
it 's probably all experienced that .
again , when you have a sudden , suddenly , i think , what do i do here ?
who is this person in my bed ?
also , a form of loneliness to do n't necessarily have to do with the quality of the <unk> .
also nothing to do with the quality of quality .
it 's just always there .
we 're just talking about them because we do n't look at it .
we 're not talking about it in the workforce .
in the workforce , loneliness is also <unk> as we think .
i stood up with <unk> <unk> , and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better , three remarks suit , and two led <unk> .
the two men have taught who have both women have been entertained .
and in between , something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in the hand of the <unk> .
i think i have to give you the scene at all of the things that they 've been able to have this shape of loneliness .
it 's the loneliness of the <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness of the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see here , maybe there 's some of these lives in <unk> .
in <unk> , in hotels , in hotels , in hotels , in hotels , in a hotels , in <unk> bars , they 're often not even aware of who they actually do .
where they 're going to wake up .
it 's a form of loneliness , which is not spoken about .
it 's just as <unk> as loneliness .
<unk> is parallel .
i told me a <unk> story that he was called by a clients , and the said , it 's what happens , you ca n't imagine it .
a <unk> was in the state alone .
so he has the <unk> .
and two months later , it 's also <unk> .
the loneliness is never going to be alone .
it 's always going to be connected with other emotion .
she 's nice siblings , and she has ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings we all know .
fear , grief of everlasting despair and shame .
but we should not forget the beautiful siblings .
the freedom of the pride is the desire to the <unk> .
so my plea is to look at the loneliness .
come and goes in the life like the tide and flood .
let them go and do n't go from her .
because there 's some kind of worse than loneliness and that 's the empty , which may be more likely to be more than anything .
loneliness is part of life .
for me , i 've been thinking so much about loneliness .
one in my <unk> , i did n't have a dictator of the <unk> , i realized that i did n't have a <unk> , because he did n't get <unk> because i 've got to lose me , maybe i 'd be able to get <unk> .
i 've been invented since i 've been able to have the loneliness to my life , and let me go to people .
that 's what it is with the <unk> that you do .
it 's also free to be free .
people are going to go and go to <unk> , they do n't get back in the process , whether it was a friendship or a friendship or a partnership .
as a kid , i found my parents very embarrassing .
you can not have a conversation with a conversation without having a conversation .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
each time , it led to <unk> talks .
as a kid , i found some embarrassing .
as a young adult , i 've got it incredibly to have this openness .
but only since i 've ever since loneliness , at least , at least , you know , and again , i 'm going to be able to open up and open up .
you 're going to be able to be able to be able to feel for a game .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i 've got three instances of this .
a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now i 'm going to say , you know , if you 're just accessing the <unk> , you know ?
most people would choose to choose for the <unk> .
and that 's a very good idea .
and why ?
because we 're dealing with the most precious effect on the most important effect .
in health , we do it kind of different .
and so let 's work there with the largest effect , except for eight strategies .
for example , we choose to give us for the <unk> and the cartoon .
big <unk> is great effort .
that 's not so valuable .
or we decide the <unk> .
it 's diet .
but also very big <unk> , but still very big effort .
so for me , not so valuable .
and i want to tell you what you 're doing with the least effort of the world 's largest <unk> .
when you get in prevention and health , you 're not going to go to a topic .
and the theme is called <unk> .
and it 's not a subject in germany , so about the <unk> .
and then there was a number of overweight people in germany .
and i asked me , what was there in the <unk> ?
so why did i <unk> up to the top ?
and i grew up to research , and i grew up too <unk> .
because it was in the years .
what was there ?
there was <unk> .
and we are always going to get more and more .
and i looked at the way .
<unk> comes from germany to germany .
and the obesity epidemic .
and in the years , the curve is still going to go on .
and what 's coming in germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and we are always going to get more and more .
well , i got one and a <unk> .
because it was obvious .
sports , dick .
and of course , i 'm not here today , to tell you that sports is thick .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we have in common .
the tide of new training , and it did n't led to be <unk> that we 're going to <unk> and healthier .
so what is it then ?
diet ?
and there 's a lot of great study in the states .
the problem with syndrome .
and they 've launched in the <unk> <unk> .
and then they wanted to look at what 's happening here ?
and they 've seen the people actually have less fat , but they 're still getting less calories but still more .
and that was paradox .
and so they 've called it called <unk> .
we can explain that ?
there are you allowed to imagine the power like a power station .
there 's so serious <unk> .
and on the one side , there 's a <unk> , there 's all the whole <unk> who 's going down here .
and here is the energy <unk> as electricity .
but if we 're going to give more <unk> in our power plant than we use on the other side , and we use the energy in power and power .
the human body does n't be white .
you can store the energy .
and this is in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
but what happens when we 've never heard less as we 've heard of energy , and yet , even though , it turns out , it 's going to be a conclusion .
the <unk> are dramatically <unk> .
there 's no life at all .
we are only mobile .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents were <unk> at six kilometers at foot .
and we 're going to get a bit of a until two miles and these are the positive estimates .
there are studies that report on five -- to <unk> meters .
i 'm telling you a little bit of my friend mike ,
give me the chair ?
mike , are you a level of level ?
mike is americans .
he 's shy , he 's not talking a lot .
and he was at this study and sitting here .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he 's got a <unk> in the hand .
and mike will always be less and less and less and less and <unk> , and still it 's always <unk> and more .
why ?
because mike is just sitting on .
and i watched a little bit like <unk> mike , and he gave him a <unk> in the pocket in the pocket and the night .
and there 's a thousand steps .
this was so the distance , which mike 's mike talks about the car in the office with the car , of course , of course , of course , of course , there 's a little bit of coffee and back back .
and he came to a thousand steps .
this is mike , mike 's 10 minutes on his day .
<unk> hours , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
under these conditions , disease comes from alone .
and mike is not going to be <unk> , because it 's too much food because so long as long , it 's not as long , but not as long energy , but not as long , but not as long as it 's going to be more <unk> and energy .
and first of the power , the energy , like you see , you see , you see , you see , you see , you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , not there .
the <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> blood .
and also , she 's active and <unk> and quiet on his <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so when the energy <unk> into blood , the doctors are <unk> <unk> and high <unk> .
and that <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , it 's like <unk> , <unk> holes in these <unk> .
and a happiness is , there 's the whole fat of the fat and the <unk> are now going to be in these little wounds and we 're talking about <unk> or <unk> .
and now , <unk> heart is very much lower , because now he has to get the blood through these tight <unk> <unk> , and we talk about blood pressure .
and when the air quality , then , it 's got a <unk> , it 's also <unk> .
and when the heart happens , we call the heart attack .
and if that happens in the head , we call the stroke .
and in germany , the second person dying of heart attacks and stroke .
that means , in germany , every second is in <unk> .
and <unk> is not going to be sick because it 's not going to be a sports , but it 's not going to go .
and if you do n't know these things , then you 're going to look at the wrong place .
for example , for the subject .
and i 've got a little bit of dieting again , and there 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and if each book is just as a centimeter , and we would be <unk> , we would have a 30 meter of <unk> <unk> .
and i read the read for you all .
and there 's there , and this is really important if you 're going to consume more energy than they use , then they 're going to use them .
and if you get less energy than you use it , they 're going to be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why do we need a lot of books ?
that 's just a conclusion .
the need is , of course , is there is a lot of aid that is not aid .
because why is a diet of a diet ?
because it 's a diet , and no lifestyle .
now , what are on the things that we 're going to do three weeks , and there 's five weeks , if five weeks , when we go to this fight , again in the normal lifestyle , to our regular lifestyle .
what 's going to be five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except for <unk> and again , the self-confidence that we did n't have done again , what we did .
so you 're allowed to go back in every new diet , in each new <unk> , and you want to integrate in your everyday lives in their lifestyle .
yeah , or no ?
and then , when you go .
and if no , they 're just going to remain it .
because when the end of the night , it 's pure local .
it 's the habits that are choosing whether we 're getting sick or healthy .
it 's the bad habits that are getting sick .
and it 's the good habits that are healthy .
and if mike in the mirror , it looks like the result of his daily lifestyle .
when mike looks in the mirror , it looks there his everyday habits .
and when mike 's <unk> in the mirror , and it 's too honest , and then he looks like it 's going to go .
because when he 's more bad habits than good , he 's in the direction of the disease .
and when mike is going to be the direction of your goals , the dreams , he does n't have to change his life .
and then he just need to be good habits than bad .
and a <unk> habits <unk> <unk> is a great example of that person is a weird animal .
mike has done it for example , and it 's completely transformed by his day-to-day life by <unk> with the car , and it 's using each store ,
and at night , he 's <unk> on the couch , and somehow it has to come to motion .
so he sits down in his <unk> path , and it 's going to be called <unk> , which is a <unk> , and then it 's <unk> <unk> , and then it 's going to be a <unk> , again , it 's kind of to come to movement .
and my grandpa have had exactly like this <unk> .
it was a farmer and that did n't understand that .
they said , sports is not for people .
and somehow he 's right .
so why do we have to learn to night in our precious hand , what we 've lost in your everyday life ?
we 've got to do with this <unk> lifestyle .
now , it 's much easier to find the movement where we 've lost it .
in your day .
and so i 'm going to <unk> you today .
and you may also know the situation , you know , you 're looking at the situation , and you 're still going to go back at the first place that 's no place .
and you see , you see , you see , you see , you see something called <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
we 're going to want to go to a long time .
we 're planning our homes so that we have the <unk> paths .
we 're designing our whole life that we have the <unk> paths , but it 's not going to be there , but we do n't get there , where we <unk> .
it 's a very different direction .
that 's why you 're allowed to activate the <unk> , and they find the movement over and find the movement again , where they came up .
so , i 'm going to drive to the track .
and i am the only one that 's always up and down , and down , and go down and go down and go down and all else .
but when i 've got there , i 'm a time , i 'm the time for me .
and then i <unk> the movement that 's just sitting there .
and when of the top of the top comes down , 30 minutes , you know , i 'm <unk> .
<unk> steps .
these are about three times <unk> .
and a <unk> steps , if you go back every day , which is going to be more likely to go to the end of the day , in the end of the day , you ca n't <unk> out of fat .
maybe that may sound quite a little bit .
but as a <unk> , as a habit , as a habit of <unk> days in the year , we 'll talk about four point five pounds of fat .
we do n't have in our bodies .
and you give me a degree of it , and i 'm going to <unk> it .
the americans are crazy , you know , this is what you do .
this is a <unk> of five pounds fat .
are the idea of four pounds .
just you see what happens with these little steps .
and when the effect is from this perspective , which is what i mean , what happens when you 're going to be in a active life .
and these <unk> are going to get in their everyday lives .
once you have <unk> steps per day , it 's going to go to all the <unk> .
and then , when you do , and then you have time , you do this on top .
and then you 're next to the <unk> <unk> .
they 're still getting faster and stronger .
but they do n't do their health care of sports .
so they do n't get their health care of your body and from her time .
because the most important most important thing that do you do every day as a lifestyle .
and i 'm going to <unk> a active lifestyle .
and for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , for me , it 's a <unk> decision based on the life and for me .
because i think it 's not to do with what we should do or do .
it 's to do what we want to do .
and that 's why i 'm just one idea for you .
you 're just going to take the best .
and you know , you know how it goes .
step for step .
thank you very much .
<unk> , how did it have an leonardo da vinci , <unk> way to see the world with other eyes ?
and that 's how far on the music , which is just a little bit more easy , historically ?
could we do this ?
now , maybe it might have to do what ?
and how can we express power and confidence for our future ?
let 's start with the question , what do we actually understand innovation ?
sure .
technology 's innovations , even the official <unk> of the federal government , '' <unk> the administration .
so you know me right .
that 's all great .
and we can be very proud of it , and grateful that we have <unk> in such a fields that our <unk> are all over the world that 's going to be good .
that is that we have such an extraordinary , unique wealth .
but what about the future ?
what are challenges , because of society ?
and who cares , because of the great environmental and social challenges ?
so , it seems to be kind of <unk> .
it 's a kind of content .
so the economy , the economy of the future challenges , because the entrepreneurs then we have big effort with productivity and efficiency .
and the world are better going to do better in the nonprofit organizations and together and together and <unk> and <unk> , and then you have to have a lot of <unk> , and then of course , of course , to remove the damage of the <unk> economy .
at least we repair repair .
but who is , who says we have to look at all the whole thing as diverse ?
how is it because if we bring our <unk> social and cultural dimension ?
now , if technological innovations also are cultural innovations ?
now , when economic innovations also are social innovations ?
when we have been able to think about these <unk> , and we sent to work with the solution of big environmental and social challenges ?
now , when it 's all the other things that are missing in a whole world , and when it could have been a very different , fair <unk> development ?
because it was ?
both sides wanted to be what companies would have , right ?
can we do this ?
you may be asking yourself .
so far , we 've got this as a conflict .
happiness is encouraging examples .
neurological yunus has been <unk> with his <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> in bangladesh to <unk> poverty .
and interestingly , in the direct <unk> , what the state administration is done .
and he 's got <unk> as a entrepreneur , perhaps the nobel prize winner .
the opportunity there is , i 'm going to be able to do with someone else .
now , i 'm going to imagine <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the subtle guy .
<unk> <unk> , but it 's also <unk> his ideal .
and yeah , it 's totally <unk> .
i 'd like to sound .
and if you see , you think , really , the offspring , we need to worry about our future .
well , in the university , he would have started to work somewhere in one of our <unk> <unk> .
and that 's what he looks very well .
it 's called him , and there 's a very successful .
and yet , there 's something like this .
so he asks , there is no longer , that 's kind of in me ?
that 's how the main <unk> says he 's going to go .
<unk> are in all <unk> .
and that too .
and he also like this <unk> .
so there 's the right there in the <unk> , which has been discovered .
so not that he knows it personally , but so the <unk> says , it 's telling him .
and there in the middle of the t in the middle of the t he did n't know .
so the more , it was surprised to be surprised when he was introduced to him as a <unk> .
as mister mister <unk> .
and as a <unk> entrepreneur , he showed up there .
so the it 's great pleasure , so with young people , his experience feeling .
and the two have shown two things .
and have been met .
how would it be so much like this talk about the two times ?
yeah , mister <unk> , so that was just .
what 's exactly the difference between the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
i did n't know that .
yeah , so , then we 're going to begin with the question , what is <unk> <unk> ?
so , the name is , it 's already .
<unk> markets , developed products , developed clients , <unk> structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also be quite visible in which the big shapes are <unk> .
and once <unk> <unk> , even when it 's very <unk> , it 's also .
what is a <unk> ?
so <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it
it 's something very different .
it 's a completely different character .
because there 's nothing like it .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
so of course , a little bit of a temporary organization to be able to find the purpose to find a business model , which is the default model , of course , which is , it 's <unk> , and then it 's scale .
and you 're going to understand that , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , there 's a lot of new ways , very different ways , different ways , very different ways .
yeah , that 's all of me .
but what are we looking at ?
so , i 'm going to go to you , i 'm going to give you a little bit of money to make money or do it ?
so , i 've got out there , which fits quite well , so <unk> are found in berlin .
this is called <unk> .
how you 've done your company in public service , and after all of your life .
oh no .
real <unk> ?
what do you do you think if you have your <unk> money , what about your <unk> ?
so , then you <unk> a career as a <unk> , or what ?
what happens to your engagement , how do i know ?
and also , let 's look at the <unk> .
so the statistics are not going to give you a <unk> perspective , because you 've got a <unk> perspective because 70 percent of all <unk> are very few years after a lot of financial crisis as a lot of
money is always the outcome of a successful company and a good <unk> company .
clearly , money is a source of <unk> .
and it 's the basis of the ground for economic management assistance .
but it 's never the target of a company .
yeah , what is the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i get to go and learn , so no goal is no way of right .
and so , goals would have to be a lot of measurable and in order to be so on .
and if i do that , so , so , so , so , how can i do something like i do n't know what ?
so that 's no good feeling .
so how to do i want to decide , because , and risks and risks , it feels like all and <unk> .
yeah , <unk> welcome to the <unk> .
but i could have some of what you have .
a thread .
so this is already <unk> , so almost secret .
successful <unk> of generation <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , how do you say today ?
<unk> , i think , <unk> ?
so we 're still going to say that 's <unk> .
now , in fact , blindness and <unk> and <unk> are viable uncertainty .
so everybody helps .
i think i can give you one of you .
okay .
yeah , thank you , mister !
but there 's just the questions on it .
and that can be one of the most important <unk> of the most powerful social networking , for example .
can we get the back to one of the other , that maybe maybe it might be better ?
so the first is , what am i here , and what do i make here ?
yeah , <unk> , there 's <unk> what 's moving on you , bigger than you ?
what are you doing on the world ?
what did people have people when you work with you ?
what are you ready ?
what are your inner , maybe even unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important to realize ?
because that 's the <unk> <unk> .
and how did we learn this ?
and if you do n't want to build a ship , the men are together with parts of wood to wood , but they teach them , desire to be a <unk> , <unk> ocean .
yes , good .
so i got the next questions .
what is my <unk> <unk> ?
what does that mean ?
yeah , you know , now , you can actually get your target .
in detail , in detail , but i 'm <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what you 're going to do , what you do n't want to get it on you .
do you know the story with the pink elephant ?
there 's a degree .
not ?
<unk> .
so , again .
do n't give you a pink <unk> .
okay ?
does it work ?
so no pink elephant .
do you know ?
no pink elephant .
you see ?
this is how we focus on what we do n't want .
what is the only way to have ?
there 's a <unk> ?
yes , wait for what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the <unk> on the <unk> .
but wait for you .
by the way , what you can do is , you know , right ?
i brought there .
you know , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
who ?
at <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me to <unk> me to the time of the period of the time , <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i 'm going to talk about my <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> smith .
oh , what 's the <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
it 's a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
and <unk> like it looks like ?
is what struck ?
has something changed ?
okay .
okay , the flower is too .
okay .
so let 's look at where the bear has remained .
and action .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> smith .
who ?
at <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me to <unk> my <unk> at the time of the time , <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i 'm going to talk about my <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> smith .
and <unk> , how do you go ?
so i know , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i saw the first time .
i thought it could n't be it .
and yet , a lot of shocked , i was going to go through my head , it would be the whole time in the neighborhood ?
by my life .
and okay , i do n't understand it totally sense .
in the top of the top of the top , to avoid the immediate immediate <unk> , we need to have the most of our perception and our <unk> first .
but what 's happening now ?
what i was and what i was and what did i mean ?
and so that 's why , you can see your perception of the perception of <unk> , is a lot more important <unk> quality .
well , yeah , thank you , then we go to the next question .
how could i get my goal ?
so , i think that 's good question .
which is what i 'm looking for each other , and i do n't even know .
yes , <unk> , there 's good news for you .
so this is going to be easier to fall , as you might have known as well .
because if you see your destiny , your inner code , and if you put a little bit of the <unk> , you know , i promise you to you , it 's going to happen in its own .
almost automatic .
you 're not going to be different than that a brainstorming is going to happen to you .
these are the famous <unk> that you have in the shower in the morning .
and there 's a problem , i swear to you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
and you have a big model .
and the <unk> have the terrific <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> , when the <unk> did n't know , in a <unk> , in florence .
for lunch , the famous big table .
and that 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politician , charity , <unk> engineers , architects , and he has a lot of intense <unk> .
but not in our sense of our senses , where it was on , yes , who 's going on ?
who 's right ?
but rather than all of these different <unk> things came out of these different types of things that would have been done in a way of which they could have done alone .
well , yeah , yeah , yeah , the next question is , what a particular next step is going to do ?
<unk> , there 's a successful entrepreneur in the cause .
instead of planning and management and so on the next step on the next step .
because what should you do in uncertainty ?
but the very determined , and with all the consequence .
and if it was n't it , you know , dan , you 're looking at <unk> other step .
and even if the big , lower , <unk> <unk> is n't it .
so it 's so important that you know .
that 's the inner safety .
and the rest of how do we have all been able to run ?
even though we did n't know that , and there 's no one said ?
you know , you know , you 're going to say there 's <unk> in children .
so , this looks like this rather , this looks like this , and this kind of <unk> looks like this , it 's also a fun thing that 's fun in a business .
and that 's kind of like the <unk> of the uncertainty that you get empowered .
yeah , thank you .
so that sounds really great .
but i do n't know , in the company , i think that there 's a lot of bosses have to change that anything .
and in fact , in germany , there 's always a common mood .
and i think , because the politicians have to worry about that .
okay , my boy , come on .
how do it go down to the water .
what do you think how many people can do you ?
ten ?
tens of thousands ?
ten million ?
look at this .
who you see ?
right , that .
that 's the one you can change you to change .
or about mahatma gandhi , the change that you 're looking at in the world in you .
do you think of nice words and great role models , but how do we work ?
there 's also a <unk> , we have some <unk> in our <unk> .
being helpful in all sorts of crises or if you feel like a little bit , or when you feel a <unk> , and they all have to do with you .
and if you ask you in some situations what you 're going to show you now , in spite of you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know what posture are you going to be physically to feel powerful .
ask you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , what you 're going to do with you , you know , you know , you know , you know you guys .
and at the end , ask you , ask you what you actually actually have about this crisis or what 's bad thing happened .
so i mean , when it 's going to happen to you , you know , it 's worth about it .
yes .
<unk> <unk> .
and do you think that 's really really helpful to my <unk> path ?
yes .
and you see two things .
first , the number one is on the clarity of your inner body , which is to go to your expertise .
because your perception is .
and the second dog is on your inner attitude to you .
because it 's like you like the other people to behave .
the future is only going to change your own perception .
you know ?
yeah , i think you have .
thank you , so , you know .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what do you think about our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how do we do it right now ?
is that a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
all right .
so i look at all the <unk> .
<unk> is called <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> really is really .
a <unk> of the <unk> .
and no , new <unk> , <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
it 's just a long time in the great famous name .
robert bosch from <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they all say .
let 's just <unk> this mind .
and who may have stopped from our <unk> of our history of our time .
you see , i 'm a <unk> .
so maybe it would be <unk> that i 'm going to do with kids and the future , because of course , kids are our future .
instead , this is the view of the most part of the most of the time .
i have a great my life in prison .
four years ago , my father , and i was making the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for <unk> .
we 're <unk> <unk> , which means that you can either be able to make any mobile phone or find out of her , and they would be able to find a piece of going to make a workplace .
so why do i mean to <unk> , so those who failed are made the great mistakes ?
our program is not far as easy to understand how the programs are working .
and in fact , i would have thought that the <unk> of the last place in the universe is where i would work .
what do you think is the most important missing factor in the childhood that we work with ?
we found out there are positive models , often <unk> positive models .
and if you think about why there 's a lot of <unk> and so many <unk> and so many <unk> are often that he did n't have a reasonable work that he did not have drugs or that he sits in prison .
and if you find a <unk> boy about what he wants to do from his life , he might have no better idea how a different life could look like , because it does n't have better role models .
and he <unk> his father .
i 'm just looking at martin .
martin is <unk> of our program .
his father was an alcoholic and made the whole family to the hell .
when he was 12 , his mother had died and his little brother had to go into the home .
there was the <unk> of the great .
he was shy and <unk> and so the perfect victim .
until his day , when it was a little brother of a soccer football , that 's the ground on the ground .
and there was <unk> at martin times , he went to the enemy and he found .
and from this day , he was respects .
and so it was walking .
violence was part of the day in his life , right ?
how about the person i 've just described , right ?
after all of childhood , a lot of things are a lot of unemployed or have <unk> .
they do n't know much other than their illegal activity and their <unk> .
and then you 'll fall a day in jail in prison where they 're in prison , which is the idea of the same , the same is not a better role models .
what do you think these people are in common ?
most good .
and they 're going to be <unk> criminals in the <unk> .
they sell drugs to a higher level and plan in the fall where they could be in the fall of sleep .
and then that leads to germany to <unk> percent .
that 's called in germany , every <unk> criminal criminals are <unk> .
but there 's also people in prison that would really want to change .
but these people also carry on the forehead .
and there is <unk> .
and everywhere you get your first identity .
whether you 're looking for a workplace , whether they 're looking for a apartment , whether they want to build new private relationships , they 're going to provide with this identity , which is to be a bit difficult for society .
this is the problem we are .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what are the quality , do you have a lot of <unk> ?
you 're going to be surprised .
it 's <unk> capabilities .
who 's got a <unk> , you know , <unk> , from <unk> and <unk> .
you 've got a little bit of <unk> , and it 's not in the prison .
these are the traits that we want to be with something positive .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three <unk> .
we convey the basics of entrepreneurship and economies .
everybody 's subjects who write his own <unk> , and everyone is going to be a comprehensive <unk> .
and then we get the people in the custody of the <unk> , with the <unk> of their personal relationships and also in a different <unk> .
what about <unk> do this program ?
it 's a big range of the <unk> to the agency .
we have a <unk> .
a very large range of bandwidth , and i want to introduce you to you to introduce you to injury .
<unk> <unk> and his illusion of the <unk> money , have been a <unk> .
he was always fun to run business .
he 's got arrested for the first time .
and this lady is not quite impressed .
in the opposite .
he says it 's going to be prepared for the end of this day .
it 's <unk> for the second time .
and then he took a therapy for a therapy , and then the <unk> .
and there was how he learned how to be a <unk> talent for something called <unk> .
he 's been <unk> in september 13 , then october his agency .
the agency is going to be right now , and he can have life .
he worked very good <unk> .
he 's with me today .
who wants to do that , you want to talk to him .
even back to martin , from the beginning i had told him .
martin was going to be a education , and i ended up a education , and he ended up in his spare time in the <unk> .
and there 's alcohol and drugs on the agenda , it was pretty close to the <unk> .
he was working with parallel and <unk> .
he ran this life .
and he says , today , it 's not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be existing self-confidence .
one day , he injured someone in a <unk> , so hard he was convicted .
he took the most part of the <unk> and the <unk> has changed there .
he learned how to make more force and more of the quality of bodies could be without being able to consume his air .
and he was about his insights to be <unk> that he had to pass this to it .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
this was the idea .
now , he 's going to work on two years , and <unk> our subjects on the way , because he knows that if you want to change the right tools that 's much more possible than you want to be
the basis of these successes are at the way , by the way .
people who come in prison , the <unk> are <unk> with us to talk to our participants in their <unk> .
these are our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our teaching , these are students who are students to do the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and these are our mentors who are playing with our participants in the sleep .
and these people also take a lot of our program .
one example .
we 're going to do a practice called a practice called <unk> .
we put in the middle of the space in the middle of the space and we put a great <unk> of our participants in the space , and our lives are on the other side .
and i 'll ask you different questions .
and every time , when anyone in the room , he 's answered this question .
and here 's what we 're all in common , whether we 're in the prison , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and one example of where the differences are .
i grew up in a `` social social <unk> , or i had a family which was in custody .
there are a lot of our participants in front of the line , and very few of our people .
one question i like to make all the link to us all , which i 'd like to do .
and i 'm going to give you all the time you all get up .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see it .
it 's all .
terrific .
thank you .
i 'm going to give you a question , and if you do n't answer this question , you 're just going to stand up .
this is kind of our line that we 're going to take .
i 've done in my life in my life of illegal things that i could have been punished but not .
if you 're the question , you 're going to answer these questions .
and there 's no way to be <unk> .
and that 's also , perhaps , perhaps a lot of <unk> .
and there 's no <unk> .
okay .
and there 's also also , maybe each trial is not going to have been quite <unk> .
all right .
most of them are sitting .
we have a few angels in the room .
this is wonderful , there i am glad .
thank you , you can get rid of them .
now , in this question , if we 're looking at the events , our people come in , and we 're often excited .
and there 's also clear how much happiness might have happened .
happiness with parents , happiness with the environment , in the environment , in the environment , with the friends , but also also luck to the friends , but also also to happiness , perhaps they were not going to be caught in the friends , if you 've done something on the edge of the <unk> or more .
what are the results of our work ?
by <unk> percent of our alumni , from the <unk> days after their <unk> , a workplace .
so that 's rapidly fast .
<unk> percent have already done in each other .
one third of the donors are <unk> .
and our <unk> is in seven percent .
i 've already said that the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany .
i am retired .
a <unk> cost into <unk> per year , <unk> dollars a year .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> of seven percent of the <unk> percent of a <unk> .
when my father and i 've started designing the <unk> , we 've been a open very crazy very crazy .
i gave up my great <unk> in a big company .
but i have to tell you , i did n't have a <unk> work .
we encourage our participants in taking responsibility .
responsibility , which is happening in your life , and all of all of it is going to take responsibility to what 's going to happen in your life .
not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new self and allows it to build the trust .
and that 's why it 's really happy , and i 'm really proud of our subjects on your way .
so , i brought you a little video .
film .
so i was convicted of two years , and eight months ago , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> against the <unk> , and 10 months .
i traded the <unk> .
so , i have judgment from two years , because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation , my whole range is actually changed my complete life .
and what was important for me was this <unk> , which is also done .
because i was , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , <unk> , i 'm sure , yes .
i 've got back of goals .
and i found out of perspective back .
and you 're going to go with a very different sense of consciousness and self-confidence .
and there was more and more <unk> goals , and then you 're still going to go into anything .
with the wrong people , and there 's not anymore .
well , the problem is that a lot of thing is not a <unk> , when they get out .
so the biggest problem because it 's automatically <unk> , you get the old <unk> .
you do n't know anything else .
and by this <unk> individual individual , no matter , what has no to be just my whole thing in me , about other people , about the issues of the problems that has led me in the society that was just made in my 20s .
i 've been playing with my first woman in my first woman .
and for the age of six months , i 've got it back with her .
so that means we started a new relationship .
and because i have some of these whole bunch of <unk> and many other things that have changed .
i 've done a lot .
i 've started with my family in the <unk> .
so i work in my life today , i 'm telling you .
i 'm just looking at a <unk> <unk> .
you have to recognize that , you know , it 's very , very , many people have very , very , very , very much people who are actually actually , like , my mentor , are also over the mentor , and in fact , i do n't know about it , i do n't know , <unk> engagement from the time .
i 'm grateful that they 've got to the idea that they do .
i 'm grateful for you to have trouble with sure , and i 'm extremely grateful that i could be part of it .
of course , of course , the whole people who were support , they were involved .
i 've talked like a lot of people who were talking about the events , and i always <unk> it , and that 's okay .
and that 's why i 'm going to do it .
and tell you , thank you .
come in the prisons .
each of you have something we can need .
whether they were looking at our participants in their <unk> , whether they 're going to be as a <unk> of us , whether it 's in a financial support .
whether you want to carry our program in a new <unk> , very <unk> .
let 's talk to me .
martin poetry and i are today .
and look at the conversation with you .
thank you .
<unk> <unk> , i was <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal .
in a time i was <unk> at a time .
there you do things like that .
for <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the <unk> .
there are really a lot of opportunities to deal with <unk> .
you know , like you get around <unk> .
anyway , i was <unk> <unk> .
and my work with my work and so little <unk> .
so i have to talk about <unk> .
and not from real problems .
my problem was , i was <unk> , and i could be right as my life is going to look at 10 years , 30 years .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> , i found scary .
and to give up the <unk> .
in fact , i had an <unk> problem of crisis .
good like private .
i just did n't want to go to the <unk> journey ?
do you feel comfortable ?
or what if i throw my <unk> back to again ?
and look at what happens .
what you 're waiting for me .
that 's the idea .
i was in this time <unk> at a <unk> .
as i said , `` <unk> . ''
and the <unk> was also <unk> in the absolute life .
you <unk> the world for the world in very good hotels and <unk> the country in a very granular way .
but also , also , very <unk> countries .
and developing countries where there is more likely to see more than talking about <unk> villages with <unk> local local local people , even though they do n't have so much happiness and joy .
just from these images and <unk> lives , but a <unk> in a <unk> way .
and that was me for me for a while .
i was doing what i did .
down .
and also , i found a little bit of writing from me to write a country that i actually actually do n't really know .
i wanted to change .
i wanted to understand the countries .
and to write articles to write articles .
and to finish my personal interest .
how do you learn better ?
when you live with people .
people are living in you home .
not in the hotel .
by the challenges , with the challenges of people .
and by people , you work with people .
at least the answer i could give me on this question .
and that 's what i wanted to do .
and also , i wanted to do something wrong .
i wanted to afford a contribution .
something good .
and this kind of feeling has been <unk> at all of a <unk> .
i was now often in developing countries , but nepal is just touched me just a little bit .
until <unk> , there 's a <unk> civil war in which there 's not only one of the <unk> and social problems left .
with a year , one annual average of average of <unk> dollars is nepal in south asia .
and it 's still important to one of the two poorest countries of the world .
one quarter of the population lives below poverty .
almost a fifth of the population are suffering from malnutrition .
forty percent of the adults ca n't read and write .
all of these facts connected to a lot of personal stories , which i 've met in this journey in this journey i met in a time in a time in a time in a time i was ready and open to change .
in the same way i wanted to do something .
and for example , after my return of nepal , my decision , my decision .
i quit my job .
and i interviewed myself in the aid .
and i 'm also <unk> in a little bit of the answer , which i got to get my job .
because she was just a <unk> .
it 's about a serious idea of <unk> international 's international .
and not about a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> , the wait to live in nepal , and to look at a funding .
hello ?
is it ?
my job was really serious , and good .
at least , i thought that .
and these answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really <unk> .
and , of course , a very emotional answer .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
so instead , i took a little bit of intense feeling about what good <unk> .
i used it as a motor to give my own business .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
a company essentially basically what i 've been looking for .
which is the opportunity to travel differently differently .
the possibility of a country right right .
by the way that i live in the people , and work .
and that 's not going to work somewhere , but in <unk> <unk> .
you can dissect the way up with two words .
so , <unk> and <unk> .
so that means how much of the place you can gather good <unk> .
you can do a good thing .
this sounds like this sounds little bit more <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social business business .
we use tourism to be a tool for sustainable development .
we use a little bit more than a tool of sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and tourism .
because the people who travel with us .
they pay for their journey , how to another trial .
but they just travel .
they live in <unk> .
and the idea is not a lot of recovery or more <unk> , but real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
and we 've been engaged in the participants in some <unk> and interests in different projects .
we can have an <unk> <unk> in the world in areas that otherwise ca n't have a chance of <unk> tourism .
because the infrastructure is missing to it .
we can promote sustainable projects .
we can <unk> our sustainable projects and finance .
so we 're providing a hundred percent of ourselves .
they do n't rely on donations .
and that 's just for our long-term <unk> engagement .
we started <unk> with our work in nepal .
we 've got our engagement in uganda <unk> .
and over over four years , i turned to get married , and my husband and i are a <unk> question .
let 's go to the <unk> way ?
or what would we think more .
when we do n't think about the <unk> ?
if we do n't have social engagement and sustainable travel , and development in its wholeness ?
and also the individual <unk> ?
or even other individual <unk> <unk> .
that would be a new company .
a company , which is <unk> .
but with other things , the same philosophy like <unk> .
do we want this ?
was the next question .
<unk> new companies ?
we want that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're just <unk> .
because we talk the same language .
because we dream the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and that 's why we have an sister given a sister .
<unk> .
and with <unk> , we promote a creative company in their development and <unk> <unk> that we support through extraordinary people .
and with some of the participants , governments , entrepreneurs or collaborator from creative companies with individual development goals .
so the personal social and <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> .
and they 're going to prepare for the <unk> .
there are also <unk> in <unk> .
one aid of a meaningful <unk> still has another advantage .
he 's looking at a long time in where you are , or where you <unk> .
where you might have a <unk> biases .
where you might have a little bit more flexible , you know , to think .
and he 's showing you what you 're really good .
it leads to its strength .
it 's the creativity that all is great , great .
or it 's the equanimity that you find new into it .
the <unk> things do n't make you not change .
and the power to change things you can change .
and you can change very much .
in very short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are <unk> rose <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
these are five wonderful women from uganda .
<unk> , and with talent .
they put beautiful beautiful , <unk> <unk> .
and we did n't have happened for years .
because they did n't have a market .
because they did n't know how to improve quality .
because nobody said , which is the design of the question .
we wanted to help these women .
and that 's why in this year , also a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products from poverty .
you give you a income .
one future .
we went yesterday with our <unk> live .
and we start with a <unk> <unk> .
one <unk> <unk> of a thousand <unk> of our women .
<unk> is not just a year for a year .
it also allows us to make a lot larger .
this first <unk> is kind of social space <unk> and <unk> .
so who wants to support , you can do it with a tax of a chain , but you can also travel to us directly to the project .
he can travel and travel to the women .
we do n't want to have a long term , we do n't want to give five women 's work , or by a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but in nepal , and in other <unk> , in which we work <unk> .
but that <unk> is just a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we work in all the central areas .
in the realm of <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work is in just a area too .
what happens to the children when women work ?
right .
so we started in nepal and in uganda and in uganda <unk> two <unk> centre .
it 's all in our cycle .
and all of the power is more sense than every single project .
suppose we 're going to place the <unk> in the different projects .
and then they 're going to get a little bit of opportunities in the common work .
and finally , i want to take a journey on a journey .
and i 'm going to close your eyes .
reset you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're on a wooden dining room .
and they 're happy and tired .
you 've just stopped with your <unk> .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
there 's plenty of warm .
you <unk> the window .
and they 're looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand .
you <unk> your <unk> .
also , there 's a thin layer of the <unk> .
the kids laughing .
and i call your <unk> .
you 're not going to call you a little bit more <unk> .
<unk> .
you do n't know how late it is .
but soon , you 'll get up .
and the <unk> , on the moment , the kids were going on , <unk> .
at the end of the street , a big tree .
here you 're going to meet you with <unk> .
in the developmental <unk> , you 'll get the new designs of their <unk> .
what are you going to talk to hands and feet .
later , the other women come to .
they smile you .
until you talk to your english language .
under the tree .
free .
remarkably , there 's the internet .
tomorrow 's <unk> with your coach .
you 're going to get you .
exchange is valuable .
it 's also nice to talk about german .
you <unk> music .
and the <unk> of <unk> .
mama <unk> <unk> <unk> in the courtyard .
she sings a african song .
you 're a <unk> and happy .
you can do the eyes .
each of us can meet the <unk> in a new context .
or at least , at least a short time , the cube is going to be new .
and you see what happens .
thank you .
before i start , i would have interested in whether it 's the night that you 're there , someone who has been working on it .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i 'm not going to do that light right now , but maybe somebody wants to be your hand .
here 's the bottom of the <unk> .
two .
now , here 's <unk> , i do n't know , but in every case there is two , which is beautiful , we 've already <unk> .
and i 've also drawn a building , and that 's the <unk> mountain in the east of the city .
that 's the building .
and with six people i 've been working on , i 've been working on the last summer age six months .
and so i 'm telling you tonight .
well , you might say some of you .
what is it ?
<unk> are a lot .
but i want to explain .
oh , what 's the <unk> now ?
and the <unk> in park or how ?
just one little selection of the questions that we have known , who have been trying to learn how to learn how to learn that i 'm part of a initiative i 've got to deal with a initiative that i 'm going to give up with a initiative i 've got to say , <unk> , <unk> .
and all of the time we got into the series of <unk> <unk> .
and here 's about these <unk> <unk> built , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and the privatization of the privatization of it looks like this .
but who knows , that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was not the elected <unk> of the initiative .
what we see here is a plaque from the <unk> in <unk> .
this is a public space , which is private , and that 's why for many people , i do n't say , `` you do n't say , but not in public hand , and that 's why it can not be used in public spaces .
we were a group of <unk> in the desire with <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell another <unk> .
we were a <unk> team , and i have to find a little bit of , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the fields of architecture , urban social , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography , <unk> and <unk> .
of course , with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspective and <unk> .
and we have allowed us to create different capabilities , but also in different networks .
and a creative part of <unk> solutions in the <unk> , which we have done is that we did .
we have actually navigated to <unk> the <unk> .
however , it was about the <unk> of the stories and ideas .
and we asked these memories and images .
and from these memories and images , it 's trying to provide possible perspectives for the <unk> .
it was really important to us that the process continues to be constructive .
and we have an initiative that we have to have a <unk> tool , and as a <unk> .
this was a <unk> and emotional <unk> and became a <unk> .
on the experiences we 've done , i 'm going to talk about it tonight .
every city has grown places .
there 's a face .
in many cases , these were <unk> and <unk> , and they 're seeing in the consequences of citizens as foreign places .
they 're the dead places of a city because they do n't find a lot of the way that we expect in a public space .
so for example , for example , we have <unk> , <unk> .
they 're going to get these , but also the actually public debate , is often <unk> .
initiatives that want to be <unk> these places , often often <unk> interest in the infancy .
now , what did it have to do with me , like some questions , i like some other questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places are not just a face .
no .
they 're the social places of our city , in the <unk> lives .
and so we 're going to do a lot of the first <unk> ties in our neighbors , when we 're going to go to the way .
and can this fit , when we have a serious way to sit , and in fact , in fact , when the spaces are also designed to the spaces .
and we 're just getting more interested in the way .
it 's related to each other , sometimes .
but that 's a feeling of community .
now , the more part of the things i 've got in such a public space , the faster and the more , it 's also these community .
and if i 'm not <unk> , you see what you might call the intention of a big city .
we were two challenges ago .
we can get in the citizens of consciousness , responsibility , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood or <unk> in <unk> .
how is the mint going to be transformed ?
how can anyone be transformed in ideas ?
protest against the privatization and <unk> of these <unk> places , and the <unk> against the scale , and actually not necessarily be able to do the same places .
so imagine you 're sitting here , you 're sitting here , once you beat the newspaper and read next text .
love <unk> and citizens , we invite you to give you a three potential varieties for the <unk> of the <unk> , which is called <unk> <unk> .
you 're allowed to skip the idea of the idea .
and the alternative to most of the <unk> is then <unk> .
would you go ?
would anyone come to this event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds just great .
there 's a little bit more possibility .
you 're allowed to <unk> how this looks like in the future .
and as i said , it sounds great for the first moment .
i think of a explanation .
and that 's because i 'm not allowed to be involved in the way , or choose or accountability , <unk> .
first , it 's a lot of <unk> <unk> too late .
now , mostly , they do n't have a opportunity to make a opportunity , really , to make a little bit of ideas , or the basic alternative , but there 's actually a piece of design , and they 're not going to decide whether they 're still <unk> or <unk> in the urban environments .
or , as a friend recently said , which is the color is the trash of the trash .
second explanation <unk> <unk> is rarely over information and voting .
think about three <unk> varieties .
so we have what we want to show you , and you can give them to be able to vote .
frustration and <unk> are often the consequences of what i find out .
i do n't want to make a decision about <unk> or <unk> , if i actually had a <unk> , rather than <unk> <unk> .
but it 's also different .
even though , the <unk> of the people who have spent a lot of talk about , we have to have a lot of <unk> .
and that 's how we took these experiences and i want to share with another <unk> .
i 'd like to share it to other <unk> , other projects , but of all the city city and policy .
because these are the ones that are actually going to have these <unk> and actually actually are responsible for these processes .
and so , when it 's really interested in a participation , how many , is so often <unk> and <unk> , we need and then we need to have new <unk> .
but not last , but i 'm also telling me all of you who are sitting here .
and that 's why i think of very important .
i 'm going to do it for important that they all go , and i want to encourage you with our example , to give you a chance to give a chance .
and i connect them all of them because they 're the ones who are having a new <unk> <unk> .
so we need to look at the ability to look at the betterment , to the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and <unk> ?
first of the <unk> , for the dialogue .
in <unk> , professionals , citizens , citizens to <unk> and different interests .
now , what we see here is a certain kind of birth to give us a spot .
what we see here is some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal has to be that all of these conversations are on <unk> , so that they do n't have the <unk> interests or the <unk> capabilities , or the <unk> capabilities of the capabilities of the citizens .
the citizens of place in place are experts , they 're experts for their neighborhood they know , what they 're missing with you , which is a place where tradition is a place , and also , what they 're missing .
the <unk> , especially in the city , what 's going to be in the project .
in the ignored or in a particular case , then there 's another case in a particular case , the issues of a <unk> that are only available to the project , after .
and that 's all the things that leads to a <unk> , where all the information can be accessible and then the place can make .
and by trying to get upright , which is going to get an identification of the place .
a vote on <unk> means also is that the wish of the <unk> are actually <unk> .
and then , when someone says i want to say , `` i want to have a <unk> . ''
and of course , of course , of course , that can be <unk> , but the target needs to be in <unk> with all right , which is the right solution , and perhaps in the <unk> , then
as i said , it 's got to get out of the dialogue .
second point are different crochet clips .
our <unk> is colorful .
one feels very comfortable by being aware of a great group of great group and talk .
another one can write good , but then you do n't want to talk about the text .
another , maybe one of them might rather be <unk> or photographed .
or create a ideas in <unk> <unk> .
what i want to say is to say it has to be able to give it different ways to get different user levels .
for example , we 've got to get the opportunity to get out , just looking at what happens .
in the background , little exhibition .
we have the opportunity to give up <unk> .
we 've had the opportunity to paint .
we have the opportunity to write .
regardless of age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the opportunity to connect our ideas to connect ideas .
also , the way to provide outside of <unk> <unk> should be given .
for example , this can happen for a <unk> , which can happen about <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> and transparent availability of the results of the results of the results of the results .
we have the whole process of parallel with facebook , and in a little bit of <unk> and independent <unk> in the same time .
the third point of <unk> .
you may remember remember that i said that <unk> often is too late .
in my <unk> event , there was three finished <unk> .
now , <unk> is the process , and then it 's going to be happening , and the alternative in your own self does n't know what 's going to happen to <unk> area .
if you get through the dialogue , and i 'm going to talk to the point of one , which is where scenarios is going to be in a area .
and by the way , by the way , also , by the way , to the <unk> itself .
and then , when not , if not the beginning to be presented in the beginning is that the <unk> event is so much and so looking at the experiences of the previous experience .
now , what 's happening now , if citizens <unk> their city and their city .
it 's already in many projects .
i have an example from <unk> , which is the <unk> , probably known for many .
in new york , a project , it 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> , there 's been <unk> dollars in six weeks to be able to be able to be done or at least <unk> .
the time has been written in august , the political could not be different than to make the idea of doing it .
and the <unk> in new york , to say , to say , i do n't have to say , because he has become one of the most important <unk> of the city or the political administration .
in the opposite , the <unk> of the <unk> , stood in the <unk> .
in <unk> , we 're back in germany , in germany , the citizens have already been <unk> plans to <unk> it again .
the city had said , `` well , '' was n't going to be <unk> .
the four weeks of <unk> that we have for <unk> <unk> , who are <unk> .
today 's the city of the city <unk> <unk> .
and while the side of <unk> d , it 's wonderful , and the city of the <unk> who started studying the initiative .
in other words , citizens ' citizens who are attracted to the street .
in rotterdam , a <unk> <unk> had been <unk> .
all so far , you want to say .
and then we 're just going to do that way .
but i think it 's wrong , the city of responsibility .
why ?
one because you have a look at all of you or have a look .
and while the <unk> , it 's <unk> and companies to focus on the rule of them in a form of information , the city of the projects that are responsible for the attention .
and for other , of course , as the city has a projects , other , other means .
a <unk> initiative can be just <unk> .
and our goal has been a temporary initiative to <unk> a year , about a year of work with the results and the responsibility to the city .
model is a <unk> in january <unk> in january .
it 's still running more conservative .
that 's why we have the problem that we could n't be the responsibility for the moment .
but we know , now , now , if the city has been successful in the <unk> , if they 're in the negotiations that they 're actually going to be done , that then , a <unk> is going to happen .
in which form is actually open .
so to conclude , i 'm convinced that many projects , which is , because of their meaning , complexity or your cost of the city have been developed , and they have to create a chance to create a chance of <unk> and identification .
when you 're just in time and all of the citizens ,
in a city and citizens .
in a city , and all you guys are sitting here tonight .
when we do our jobs , and in the same time , the makers of the physician are not to perceive the <unk> of the citizens of citizens , but as a <unk> .
that 's it .
yesterday , the <unk> night , we were there in <unk> in the <unk> , and there 's the <unk> .
we talked about <unk> .
so this idea is , a lot of second chance , if it did n't work in this life , just as a second chance .
and we found something exciting .
and we were very quickly that there are two things that there are two things that we did n't want to see .
one is john .
the second one was in the school , at the end of school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you might remember , you might remember <unk> <unk> .
i mean , i 'm so , it 's now , it 's <unk> years ago , but the words are going to leave me to <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> together , and i just want to leave back to it .
and then i do n't know how it was in my exams , and then it was the <unk> of the <unk> , who was going to be in my <unk> .
no idea what has become actually .
they 're going to understand it , so my school , my school , i was really beautiful and after i had my last <unk> of mine , never quite clear , never again .
and what i 'm going to say , if i look at the year , some of the nicest days i spent there in schools .
there 's a lot of <unk> and completely voluntary .
how did it be ?
how could this happen ?
and i first started that , which is something that happened to what i could n't have to do .
i got kids .
so my wife got the kids .
and that was also clear that they had one that had to deal with this <unk> .
until a day when she said , `` honey , it 's <unk> .
and then you leave .
yes , <unk> .
and i opened the door , and then i sat in this <unk> and <unk> , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
that 's exactly what we looked at this time .
and that 's also the <unk> , as a <unk> , and i was <unk> , and i was able to <unk> me , human being really changed .
and when i heard the teacher , and you know , the kids do n't learn for school , but for it , i mean , my god , i would say , `` oh , '' i did n't have a <unk> .
what is what we have from school , from this school high school , really , in fact ?
so many of us have been able to learn the right thing .
where do you have a real job in your life , right ?
and maybe some of you might know how the capital was <unk> .
what is the end of the rest of it ?
or <unk> , this ability to have a lot of time in a lot of time in a long time , only to <unk> it , and so i put it out to a <unk> .
well , i needed to have the <unk> for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what does a <unk> point of one point of one point of something that 's going to be a good doctor ?
whether the <unk> is , and whether it 's the good response of documents ?
no way .
so , no way to live for it , not for school we learn .
now , when we look like this , so about <unk> years , the <unk> century , that might be a <unk> .
this is the time in germany , which was actually launched in germany .
and where the school school system , how we 've got it today , the roots .
and if we imagine the time we had , in fact , the people had no access to the knowledge of the time .
and there were these four or six years they were used to go to school and have been <unk> , then they were really the only opportunity to come to the knowledge and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information and the information .
today , a <unk> more information in its pocket and the largest library of the time .
and the middle century , that was the time of the <unk> .
so that means there 's a lot of change in the world and all of all people had to provide these new machines .
but at the same time , but also , people needed to wait that machines could wait and repair .
and we needed people who could build these machines , and they were doing these factories .
you might recognize it .
the <unk> school system that we have today is in germany today , has its root in this time .
and there 's probably done there .
but also , because it was probably the way that i 've been learned in school for the work for the assembly line , which is the line of the assembly line , who stood in .
let 's look at the future .
let 's see the <unk> century , where it 's , and let 's look at the year .
the year , the year was there , the first <unk> was just going to be in <unk> .
i was done with my study , and i thought , now the point is now , you 're going to make you direct , the first company .
yeah , after some of the internet , i got out of the internet , and then i <unk> , i 'm going to pass this .
and some of these companies are <unk> and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger , and some of the companies are then in the <unk> .
you see two times in life .
and we had 30 years , and then we had 30 employees .
so , we had a beautiful growth , and we had so exciting professions , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if you have a sophisticated concrete idea , what these people are doing , but when i was in school , we had no idea that it would ever been .
even when i was <unk> , i was n't talking about the internet .
and the kids that are going to send in school today , which are going to be the job in 10 , six , six or 30 years ?
the only honest answer , we have no idea .
and what do you know what facts are going to need to be successful in this future jobs ?
and when you 're honest , the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're in the future , we 're looking at the future , because the <unk> for the morning .
there 's <unk> <unk> , i read .
well , you see , you do n't know .
how do we get out of how high school are learning ?
what are the things we need to make kids fit to life ?
and maybe it 's a look at what companies are looking for employees .
that 's the <unk> of school , yes ?
the alumni of schools and universities are coming into companies .
and when you look at a very serious classic <unk> , then there 's first thing , what the expertise .
and there 's what you want to do , so you want to read the reading , we 're looking at <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we 're going to look at 10 years in the age .
it 's not going to be done in the future .
now , what you could afford , is the things that are always important , these are the so-called <unk> <unk> , and i 'm sure that these <unk> <unk> will be the <unk> of the future of the future .
and the principle in three groups .
so this is one , companies wish to kill employees , the flexible , so is that one .
and then almost all the companies want to think of employees with <unk> .
and then these businesses are <unk> who are <unk> .
so we 've got <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
let 's start with the flexibility .
that 's relatively fast .
if we look at how economy is working , how fast we change .
<unk> , all the business models are going to be <unk> from the internet .
there 's a thousand workers who can handle this change .
and i need to provide people who are creative .
there 's the <unk> who are <unk> .
this is quite the opposite of the <unk> in the factory of the <unk> of employees .
and the second subject is the entrepreneurial <unk> think is relatively clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's about people who are stewardship .
first of all , and her own life .
but also , the big whole .
whether this is the company or also as a society we want to give us the responsibility for the great whole .
and the third factor , the <unk> , which is going to be almost a lot of most common .
and if we remember the football , then there was there in the internet , there was this beautiful adage .
argentina had <unk> <unk> <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't <unk> <unk> who won the <unk> .
and that could be the only thing together .
and as someone , this big innovator of our time , steve jobs , yes .
it was n't the guy who invented the iphone , who did n't invented the <unk> , who did n't invented the itunes , which has invented nothing .
the team , had a team that has done that , because of the team , they could do what they 've done .
so high school , who could convey these three things in the ground , but that 's a lot of school in which we learn for it .
but there 's still a lot of fourth point , and that 's almost more important .
and this is learning themselves .
if the only thing we can tell you about the future with the future is that you 're not going to learn the ability to learn new and things to learn new and fun to experience that learning experiments in the future life , and that our children are successful in the future life .
but this is a little bit of school , which is the idea of these things .
but where was i ?
i sat in this <unk> and the ones who have the kids who know that it 's not just a serious event , to pay for you .
so this is a serious event for the motto , but there 's not not about each other .
until the point of the time , where the <unk> , there 's all invisible .
well , i sat there and what should i say , the <unk> of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest pieces of event .
less fun , it was for me as a father when the stress about <unk> and learning the entire family life .
and less fun is , when the child is sick , because in school .
and finally , this <unk> did n't end up and was a peak of this <unk> <unk> .
it was not a <unk> kid , it was like a <unk> , so on the last hour , and in fact , we were also the only parents who have been invited .
and i 'm telling you , and i 'm telling me the details of the day , which is clear , we have to have our child to be there .
but two years , but two years , where we have , there is something that does n't work .
what do we do wrong ?
and we had the question , we had broken our child ?
and are we the only one that it is ?
now , i 've been talking about the last two years , since i 've spoken in the subject of a lot of people , and i realized i 've learned to do it .
there 's a lot of them who are very similar , and this was two years ago , and i sat down with <unk> <unk> , a new company , the day we 've been thinking about where the journey is going to go , and we sat down to the bar , and we sat in the bar , and we sat in the bar , and we sat in the bar and have been
and what should i say , he 's almost the same story telling me with one of his kids , he 's almost the same story , and we had the fortune that we could take our children from school , yes ?
in berlin , there 's a lot of <unk> in different schools and we could even consider any private schools .
but can everyone do out there ?
somehow , it was too little , just our children in safety , and these <unk> would be so much like them .
and after all of the idea now , for school , for school , we have n't really changed so right there , well , we 've got the first thing that we have now .
just , how are we going to change something like this ?
the good news is we deceived us .
we are not alone .
but we 've found relatively very quickly in a range of great people who wanted to do , which is , which is a <unk> school , which is all of the needs .
it 's not so much that the kids and their parents are under the suffering , which is happening out there .
when we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
when we look at a look at how the number of <unk> <unk> has changed in the last 10 years .
so can it be that all parents are doing something wrong ?
that all the kids are locked and that teachers are broken ?
or can it be that we have a school system , which is just not so much like this <unk> years , which just does n't fit so right .
and we found a lot of people who were similar and we found people who have no kids .
and they understood that they have to take responsibility for the future that they have to take responsibility for the future , by taking responsibility for the future , and the kids now go to school in school .
and we have a lot of <unk> second , there 's a lot of great document there , and there 's a lot of schools , there are <unk> schools , and there 's really great <unk> and there 's almost seven school teachers who are really dedicated and
and there 's even a or other <unk> , which is also <unk> the first step .
and how should we help ?
we did n't have a concept that we could do with help .
but we can do one thing , we can go in these schools and we can come in these schools , the people who are school , so the parents and students , the teachers and students , and we can make a lot of work in two days .
so there are people who have been working together in the past , that worked at the past more so much more and learning to two days .
this is where there 's a lot of concrete challenge to solve them together .
and after two , so , for example , this is a new <unk> of new school , or given the <unk> of a new school in high school as we 're going to be playing with a berlin school .
or they have concrete things for <unk> problems they have in their school .
within two days , developed the next day , right ?
but what 's the world is what happens to these two days , and it makes it so nice to me that i 've been doing , and then i 've got to spend the schools in a high school , that 's the energy that 's going to learn
when the three things are in common in common , which is what <unk> <unk> .
so , like , <unk> , and if you experience a team .
then that 's a <unk> , the <unk> .
and if we had four weeks to go to this , and then we 're going to experience that school in school as a whole started to change that there 's a whole new culture .
and this is incredibly <unk> .
and i invite you to think about school .
i invite you to think about school .
and i 'm <unk> in all , too far , about school , talking about school .
talk about what you do , but you do n't like you what you do .
you 're going to be surprised how much <unk> they get and how many people have experienced the same thing , but simply not just talk about .
let 's give us every single school in germany in the <unk> century .
let 's change the entire education system .
and let 's do this together with the people with the school of school , the parents , the teachers and students .
because we can do this together .
thank you .
