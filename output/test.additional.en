as steve 2000 the los cotton times , one day by partners , he heard i heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a filmmaker i are <unk> the <unk> the ceiling i who had i see in 's a donation is just two money of the time .
many of them are going a story the story , because of the <unk> coast of this was been
and
i 'm up to read you to read the
i met brian
he just see a picture of <unk> first and the under i 've only sure of the stage , and come difficult a stage . that 's going i think that . .
he talked about a very <unk> ,
we came to talk to a stem set , of a him between care , and i got a email in the state of the state in the state that 's
i have to say that <unk> was a medical treatment , because he was in and
so as i 'm going it to be vulnerable i 'm going to be vulnerable a lot of <unk> , and they 're so bad , and he looked '' in the streets of the
and in exactly to the use that we really better started a first thing you started a first thing they started in the former musician in the roofs in the former attracted in to the front musician i had to world they then
he talked about invisible houses and smoke and how i four a little used to do .
i had fear , but i had fear that i could lose him in if i could get came out in like that in if it could continues to have the relationship can destroy the balloon i started to do , of course ,
so i just started to play .
i played to the first sentence by
and while i played , i noticed in the
it was when he stood under the impact of a invisible quality that -- a chemical response , to as a game . and that -- is from my game .
and
and like a miracle he took say and better , a thing a little bit that i was wanted it to play , of course , and then asked them a little data , ``
we started talking about music , and 's starting i started talking about it kind that began it over time the want a different
and i realized that he did n't just have it
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that it 's just about my colleagues in the <unk> of the
by writing set and <unk> i was talking about this <unk> the <unk> , a times , their . <unk> a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in
music is medicine . music changes us .
for <unk> , music means <unk> health .
because the music allows him to him , of his solid and access it about say and creates creativity in something good and creativity .
and so he 's going to get his <unk> cell . and it 's going it
i understood in fact that this is the creatures of art .
this is the reason we make set of open , so 's what we 're going to do , we have something that we have in the inner way i ? . and our arrived , through our artistic system i as the beauty of the actual creates . of the reality .
and the reality of the thing in which this is going i got a lot is to us and go you , ahead and open us .
what 's going to do this is the care of music , of to the keep the care of friends .
the <unk> force of music took him back to a family of musicians that realized looking 're got say of say of to a doubt of his puzzles of the talent and him of .
and i 'm going to go up as a
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gates .
robert gates : i want to play something that i have
i hope you hate me .
so i 've seen it you in from my life in from my life .
i 've or just two .
this first , that was more like a boring system .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good with <unk> to the
what a fish .
even better to get in and
so you could feel like to secret him .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several happening .
one day , the boss was the somebody who was going it to be on a event , and if so it could be on it for a event of to the farm .
`` of course , ''
here was a company that tried to solve what this kind you 've right this is for out of our current ago and going to do in when we put fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the eight years that so we 've right an economy you on harder . and we with the ocean of the world in the last 50 years
it 's hard to make destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> and
it 's almost nothing . and it 's not a left in .
so if this is going a lot of ,
many of to us the environment , the environment that most of you -- and they 're inefficient , we take a form you . i had a big disadvantage .
he has an
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are needed to get i a pounds of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
not very good .
so here was finally a company that tried to do it right .
i wanted to choose we had it and i four . .
at to to the day , i call the boss for to the <unk> of to the company .
we call him
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` just to have the facts , you '' are tree to grow how far in the sea , that your environment do there people do there .
`` this this is , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste of when we 're going to get on when we are
and then he did , 're basically a own world .
these
`` the best in the industry .
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> , what all you n't ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great '' i said .
and at this dramatic time to the truly night and again , what is a sustainable hate ?
so i called to the technology , short of it the event the event .
i said , `` well the
he said , he does n't . he 's going to be able a lot .
now , i 'm going to have a few people in the company . nobody could give me a <unk> answer , until i finally <unk> with the <unk> biologists .
we also call it <unk> and <unk> .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` what are sustainable proteins ?
well the
i said ``
he said , `` yeah , <unk> , <unk> to
i said , `` how much percent of the <unk> is chicken ?
in the assumption , maybe little percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` hey , what is win about to be . these are the unknown in fish ?
there were a long focus about a moment , of course , he said , `` there 's just too much stuck on the world .
i 'm going to get out of this fish .
no , not because i 'm a <unk> and
that 's what i am .
no , i actually have <unk> <unk> by they
this second fish , that 's a different kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic kind of kind of kind of kind that you know , the better you learn the asking , you know , the asking the fish .
i 've got him in i had a essential in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> company had been talking about this fish .
it 's kind of <unk> and
he came on the table with a <unk> the
the chef had <unk> him .
wait twice .
nevertheless to as we was .
who can be a asking so good after he was going a <unk> n't ?
i ca n't , but this guy can it .
we call looking miguel . in idea he is juan of .
and no , he does n't have the fish and he 's not a chef . at least the way that is and i understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la la <unk> and <unk> .
this is an
it 's near to
in to the <unk> , the farm was in the hands of the
they 're describing
they did this me me by a food .
they built these complicated consequence of the u.s. a lot is , and they 're <unk> long from the country . .
now , they could n't make that it -- not economically .
and <unk> was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the nation to be about what lot of the
and so , in fact to be a photographed company about the country .
what did they do ?
they 're going a river of water .
they literally have the amp in <unk> that . that 's what for the balkans in . and they 're up that
instead of the water , they used the channels of to the waves that
they were
they built we on i third , . it --
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they never saw this . .
they 're going to go out to the horizon , which this is a million miles away the way , and all what they 're seeing are
i was n't a long time with juan .
he 's a fantastic hand , three parts charles darwin and a part of the <unk> .
okay ? there are , in fact the <unk> and i <unk> you and
here he does a agreed .
now he mentioned the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> that
and here , here he looks a pattern of the <unk> in the
it turns out that miguel has been the biggest part of his career in the <unk> u.s. national park of africa and in africa .
i asked him how he has been a . .
he said , `` fish ? i know nothing about fish .
i 'm i i 'm a horse what i 'm going to do .
and then he goes up of <unk> dr. <unk> that
and understand not huge , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community of
it 's great , but i was love .
and my head was going a lot of the
so i did there and said , `` miguel , how does it get the stand so good ?
he showed up the algae and he showed .
`` i know boy , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships , that 's incredible .
but what do you pay your color ?
how is the <unk> ?
now , he 's going to go to made that it 's so it so a
the <unk> gravitational shows the
the system is so healthy , it 's totally
there 's no food .
the one of a agree that do n't get get their animals ?
later , at the day , i went around the day about miguel and i said , `` for a place that seems to be like of course , as a farm that i had are , `` how do you have success ?
in the moment , it was like i had a <unk> of i do a
and we <unk> i was to see i was in it , and we have a lot of the <unk> , thousands of
`` that 's models '' he said .
`` look at their
they 're <unk> and .
``
i said , `` miguel , do n't you do your fish ?
`` yeah , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> on to to
now , last year , on this piece of <unk> birds , more than 250 different kinds of species .
it 's the largest and one of the most important private <unk> in europe . .
i said , `` miguel , is a great
he 's going to take got his head , no .
he said , `` we build a
this is an
the gods pay the turtle of the sky that .
and to make to something to something is up of to to make i think of it and . and
so the <unk> of the <unk> , the better . ''
okay , let 's rethink that and a agree that they do n't see of the animals and a farm that 's going to be the mass in the child of the child .
one
oh , and the way to do at the way , these fears in
they 're going to come use in a city , will where i 'm going to get a
they democracy how we 're
and every night , they fly back to 50 everyday .
they do that out because they can follow the <unk> white line of <unk>
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at all and looked now that
i said , `` miguel , go a
do you do that for children ?
he looked at me as a son that it was a goal of canada that i 've right n't that . that so
he said , `` no . you do that because the food is better .
i did n't have the skin of my father -- and it was no
it 's the
i never do so .
and yet , when i decided a records in this restaurant in
they were cute , of course , as if you take a <unk> or the ocean .
i mentioned that you '' and just <unk> of the edge in the front is .
he said , `` the skin works now like a deserts .
it 's the last hamburger before something in the body .
they developed in to evolution in begin i have to get
and then he said , `` but our water has no <unk> .
okay . a farm that do there -- a farm that 's going to be a farm that 's going to be on their models . and the models of their own success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no <unk> , and it so
it 's a river that allows all the things to come these days that we tend it to lead to us to make temperature , temperature that are <unk> from
and when we what it was designed know , and this chart this is the water . of a way in to the real way and going it .
the system is so healthy , it feeds i all many long .
so not just a farm that are not going it , not just a farm that 's going to be a farm on to the single success of the child , but a farm that 's literally a <unk> , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because when the real water <unk> a <unk> the water . .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i want i to ? because he 's space , and are country , as well not that of . and it 's also . that 's also
you could say that it so a recipe is a recipe have good second for i talk to
what we need is now this is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one of the food you '' you 're up . of the food
but for many people , it 's a little bit to radical .
we 're not <unk> the <unk> of actually the
we love <unk> . we love small
and if you say that the things are the things that you 're going to tell for the future of the future , and says , `` hey people , i love the
how are they going a world n't ?
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we 're going to make enough calories to feed the world more than just . of the world .
one billion people are going a lot of people .
one billion -- that 's more than the before the
now , i do n't like this question because they have the logic of our own
<unk> grain in
that are to
we should call them what she this is , a <unk> in the
this is not the ground , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk>
not through the newest
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that make every community to feed itself ?
to do that , look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in
so let 's look at the biodiversity model .
this is the thing that 's going to be
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses , who -- they these everyday worlds are willing a lot of <unk> of
because they are the ones who are the forced to taste that --
and if i really 'm honest , you 're a better chef because i 'm more . .
you know , that 's right , because if the interesting food is good , it things well social and it so .
thank you .
if i want to share one back to you today is that the data of women we consume is which we 're going to have to would think of the sum of their decisions of to think that we can would think about how we can would think about how we can think that crisis i things <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
so what we see here is a typical . .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it 's
and immediately , i see a different pattern that ! .
and because in the <unk> of the people who are at a
we can go back a map of came up in and see the data and see that the
now if we go back of the time that we go to line that we see hundred years or younger , we see that tumors for to be to the
and who 's going to see that this is especially in men .
so you who see in the way of information and data in this way , very quickly in a boring .
and if we do this have to do why do n't do does why do there for content ?
now what we have here is the <unk> of the <unk>
it 's all here and it 's all online .
you can like a talk to my talk to my talk . .
they be able to be able a decade in a decade
they be course in a particular year .
you can jump speech i can jump on like it . and you be able to do we be course . .
now if i look at this , i see the tumor that appear is in this copy and the <unk> and the <unk> .
i 'm i like it , it -- so it 's going to get out to as 's up to me , and i 'm going to get out i 've right to show at at least it
now , if i want to get an
so i go back to and
now i see greg .
and so you get a idea of that like is that like is <unk> the way , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> and
you do something that actually is a little bit different .
it 's something between and we think it changes the way that we be used to be used .
i want to go to do i make a little bit about about what a little bit crazy .
what we did here is , 's going to take every single <unk> , that we have to get we to get it on a little bit . .
and to be i just percent in a fear and a symbol for the area of it dollars .
i just show the top 500 of <unk>
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
and then so we get a sense of the kinds that are the
i 'm going to choose the theme of the
now , big , i know , i know , i think that a
this is really important , because this is a realization that does n't have a difference in it . .
and that are just to see if you look at a step and look at the whole thing .
and
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are <unk> . some of the science . into ♫ some , less the <unk> i come from the economy . here was my boss .
and interestingly , sadly , a amazing phenomenon they my own .
so we can look like , of course , and you can look at all the amazing of to the ted guy .
you see , we 're going to get to has to get a net as if it 's actually we 've been i a net , not just from side of side , but much more important and more . .
and so i want to show you what else could be a little surprise .
i just show you just the new york times website .
and
so i can go back to go back , of a certain
so that 's so course , how you just look at the look at websites in this kind of way the did the children can also look at the same way of to to look at the same way .
so i can look '' in my point you can go you is you in a certain time .
here 's the whole demonstration of the demonstration you 've been going a way .
and i can look 're all what i saw today .
and if i look at a step back and look at all , i can see my attention it in just my <unk> to from from my <unk> and here , i 've been came it to <unk> , and here and were going i 'm here to live in the lives and then
and from here , it be able to get into the side of to the side and they '' important and again and again .
it 's a metaphor that 's always used again , and every time it makes the network larger two than the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , we think that data are a curse .
we 're talking about the curse of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 're talking about the
what if we could go out in the head and ask the internet to go to the head of to go to the want to go to many well , a lot of things to go to many things , and the international pattern of what could as is on i ?
if we can do this , it things get
and , instead of going a simple way to move in information , we can know that . of it .
and if we know , we can even take think in the way .
so i hear , should thank you very much .
i grew up with an
in my time , i went to the bus to school , every day a hour . .
and my nose had been in i a book , an
and these curiosity showed that we were in school , and
i was totally
it was space to understand the world and the limits of the kinds of . .
and my love of science fiction seemed to be seemed i seemed a lot in my environment , because in the late '60s , we went to the moon , of the ground in to the moon .
<unk> 2 came in our living room with his fascinating shows this art and places and a world full of wonders that we never had to imagine .
so that so , so a ; this for the <unk> . .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there are no inside of the
and we see all the where we were going i had to have a book , we took the description of the <unk> of to the <unk> and <unk> think that in how to the screen .
my response to this was the
in the process , i was going a lot that i was going a teacher i was looking '' you think ,
the creativity had to go up .
and this imagine first interesting . on the <unk> of
certainly i would went to do i have a <unk> some of the world with a spaceship . it notion . .
but here 's a world that i could actually come in the okay the earth , and she was so fascinating and <unk> more now like all that we had been reading to them .
so i decided to be 15 to as a 15 ,
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , one more worlds that are the bit of the next ocean .
but i did n't get the of think that i do there .
i 'm going to get my father to the
i made my favorite <unk> is in a pool of the middle in to
but the ocean , the ocean , i 've only got two years later to the built , when so we went i to despite california .
since , in the 40 years , the <unk> , i 've spent about three hours of water . 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of to the united family , even in the <unk> oceans , as larger in to <unk> far , as was we then able i can do it .
the relationship you think of nature does n't know borders , in our might be able to make to because in when we do n't with because that 's the most of a human creation .
now the days of the business the days , we 're going to see what 's going to see in these
and my love to to to to the ocean , about the same intensity of the same time and the same .
when i was i like it as a adult
that seemed the best possibility to tell my inner sense , about my need to create pictures .
and as a child , i did n't make so
so movies were the did and
of course , the stories i had
in
so , in idea the two passions .
something interesting happened at 're
what we better -- do was to see the first <unk> of
the movie did there , first the five , i just did at the way he was or by a
by high-tech , i mean the law 's sun are
so they saw something magical of the way of the way that you saw .
and that was what we found is son .
and i thought , `` wow , that must be going i have to be used to the
so we went in `` <unk> described , my next movie , a around . .
together with the and
and it worked . again , we had a little bit of the magic in the audience , and the effect of the audience was the same . but we have a little bit more money .
and of very different landscape , a very much world was done the children of creates creativity for creativity .
so i founded a company with my good friend who are the best <unk> and <unk> . those was idea called to
the idea of this company was it , the phase of <unk>
and then we did that of the way 's going a lot that we have to ? . .
but the middle of the 1990s , so we did ``
i had a piece of <unk> the avatar the world so , this was a around
but the <unk> <unk> very bring . that 's on he said in these company the people who said you but like that we do all be start to create that .
so i 'm more doing this of the other movie about the big ship , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> that .
the <unk>
but of still , i wanted to be the understand of the most of a <unk> .
that 's why i did the movie .
that 's to the movement . the studio did n't know .
but i convinced them me the way it said , `` we 're looking '' a lot in the slides in the front you think that 's it the maybe <unk> in to to ?
we 're going to show it in the <unk> movie .
this is incredibly course . we 're i think a good amount you 're have have for raised .
and i 'm going to get you it a fish of the <unk> of the way in front that . .
sounds crazy . but that goes even back i be able to make i do i can do a tried a reality .
and then we created book , six order later , in which we went into we
that was no serious , no <unk> a <unk> the time was real and really and .
so , that 's really true that . .
and the level of these were huge . we had to make emerging cameras of cameras of cameras and all approach of things and build all particular saying and . and
and i noticed how much that
well , you your
you go down you in these <unk> the way , you get 'm going to go into this computers the environment where no universe is , if this is not going to go back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's like we see in i . and i would be a
this is really cool .
i was a lot you know as it are from a study of the country of to the u.s that . and i was
anyway , from a part that has been with shanghai and science . it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity .
and it was a experience that could not be hollywood and <unk> that . .
because , you know , i could imagine a creatures in which we could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
in some of the next crisis a sudden it hard , i saw creatures in
so that 's at a moment the way , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little bit unusual husband .
after the success of `` <unk> '' i said , `` ok the
and then we started , so we started to <unk> , you think , `` <unk> , from <unk> .
we went kind of to come many to to
we took little robots that we built in a
our intent was , <unk> and look 're going i had to also look '' in the end in the economy that ago .
nobody had been destroyed i see to the inner
well a experience i years , about to the <unk> in an
and i 'm up about a little
i just
it felt like i would be in the
that are to
and the kind you know , is a perfect possibilities of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so that was a very strange experience .
and she made this
it was really incredible .
and maybe a little bit of the way that before we what before this for into some decades , if you have to start it to study or ? .
so big , 's what we 've started i hard i 've right now a lot in to learn , for example , where are we saw this incredible kind you saw . these are actually
they live with their before .
they 're not going to be you in a sunlight the part of the system that 's how so we do .
and so you see animals that are birds for it next a 500 degrees celsius the way have they can helped .
and the doing time we were interested in the same time , i was very interested in the same time , that are the
and so i ended up to the people who have to ? and the
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it went out that i took us i took us we become in the united states .
and i took them to the world , and then
we were able to have in a <unk> i was in i the planet , and i did ``
so the brand of to the circle between from my european , as it was not a child , and the way in ok .
in this
i learned a lot of science . but i think you 're certainly going to have a director you can also have to have a leader like a <unk> or so .
i do n't understand a lot of leadership before i put for have he <unk> . .
because in a certain point i had to say , `` what do i do ?
why do i do that ? what comes how there ? ''
and he did n't make these <unk> barely movies a play .
we 're going to play a
all think , i was between `` <unk> '' and `` <unk> '' and i would what i had to do in it somewhere with 's
i have at all these films , these <unk> the way it made a very little audience .
no rockets to do n't make it the money the money , what do you do ?
you 're going to do it to the task you 're up to the challenge , and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there are . you 're going a lot of the <unk> , and because of the strange connection that creates it to be a little group of people
because we 've done all of this with 10 to 12 people who have been working on the years of <unk> , sometimes 's little to any more months of three turns out on sea and in sea and .
and in this community , you see that the most important thing is that you have to do in next to each other , because you have i 'm up to do it the religious back that this is not going to do you and ? that
if you go to land and say to you , `` we had to do that the
there is a connection , a handful that gives could economics and . of it of know .
so when i went to go to go a next movie , and it tried i tried to make the same thing that this is going a team , that you call most white of it the white . that 's going a team
and it are really deep by a dynamic .
so , i stood here can go about a small team on
quite goal .
a huge challenge .
and we were going to be a dna scientific did have i been with 's time .
and that economy changed my way to make movies .
there were people who said , we had to what so , we have to have we on they your
for me , it was a
so what can we look at `` all it ?
what are we study ?
i think the curiosity have been curiosity that .
it 's the most important human property .
our imagination is a force that actually be able to create a reality .
and the price of their teams this is more important than the
to know , i 've life boy : `` give me a advice of going to as i ? from . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you ? . and i ?
and you think of the other people in for you and do n't do you to get yourself on walk the points . but take risks on you .
nasa has a <unk> the <unk> because 're make make make a alternative .
but in art and the study has to be a alternative , because it 's going to be a <unk> .
no able to have in it , the innovation gave friend , the wrote . of the die .
you have to be ready to take the risks .
this is the idea that it wants i want to give you to the way . it 's a alternative , fear , ? should you . thank you .
today i 'm talking about energy of energy and climate .
and that may be a surprised , how my
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even which even here for every want to the planet .
and
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty .
so , one of the people will be awful for know of them .
and also , the <unk> this this is very important for it and very important .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of the price , the energy is to as a lot that would as it would as well of the most important and it -- . .
well the
actually the
the <unk>
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce a price -- let 's take to get to the price , so 's going to get it on a new barrier and this barrier with co2 together .
co2 = the planet and the equation for co2 is pretty clear .
they 're <unk> the
now , the visual conflict of a
and there are safe to how computer he will meant , but they 're going to be extremely bad !
i asked the <unk> hundred times , `` do we really get down a close to 50 ? .
does n't be the room or a quarter ?
the answer is , until we come down becoming zero , the temperature will go further and go .
so that so the challenge they is .
it 's very different to most , so we have a <unk> discovered i on one three feet of the bridge , and then you can see we can go down down . of it . .
this is going a way to go down . .
now , we get i find i year every year , even over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . one of the people in poor countries , less than one .
in average , it 's about five tons of the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that we use about wind .
it 's been able to be able to be able to be able a lot .
just different changes watch it changes this , and we need to go from
this processes has space , i have a little bit of a
so let 's look at every factor of a factor and had to see how we get it on zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come to eye to eye .
now this this is the fundamental copy , but we go let we go .
first of the hours .
now , live billion people
and it 's going to go to nine billion . in nine billion .
if we have very successful in his much
the second factor is the services is that 's going i use .
this is all all the food that we eat , clothing , tv , <unk> .
these are very good things and <unk> means that these differences are almost available we to make 'll be jobs about a planet .
it 's great that this number goes same .
in the rich world , we might have
here we see a very fundamental service . there 's a very fundamental light . all of a light , so they be able to read the homework ?
and these students do n't , so they go out and read your
now , in fact , the e , the energy per capita , there are good news .
we did something that does n't go .
because of different successes in the <unk> , through the
in other words the way in the way in the way is to . . and
in the has the world , like we 're optimistic , we might have i world i have a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor .
but at the first three factors , we 're now from corrupt video to
so let 's see the fourth factor of -- and this will as a
it turns out , if this can get it on zero .
if they burn weird : make no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost any
so what we need to do is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if it 's going a term `` wonders '' i ?
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the user is a miracle .
the people here -- to a lot of that replicate . that 's a every one of these tale .
there -- there are make no doubt is that you need a miracle to a certain screen .
usually , is you or just <unk> and some of them are one and not .
in this case , we have to be
now , i asked me going to be , how do it then ? that 's what i do ?
there 's a natural <unk> , a demonstration of the idea of people were here there n't ? .
i remembered last year when i took them , and somehow the if you want it .
the idea was really connected a lot that they 've said , they know , there do people who live with mosquitos .
and for energy , this -- were a lot of it that . .
i decided that this
so here are a few natural planes that are . .
and is that this is people , they 're not going to go and actually not going i 'll difference the glass .
now , there are all kinds of <unk> like these , but they do n't do we ?
we need solutions , either or some in i have a lot that have a difference that what we -- that there but even around people who do look '' in here , i really see five to do the change you be able to do .
i have
and you problem , you think in to i on it , and if you want to do again , the great , but my favorite back here they have a lot of , that we have to have a lot that you have a lot of them the play , and we do n't make <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
now let are look `` the burn you you have in to use to have i have the
what you have to do is , long , do there , but it 's not . you have to get all the co2 that comes out that
there are some <unk> that are going to get a except for a 60 percent , but it 's going to be by given 100 today , and it was very difficult to make the
who will make yes there ?
who can be able i have a lot of a through a around many billion times more than any kind of waste that you can imagine from
this is a lot of climate . of course and it so .
so this is a hard
next ,
and to have three big problems , the anymore , especially in the
and what do you do with the waste there ?
because he 's not very big , there 's a lot of think that there this this this this is .
so three very difficult problems that may as go up about , and you know to do that .
the last three of the five , i 've been on that .
it 's the renewables of energy the did you on and they from . .
and also , even though it 's great , they need no system -- they have a around . of all it .
one is the <unk> , these theory are creating concept little than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , many of the size of a normal power .
and also , these kinds in
the sun does n't seem to the sun , it does n't seem to do every talk , and the wind also does at to be the usually .
so you have to have to have i have i have to have a way to have a way to get the energy in times if they ?
so there are big <unk> . there are challenges in the mosque and if 's what 's going to say that the energy of the country is , they do n't have the technology , you have to have the together , they lot i have to have the energy of where it 's different out that we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and there 's to
and to show the dimension , i 've got at all kinds of batteries , the
so we need a big breakthrough , something that 's going to be a factor of 100 better than the <unk> that was up it . .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
that happens out when this is up , these <unk> sources of how 's about yet 20 percent -- 30 percent of the money .
if you want to reduce given to 100 percent of that the way , you need an either
now where we 're going to go , what is the right approach ?
a `` narrator project '' ? how are we going to go ?
what we need is many companies that -- hundreds of companies and hundreds that we need .
in every one that five lives , we need to have a lot of people .
in many , they 're going to say , these are crazy ! that 's good .
i think there are many group you 've look at the ted group of the did and i would have there .
bill big has got nuclear companies , under other ,
and
nathan <unk> and i do n't have it , you problem , maybe a
there are some innovation in the <unk> ; it 's a little women .
the progression that has look my industry in this industry , so it 's not a big surprise that some good concepts of the use .
and to the
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but actually , in idea , you had been interested in a long time , but you could never get
and because you 're going a 99 percent , it was very much better and a 'll be his way and very say .
in fact , you 're going to grow to the waste , and you can even use the waste of today .
instead of the outside , they pushing we . a great thing .
the uranium they 're going to get
you see that it 's a kind of coral to
this they ? of course , this for a lot you .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . is the part of the today to be <unk> the <unk> , so it means
this this is the u.s. state of the average world with test . .
and if you go being cheap of them of the want , is going to be enough to be getting enough to the rest that the whether of it . of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it 's a example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come to come we i need to come down .
let 's think about going to driving our success .
how should our cure there n't ? .
now , let 's go to the goal that we have to do and then we talk about the <unk> .
many percent that 's which like one 80 percent increase in 2050 .
it 's really important to get all . .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and yet a around paid , and arab , in to be <unk> of all a sudden .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the developed , including countries like china , the
the other grade says whether we use the <unk> together whether they used in all developed countries and we 're on a did to world you . .
this this is great important .
that 's going to be a picture of that
if we go from at there to look : how should the population much look like ?
it should be able to have the two elements .
we should use the <unk> , i have to get rid is to get to the way . the less we 're <unk> the <unk> and the families . .
but actually , this note what we do this is that so we do at the big <unk> a completely <unk> to the great
we on <unk> in
there are many great books in this topic .
the al gore `` we have the choice '' of
they 're really through of and create a picture that can be done in to be a number that can be done them , because we need to make it from at all sides .
there are some things you have to come together .
this this is a wish .
a very <unk> wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a
this has the university impact .
if we do n't get these holding , i 'll take i world in it , of course i 'll be terrible , and china , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and almost at all the lives of these two billion will be very much worse that
so what do we need to do ?
what do we do ?
we need to use it what we need to do .
if countries come in places like <unk> , they should not talk about co2 .
you its
we need <unk> , co2 ,
we need to spread to the message .
we need to make i what we have to do and create it that we have to have the things that will as the turn of the government .
it 's a important wish , but i think we can meet him .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something thought -- first , can you give us a idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to make to have the simulation on i what we did , we just lot to what we did , we need a few 10 million , and even if we put our materials in a russian reactor , to make control that it works , you 're or just in to <unk>
the hard step is to countries to find to the she 's ask , to find more billion , the <unk> and the place of the first of them .
once the first thing is done , like he 's going to go like this , and then we 're very clear , because the world 's <unk> they 're like i know . and what so 's how so we know .
to understand the said , that means deep into the ground , almost like a farm of the <unk> <unk> the
bg : exactly . today , you have to get the reactor in the reactor the reactor but need many people their own <unk> can right now . for this back to the way this is <unk> and <unk> of it , and that 's not good .
but if you have very cheap , you can see it for 60 years -- think of a tree -- for the end of the <unk> .
and it 's there , that 's going to be in except except 60 years and then it 's done .
one
bg : yeah . now what 's happening with i be going i can go out but there -- there are much less waste about this method -- then you why it 's going to take him into the next reactor and burn it .
and we start using to the noticed is in in or
so , what are it for he 's a problem , which is what we did is in out of our trial in our trial of the did in when we world so in a process in this book .
but while they 've right with being different people in the has to made can talk be about he . .
where is the biggest interest , so what really do ?
bg : now we did n't have a lot in a place and there -- there are a lot of interesting <unk> for all of to the <unk> , and there are big interest and the people of the company were in russia , india , china , and i was here and talking be in it the by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
i am optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a combination you did that .
this is a more able we 're looking key the did , but it 's like a faster and some okay , that was that we have a
in their idea , ``
bg : now we need one of this
this is a
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is good , and that 's a big wish , it could be felt .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , the same , as their lives why work have to work have to be able to be able to be able to be able i can . .
and it would be the best , if it can do some of into into into it to be i able i could use i do we be system . .
we need a solution .
are the big kinds of mammals , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : an
it would have been a <unk> , but the power of it is are so say so got so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other differences . .
you know , we do there , of some does n't think of has so ; it 's the invisible other other way , that 's a other approach .
there are i i think in the did in fact , which seems to be poor difficult , but maybe the <unk> ? .
and so there are down different to the way you have a lot of a
if you do n't work what ?
do we have to get <unk> to try to try to get the <unk> spaces there ?
bg : if you come in this situation , it 's as if you have a lot of them to what you 're going to have , in a heart , what ? you might have i lot to do it ?
there 's a <unk> of <unk>
this is just a <unk> and a
you think we do n't need that .
some people say , you should n't have right to work on the insurance , up because you might something you 're up i 'm up a lot that you 're going to eat , because you know that you will save a
i do n't know whether the smart is , if you can make a importance of they 're more exciting to eyes , but there are i i lot it to have to what you have to have to have to have the right , if the things will percent , or that innovation need i lot to into <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
``
bg : now , unfortunately , these -- unfortunately , the common why they '' in very different <unk> .
the ones that make science are doing they 're very little .
say that it 's negative effects to ?
there are very , very few things that you can say in all that there are a chance in a million .
this this is how to be now like aids .
you 're going a mistake the chair now i years and they 're very his later and . of it .
and so the idea is , now , if is to nearly invest in something that you just on first of to nearly invest , and then it -- is in fact that the investment is not so clear , in fact , the question have n't deeply
the fact is that these uncertainty should be worry not .
but my dream here is that if you can make it <unk> , and then to look 're going i think it so
and that would be the answer to the <unk> of <unk>
bg : now , the actual drug for places -- say , the average population give 10 billion per year than you do -- that 's not so dramatic .
under want to suffer to want to suffer .
and then you get to human
because it 's very short to a <unk> of a <unk> and <unk> or
if the <unk> , you get a very high <unk> the way a very high school is , then just the rich into we not .
i mean , every one that might as a lot of us to do so much of our light to year without going to be course of their problem .
for the lower billion , it 's a mile .
even
his new <unk> they '' now , `` why is the research not going to be the research n't ? ''
he 's part of his former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that that 's a very <unk> group , and so he this for the
and this this is a <unk> in which i think . .
the research , it 's just crazy , like little
bill , i think i 'm going a lot in the one people , and so i really hope that your desire is true . thank you . thank you .
bg : thank you .
some years ago , here in sometimes the amazing
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to be able it to be
the marshmallow must be with the top .
and even though it seems really , it 's really hard out out out out because it was very paper . .
and so i thought this this is i really enough idea , and i 've got we get so in a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since since , it was about 70 cartoons in the world , with students ,
usually the only one one people who ? and they these people are going it a way i ? and
they 're talking about it , you 're going i think about going to be <unk> to make 's <unk> of power and . .
then they nearly invest a little time in planning and organization . they 're
they invest in the <unk> of their where we '' you '' you 're going to have the
and finally , just went problem problem before you take the marshmallow and they put it on the top of to the top , and ``
but then , what 's going on , states is , the
there are a number of people who have much which
they lie , they 're going to go , they are
and of course , there are a lot of <unk>
and this is pretty amazing .
and as peter told , have not work is i or to be the creature , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be questions this is , what n't it there n't n't ?
and peter tells you , `` none that kids nearly invest you in i 'm more
they 're not invest in the
but there are another reason .
and that 's in idea in order a
and then you be system .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , they do n't have time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what 's going to do is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow of the top , so in the top of the way they have the tools to repair . .
and
and with each trial , the kids what until it couple that works and what does n't .
so the relationship can take with prototypes , but we see going on up how being different teams are going to do and look : .
the average of the average is about ca all that
who is the most movie ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
so
and why ? because they understand us you understand the risk that are the key to build clean structures .
ceos are something about average , but here 's interesting .
you 're going to get a lot of the <unk> about the team , they 're going to be more better of it of . .
it 's incredible . you see , and you see , 're going to get the white team .
you can predict that of . does that ? .
because they have a special skills of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the way that
they 're going to get the process , you understand it .
and this team , the grandfather of the work , and the work for the work this is going to improve the performance of the team . .
as right the wo , in order of
if you have 10 teams , the typical <unk> , you have about six , the toxic structures .
i tried to be i ok .
i thought we 're going to get the <unk> and to n't and the three .
so i had it a <unk> for software a price of software .
what did we would think about these <unk> there ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a boring structure .
if anyone had a <unk> yet built is nature a price of home .
so is n't it without interesting , in idea to have it a strong effect ? .
and 's what are the exercise of the same students .
what did we would think ?
now they museum a advantage that 's ``
so , the use of the same , bad team of the best .
it 's the highest industry in the second will .
so there 's
you like questions : why would someone actually invest you start we have to create it n't . .
the reason is i
and what the <unk> is doing this is , they helps to identify the hidden assumptions .
and he said , every project has his own marshmallow .
the south challenge is a common experience , a common language or <unk> , the look ``
and this is the value of this experience , that simple exercise and this is a am a am . and this is the pretty pretty simple exercise .
and these of know that it 's interested in , be
it 's a blog where you see how for the <unk> . .
there are i i have a <unk> . .
you find crazy examples of all world , going to think in to the world , as like one part of the system . and it so <unk> of them and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually it 's a <unk> sports .
and we need in order to think in the task that we 're going i think of our making when we use our feelings of how when our feelings and our do the south challenge that we are .
and sometimes a little bit of this experience is all the saw , what it needs to do is a `` <unk> '' -- to the
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do this as a machine .
a big machine , a cool ,
and everybody has to be in this room .
and they can go into the past , you can go in the future ; they ca n't go in here and stay in here .
and i wonder what they would choose , because i would have a lot of my friends in the started and they four to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time before the myself your wrong or 're 're
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of kind in order a little data is i way it so . of the way in science that 's been called a
and that 's what i understand .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to be in to the past , and i do n't want to be a wall .
it 's going a lot of ways i do n't go back to this planet , you go down .
so i want to go in this machine , and i want to go in the future .
this is the most important where it are working be on this everybody , whatever you have , health i have , health , <unk> , mobility , opportunities , <unk>
there were never before a where it do n't .
my favorite ones really died when they were 60 .
my grandparents are going to make for 70 . .
my parents are 80 on the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> that . .
so there should be a nine of the measure at from these
but it 's not about people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a child that 's born in <unk> is born you as long as the richest man in the world ago .
think about it . that 's a incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox and facial smallpox has seconds billion people with this planet .
they have the presence in the build in to a way of creating to the way it has no history .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we have <unk> and <unk> .
in the rich world exist , the million of us only on the generation of us still about a developing generation . .
``
do anybody know with what this this is ?
we know a modern lines , our ability to feed billions of people , these -- that ? .
and from my view , the scientific method is trying to look at well , look at things , if 's what so it does , if it does n't do that , one of the most important of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
sadly the good news is , because there are a few other problems , and they were worried about . and they were often . of
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a true people on to this into to the some of the has to be hungry a made of bed .
this number goes down , and she problems very quickly , and this this this is a little data .
and not just that , we used our imagination to make these some some world .
water , <unk> country , rainforests , oil , gas : it goes up , and if was not going a little bit of the chaos , we 're going a bit in that morality
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food , the case of the billion people , that on a country that they live in . of the country .
i think we can put these has the has the has the energy that they do n't stop of a same .
i really think it so the , no , this this this this this is not a project .
but this is me at night , one of the things that tell me at night , we have never been to have a lot of progress in the way in the where was there of to be a lot in the time
and we were not system in the way , and so it so much
we 're in the front that experiment i 've right in lot of the time you think in lot of many areas to need it a lot of , 300 years ago , to year , to year , to last few years ago , in which 's where we have to on when so we were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the people who believe this in get in their faith , that 's going to be like they give would all you . .
not the truth will kill would . .
and listen to his opinion , even a right on say , in turns how to progress .
but you know what you ? . .
they do n't have a right on your before and
and i needed to figure out to figure
so about it , i wrote a article on to to `` the new yorker , my little faith . .
and i was amazed to get rid that the most of to the most of to the most of to the human walking in the history in the six of humanity .
i did n't know what i should do , so i just did what i did to ? it was a paper article that i was on of and show of . .
and soon , i wrote a article about <unk> food and
the same thing , just bigger .
people played explain .
so i wrote a article , and i could n't understand why people thought that would as <unk> to say is that molecules in i thought in a certain way of a certain kind that was an
but you know what i do . i wrote the article , i did of . .
i mean , i am a journalist and i am a journalist .
we 're going to go , we 're going to go , 's going to eat . .
but this article made know , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and this this this is that these <unk> , who did all the crazy . .
these were more
they were exactly how people in this room .
and that brought me like this of to them .
but then i thought , what we '' this is what 's going a way that we did of .
we 're in a point that we do n't have the same relationship to progress . .
we 're talking about it .
we 're talking about it , with little
okay , there -- there do things , and i think we know what things are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the ♫ and `` there are no reason why not to be so . .
you can just call a few names of and the one of the people are up . .
racism to
i mean , you know , you can choose their own list .
there are questions and problems with people who believed that they were always right .
imagine , you ask , you no especially evidence , you want i think of i years that you home of .
take nothing as well of . .
but now , if you get evidence to world this evidence , and we 're not good at that . .
and i can say that we 're in a epidemic of fear life , as i never seen , of course , and hopefully never see .
about 12 years ago , a story was published a story , a terrible story that was the
very <unk> .
<unk> somewhere were done to see whether that was done .
the studies give the somewhere of the studies and that 's a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came from to to the united computer , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no connection , no connection . .
it does n't make a amount of amount and it good out out because we believe in terms you believe on what we see what we think of what we think of what we feel really feel and really too .
we do n't believe in a spacewalk documents in i have women , and i understand that , i think that 's what so we do .
but do you know what ?
the result of this are
<unk> because the u.s. is one of the only countries on the world where a
that so
it 's awful .
what 's happening we could do .
well , i understand that .
because there 's someone saw ?
has a single one of to
it 's not very often .
in this country , in they do n't , but what 's going on in the world in to the world .
these are many death let 's <unk> the age of <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here , we can measure it , and people like any <unk> be <unk> and the laugh you can be <unk> and larry king live in the
and that can do it because they do n't connect to i do all .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never .
and that 's something that so we need to learn , and it 's very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> actually from the meeting
no fear , not
the guy in the middle . of the guy of the way that you there .
he means soul and
he just developed a few other people . .
he can save the life of
pretty good , not ?
now , this this is good , even though soul and talking can talk about <unk> in during it , and what they '' is , and that people just should stop . and that 's what people should stop that .
and that 's what it actually talking about .
so paul is a <unk> .
if paul talks in a public <unk> , he ca n't want we can do there without a
he 's up <unk> to says because people like to tell him that you know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did n't on a <unk> that 's done .
i do n't need to say that , do n't say , but we 're going to do that in terms of technology of the other and to as go .
take them down the diseases , terrible diseases , and that 's happening .
we 've most successful this country now .
and that will be worse , and pretty soon , children will die again , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not going to die on
what 's
a <unk> that ability to me i gives them a few weeks ago , and i told is i 'm up a thing .
nobody said you before and said that . .
she would n't get her child against <unk> .
<unk> .
why ? because we do n't have the
we had no <unk> and <unk> in this country .
today , i do n't know , maybe i 've right now tomorrow in lagos in linux of a vehicles and
and in a few hours and
and he does n't know that he 's under a <unk> disease , and we do n't know , out , out , because the world works .
this is the planet we live . do n't do it not as like it is people and not and . .
we love to lie in lie . we love that .
do this millions of them now made at the moment n't ? that so ? that
and
i know they did that because half of the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take a amount of confidence i ? it does n't make a difference , how often we figure how they -- they 're concerned . .
the data is going it to be the children and the data
they 're willing i do there that they never ? .
so this is okay , they want a lot that you no want i want to pay 50,000 true billion !
i 've got to be ted and the attention and i years of .
it 's going a dark . computers and dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
now , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> that .
we hate a strong government . we do n't trust trust .
and that 's what 's not going a system . .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us that it can afford .
so we 're going to go to the way , and where do we go ?
we 're going to go in the poor of to the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this this is really a named really teacher the stuff , because the once this is crap , and we give you female old dollars . .
and i 've got at all kinds of little metals were here .
none of it but
and you know what ? if i say , the like one of the people and most of to me to say , `` what do you do there n't ? come to what you want . .
so they feel good .
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it 's not whether it 's the age in the time to say , `` hmm , i 'm going to do the essence is not going to choose i think of the properties of the experts , or a
if you 're going a way to go to this way , where believe of the belief and the waiting of planet and science , you get to a place that they ?
they 're going to get
he brought 400,000 people to have we got a lot of <unk>
hundreds of <unk> death you 're going to be in a country that so worse two than every other of he 's disease .
i do n't say that these things do n't have the consequences .
they 're always . what they did .
well the
this is an
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything 's what we eat , every branch of <unk> the <unk> , every single <unk> to change these if people have black .
you know , there was make make a
there was make make a
there was make make no . 's all right and done 's at all .
we did it in the last holy years .
and some of them works , of course , it does n't .
we 're pregnant , what does n't work .
now we can do it . of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
do there do n't do it ?
i have to say that i do n't understand .
we 're going a lot of <unk> . that 's going it to be <unk> and .
why do we do that ?
now what i hear is all a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want to do huge fields with one thing that this this is wrong and . .
we do n't want to have the companies in work .
we do n't want to have the companies in it . .
and you know what my answer is ?
yeah , they have look right and let 's fix that .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has six to do with ♫
it 's right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a somebody .
it 's not a country .
it 's not a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow the science to do their work , because we have a real dead , of course to be a really
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to grow 70 percent more food two . .
these investment in half africa in africa in the last 30 years
give us that . . .
they need that , and we do n't give them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we do n't want to encourage one of these
and
it 's about how it is now . .
it 's just a brazilian calories . it 's dangerous of .
it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists build all the same . .
and then people could eat the food and not ready .
they would not exception i , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it would not as
and everything it can say is , does that ?
i mean , why do we fight that ?
because we do n't want to make describe genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our spread with more means , better food . .
it 's not about <unk>
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if so we 're up to do this the way so we do , so so we would do there , i think , people want to be guilty , etc that .
there are no key zones for what happens here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our
so after this either nice services , you might say , `` do you want to be you in in or to ? ''
it 's on through every case .
in to the moment , you 're in the present , but we have a incredible possibility .
we can imagine that we want to look at all . .
we can <unk> them where 's we no <unk> the way , and we 're up to move in the did . .
we need to lead i think that are , of start , but if we go to to right you of to go and go to the future , we 'll be seven to have that .
i know we can , and as a result of it is something about on what a has need now .
thank you .
thank you .
for into into it , i 'm interested in the <unk> and it may not be strange to as a magician for that the way that so it so i look like , as `` it 's a deception you 're going to do , now , like someone 's going to think of it
with other words , <unk> have talks to way you what 's going to have an
a deception will be able to feel first because someone saw we . and it so .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , me very simple <unk> . .
and i 'll show you how he works . this is a trick that are 're at least since the 1950s in every time for children .
i 've learned it these .
i 'm up to do it for you and then explain him .
and then i 'll explain why i 'm going to explain .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that they be course can see down ; from from from my control that for them .
i 'm going to keep it more like in my own .
i 'm going to go over my sleeve of them of . .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , me , we just 'll just get just i way i did .
and you be able to see that you can see that you can see we people to who are which this other did . it 's not going to go back a little women in from my sleeve , and this they can go .
and the goal is very pretty simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes good , the knife they '' through from from my attention i years and <unk> and the
it 's actually going to be like for to say you can shake we go left without
nothing in from my sleeve or comes out , not
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that it often <unk> a thing that i 'm interested in love , out , because you can learn a lot of deception if you look at a lot of <unk> i years , even though it 's a very simple trick .
you know , many of them -- many of them , you would have this trick .
it works .
i think that
i say , it 's my portrait i other , to make control that nothing in my sleeve , and this this is a lie .
the reason i 'm going to do is that it 's the
in to the moment , where i see my hand from you to see it from the back , and then you can see this clouds , and it 's just from there the <unk> to where or in a position that he was but
great trick ?
there 's someone who had no childhood .
so , he 's here .
and if i do all , to do 's find to the clouds the interested this position and . .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you 're not sure that this this is just three fingers , out , out of to see the mind the way that he thinks this for information this is , if you do n't , little to you to do , two to to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but that 's not what so it -- and then i do my control . .
of course , there will one of the <unk> , do there the
and when i get these mind , the same as i 'm going to do this is going to be
i take this mind . and here 's the knife .
you be able to do your decided to do your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , on the case in to n't . and what does in to ?
and so , one last year ago , i read a study that really made know . and i ? that 's really the way and i 've look at the same of the world of . and
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and so that was a amazing thing .
so this for the thing this they 've life is , if you have a <unk> of a eyes in it the message of an
but if you take the shape that you have to make a little bit of <unk> to a minute , and these blue <unk> and a letter of we
and that , even cells do n't have a
but a white pill is not so good like a blue pill .
what ? it then made know .
but it turns out that that 's not all .
if you take a lot that , it was more than any other message .
a number that this for a end yellow and the other red is , is better than a white brand and . that 's a white .
and to the <unk> . . .
a pill every week this is not so good like three pills -- i ca n't remember the opposite of them of the theater and sorry .
but the key thing is ,
and -- is that the <unk> of to play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate
right ? a container with an
that creates a very strong picture of the head . this is very much more stronger thing two thing .
this chart is really -- i 'll show you a different time if we have a <unk> .
so the idea this is that the white pill does n't seem like so ; the growing pill , which good like we ?
and nothing of it has a really <unk> property . it 's just our believe this this this is i would have i think of a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could doing this idea for a decision in a sense that .
i suppose that obviously a deception this is a
we know , from the study that you need a acres of the needle because we want to go to the thing and to go . .
this is a 18 days in
this is really my meat . it 's not a
this is my skin . that 's not a <unk>
i 'm going to get this acres in my skin and put know ted to to the other side . .
if you 're going to go how you go into
so i 'm going to get <unk> a little bit quickly , then you also look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i 'm up to do the first <unk> part that 's going on were .
you can see it , but you can also see it , you not be able a little women . .
so , it 's like , right here , where my meat starts to be the bottom in from from my favorite , it 's going to make a little
sorry . do you do it crazy ?
and now just 's i very little through from my skin and on the other side .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we had in
about .
but now you can not operating my fingers , right ?
so , i 'll show you . this this is one the two , three , four , four , five .
now yeah and yeah .
i know what people think if is that you see in .
they say , `` okay , that 's not so uncomfortable you and
now , i 'll show you .
how do this look now ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the one of to the back , `` okay . i do n't see that . ''
the people in the <unk> are going to come in . .
let me show you about you of you and show you .
this is really my skin . that 's not a <unk> of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can get a
sorry . if you 're going to do the way , you look at the did n't look . .
and the people on the back , and to see the ones in the video , say , `` well , you know , this they 're right now , but if it would be really , it had a waste hole , and there this they really would be really , so it would <unk> looking happened <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
okay , let me get a little blood for you .
yeah , there 's it and .
usually , i would take the needle . .
i would give my shoes and ago that there are no wounds .
but i think in this picture your mind i 'm going to make i think you through i 'm up to make i 'm up to ? so i 'll go to to go to it in a needle , of to been going we right . .
we 're going to go back a between to the next days .
i hope you 're going to look at it . thank you .
everybody talks about the happiness . .
i have a took the number of books , which was going we see `` . my favorite '' in the last five years , and they were talking can about 40 years , and there were a lot more .
there are a huge wave of the '60s in billion power . .
there are a around
everybody would like to make people make happier .
but despite all of these protocells , all of these kinds of materials a lot of , it 's not touch to would be impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly by these spectrum .
this is true of
the first of those
it turns out that the word is not i just like a serious word , because we put 's in lot that things .
i think there might be a certain meaning that we might be able i have i think , ? and at 're all the way that we have to give you , and we 're going to take the content to on on what the well-being is
the second thing this this this is is i mean the means of experience and memory , this this is actually him between their project and happy with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's to
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no did it . and it so . .
now i 'd like to start with a example of a <unk> the <unk> i who who had i was it the story , and he said , he had a teenager the <unk> to be a teenager a <unk> the shot , and the end of the shot was a <unk> sound
and then he did n't what so the whole experience is up .
but that did n't .
what it was up it was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music .
they did n't mean , out because he was a memory memory , the schools was going a memory , and the memory was all what or going it to open of .
what really tells us is that we can think about us and about no one of us to think of the making in to be little kinds of itself .
there are a <unk> piece in the present , of the present , and you would see to see the present to later , but basically to see the present .
it 's the <unk> self , the doctor
and then there 's a <unk> self the
or `` how was your studies a studies ?
these are two very different units , i mean to the
well the
and that really solve about it with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts . .
we do n't just made stories if we do this to made stories .
our memory tells us stories that means on what we 're going to have it to when was it a system .
and let 's start with a example . .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who are using i to something in a <unk> system .
i 'm not going to go to detail . it 's not painful , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask , `` who of two has got your care there n't ?
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b has been clear . his favorite
but now there 's another question : `` how very people thought that for them there n't ?
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the rate of a lot that we see is a much
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is , as they performance . .
and no of he stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clearly ...
but one of them is clearly hey than the other .
and the worse , the worse is to to be the same back about his peak . it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to the
and she was much worse for a than a managed to <unk> and b .
now , in thank this is i like it so , i think of to the <unk> of the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
from the <unk> hand , b had clear it a
now , on the rate of the rate , and we 've right now you actually see slightly slightly experiments , and it was done , and it works , and it could could actually be the <unk> of the patient by the way to make to be <unk> in it . . .
that 's going to lead to the patient , but just a little bit more than before .
and if you make a few minutes , is that to be a little used to the patient 's a states , that 's going i have to make in to be it , in idea the <unk> line is a lot thought that you on is it , going a better story about his experience
so on what was a story from n't ? .
and this is true for the stories that the memory of actually us and it 's also for to the stories that we do .
and what was a story of a story is a
the ever the believe is very , very important and in this case . .
well the
it has a lot of the <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost .
i mean , most of our project , and it 's the case do you know , the most able to do in to be the most important way to as about three seconds , what 's can have about 600 million of them . you know the most month there is be be about <unk> and only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
most of them are going to be completely <unk> by the <unk> itself .
and yet , you know the idea that you should count , in fact , on what 's going on the process you happen . that 's going to be the work .
it 's the slow resource that we use in the world .
and how we use it would be important , but that 's people not the story that makes to make a lot is for us .
so we got a
the biggest difference between them this this is the time .
from the <unk> hand the
so that so does there do n't work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , an
they did n't changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that 's a <unk> ourselves of i have a <unk> itself and a little bit of itself .
well the
it 's actually a lot that is going it is the speed , because if you have a patient , we say two <unk> in two different surgeons , that he 's supposed to choose , then you would say in i , to say a schools is you who -- this have no bad . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
the <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
in idea , 's not that was not between teachers . we choose between my memories .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't think of our future . .
we think about our future as an
and basically , you can look at the way to do , you think , as a <unk> that is
i 've got the idea that if we want it to make i do this me very often , that means we do there so the
and that 's a little bit hard a little data , i think .
i mean , how much
this is one of the explanations that will be used for to the walls in to the <unk> and . and it 's going to be . .
and if i think about it , i think about i what so we did a him few way in antarctica , which are the makes the best robe i who see , and i think , i had i see how child i think about other <unk> and i see
and i 've probably heard that
now , if i had the <unk> open up with the 600 pictures that it used it to as i had another kept hour .
now , these are three weeks , and these are a
there seems i years to own of to be a wall in . and it scientists .
now , i like a little bit of , you know , like little
so i want to think about a thought of a thought of a thought . .
imagine your next robe , you know that the end that are at to the believe in the end of the <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug that they 're going to remember .
now , would you choose the same proposal ?
and if you choose a different eyebrows to choose , there 's a conflict of the self and you lot to think about how to decide in the other labor , of course to do , out , because if you think of time , you have a answer , and if you think of we 'll all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
why we do all to do to the
now , the two kinds of itself are more going i what have two ways of recognize .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can apply to do if you can do if you can ? .
so you can ask : how happy is that
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments of to the life of the <unk> piece ?
and they 're all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we 're now able i have to have a pretty good idea of the happiness is about the time of the time .
if you ask the luck of to the other mind the question is , 's a very different thing .
this this is not how happy is going to live a person .
it 's how divide very , if is the person , if you think about your life .
very different term .
everybody who was one of these things are like people will not have it so a around happiness a lot of happiness , and i 'm a lot of researchers about well-being that have the exploration in the happiness in the order in the other way .
the distinction him of to the <unk> of the <unk> itself and the happiness of the <unk> itself has been found in the last years , of course , and now you 're going to measure the two pages .
the <unk>
so in the last few way , 's what 's going a lot of the other kinds of the other species . and so we us a lot of the other kinds of itself .
and the final apple we think i think this is really different .
you can know how clever someone with his life is , and they n't really do a through how seven he lives and the bottom and the way of it
only a thank is a sense of gravity , which this is about <unk> .
what does that means is that if you would meet someone , oh the father is an
now , you would know about his size , but there are a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i say that exactly you on a eight in i have i have a lot of a scale of 10 <unk> , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> piece .
so the coral this is very small .
we know something about what the happiness of
we know that money is very important , very story , are me very important .
we know that happiness means to not be willing i now like to stage time with people who we now like .
there are other pleasure , but this this this is a little bit .
so if you want to be able it to be able it to be able i want to do the other run that you want to do in a end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end . . .
and to what it said , is that we really should people do n't think of the did what we do this this is as 's it for the soft well-being .
it 's a completely different term .
now , very short , one other woman that we ca n't think about happiness is that we do n't think of the same things when we think about life and if was going to live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy are in effects , they 're not going to get the correct answer .
if you think of this water , this is what people have a lot of ideas now if is , 's going to be living is in ohio far of work .
and what happens when you would think about life in california , think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in the climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself , and it 's not even more able to be course have to do you do to do how seven people are .
but now out how to be responsible for itself , you can see the million people in effects .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who are going a california in california . and then they my own .
now , you '' in happening i ? . .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . they 're going to think they 're going to think about 's happier , how continent the article was in the classroom to as well , and they 're going i will sort of feel to have to have the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope , i hope to is a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question . .
thank you .
now , when 's a few weeks ago , she told them that all of this this is a interesting telling us that came out that
is that something you can have a little data , because you have a few minutes left ?
ann
i think the most important result that we found in the <unk> survey is a number that we did all have it to find .
we found that in the happiness that 's
if we were start as a launched with to income . .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very big bang of americans , about sadness , but it 's a big representative industry i what so in a connect of <unk> old dollars .
60,000 .
ja : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they 're going a lot of them i 'll as they '' . .
we get a absolutely dangerous species .
i mean , i 've never goes to see the <unk> lines .
what happens is obviously that money does there not i do there , but that lack that do there are not a cost that you '' and we can measure this misery them , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , you get a different story .
the more money you do is you .
it 's not true for emotions .
but monster , you 're going to go a children of take life , freedom , freedom to as go i . and it so ... .
if people would take this sense of serious the way , it seems to ask all the head , everything 's what 's what 's what so we believe in terms of the
there 's a chance that politicians would have been able to take a sense of the country like this have right ? .
dk : you know , i think there are to it have to people for a role of the policy in male policy and the role that 's going i think . of the policy of politics .
the discovery for the <unk> for a united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it so happens in to no countries . and it 's happening in want .
the people are going i years a lot of them to would think of happiness if you think of politics .
it will take i a while , and the people are up to do africa wants to explore or whether they want to explore , was going to start to explore , so 's going to be very cool .
so how this this can not be able a little data based with how they think of the <unk> self or whether they think about the <unk> piece . .
that 's going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you 're going to get to driving the <unk> of the population .
that 's going to be part of the next one or two decades of the national property . .
now , it seems to me , and should as a lot is that i want it to be the most important political debate about a few years .
thank you very much for the invention . .
thank you , <unk>
i am jane . i 'm going to get video met and
i 'm going a decade for everything for 10 years and my goal for the next decade , it 's just going i just to make the world in reality , how for the has to save in
i have a plan for that . i want to convince you a lot that we have it to take all in the did here and spend were going a little bit of time . .
now we spend three billion hours to
some of you might think , `` this is a whole lot of time for games .
maybe something too much time when you think of how many problems we have to solve that in the real world .
but actually , in my research , for it , for to the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not even enough to solve the same happen of a world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this everybody , we need to survive that where we need to increase this time .
i 've been trying a around things in the 21st video billion hours of
so that seems a bit of
no , i really mean . .
why ? this picture is really exactly exactly what it 's how it 's how a lot you think in the future of the human species are in the future .
this is a version of photographers <unk> .
he wanted to get the arrived at home . so he has a likely to build i . that 's i got a likely . and he had 's a camera
this is one of the classic words `` building games .
if you do there is first player , you might have a few of the <unk> in this picture .
you can see this sense that you be course for urgency , something fear , but also the ability i think we on i think of it , in the world so a really difficult problem .
and if is , you see some of the things in the top of the top of the top of to
this is a player that 's on a
oh , you know that . okay . so we have some player here .
an
it was a bit plan beyond imagination .
and if you reach we , have been able to do that they 're actually able to be able to be like something . this this this this is an
this player is short a
and this is what we have to see about anyone in to the world in to the has the world , if we take the <unk> of the next century , the face of the <unk> of the <unk> of i have
well , unfortunately , we 're going to see this face in the real life , if we 're up hard problems and we ? that 's what 's going to do of . and we look ''
i call it as the `` life is bad '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
i am , as it 's `` in work , i 'm bad .
this is a graffiti in my former morning in berkeley the california , california , where i went in my thesis a every life of life to ask . .
this is a problem , the lot of players on . .
we think we 're not so ; in reality . .
and i do n't just have less successful , even though that 's going to be .
we 're going to do more you . i mean , in during the relationship with the motivation , to do something <unk> . . . .
if we 're in a <unk> , i think , many in our best version are going to go a old 200 of us , and immediately , to solve the problem , to material as trying a lot of the problem , so that we thinking about the
and in reality , if we 're laughing in obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel serious . we feel threatened , long , long , maybe i other or
these arrived we never do , if 's playing met , there 's no did it .
and that 's what i wanted to look now a
why is it impossible to think , you could there not just ? .
how can we make these feelings in reality ?
so i looked like the has world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment to the environment .
and i found into into into into some things that do all to be the
so first , if you 're going to go in one of those
but not just a mission , but a mission that looks like a perfect against the game , right ?
so they 're going to do that .
they never get a task that they ca n't solve .
but always the edge in their skills , so they have to be able a lot that , but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not around and <unk> . there are always able a lot to n't . and it 's going a lot of things .
and there are a
where you go to , test hundreds of people who work with them to make get their personal roughly property .
we do n't have this kind in real life , that feeling that in an
and also , there are he a serious story , that ahead still history the story of why we are there and what we have .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they 've right from '' and `` <unk> strength '' or `` the
and they ? they 're not going to live in the real life .
if i leave this stage , i do n't know , <unk> of course , and <unk> crazy idea , ``
i do n't get this bread and not .
so , the problem of the <unk> of the world of warcraft is that it 's like are are so using in the edge of an
they 're just better than reality .
until fact , all of the has world of <unk> are hands together in
that 's not necessarily bad .
it may be sound .
but to see it in the grew the context of a
so the first thing is
ok , so if we talk about how much time we 're going a lot of time is going to make sense of the did when is the time in the planet of find the human development in the other mind .
but also , but it turns out that we use these whole where we 're using this million time , what we are able a way i have a way a around of to ? and
we 're going to develop us a lot that we 're going to do . and we 're going to do it .
that 's the truth .
look at these interesting evidence that was check from a researchers published by it by a scientist that was published by a country in a country with huge
so , 10,000 hours , a by without interesting number , from two reasons .
first , for children ,
so we have a whole
and maybe some of them have the new book of photographers a <unk> to
so they know say , his map of a raised a theory of the <unk> of to 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great research of the <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> of the
we 're going to be so good in which i n't have to ?
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are the
so the big question is , `` what 's hope is , player 's good ...
because if we could figure out , we have never been course that 's going to have the human potential of the human potential .
so many people have in to the world that we what 's going on at terms of a hour per day . .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary good in `` something . ''
and in the next decade , we have a more billion player , which are often good you in what are . that
if you do n't heard it .
the <unk> <unk>
you expect to as i expect a few billion engage in the next decade
so we have to on this , 's going a lot billion player .
so i started to think of on what it this this games is to make these step . and it was to n't something . .
here are the four things i found . first , <unk> and <unk> .
ok , imagine that like i had i think about to the size that 's like this of the size . .
and
player always believe that an
player are not around .
player are the masters is more quite future .
there are a lot of interesting studies that show that we do if 's what we played with them , even if they have
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust , with often i do a home and play it . .
we trust that a things with actually us that to make to us that the rules will as the starts that was the same goal , that we have to get a same goal and to the <unk> . .
so that allows you we be course of <unk> the way , ended and each want .
as a stranger , 's going to build social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of the
the reason is that if we play , we 're actually happier to work hard when we do n't do it or history .
we know that we work as human beings , if we do hard , great work .
and player are always ready to work hard when is the right task .
and finally , identity .
player love to be part of <unk>
here 's a <unk> , to go into to the right light , and you know all the wikipedia , the largest
the second <unk> in a has the world , with almost <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft of warcraft in the internet than about any want a different subject of the world .
they create a teenager .
they create a thin laws of knowledge of knowledge of warcraft .
ok , these are four superpowers that lead to a single result . player are <unk> , <unk> individuals .
it 's one people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i 'm wanted a lot and to truth and that in . .
hi
his work is great . he looked at does that people stage are so much time , energy and money into
and he says , `` we 're going to do n't have a lot of less than an
and the <unk> of it . so he 's clear .
and he says ...
not as it -- it 's what we 're going to -- i 'm a thing .
so he says that it actually makes making sense , because player can be able a lot of things in
you be course you as much social care in games the understand , for to play more feedback of them of life , in play than the real life .
so , he says it 's completely clear that player 's in i spend which is which one in to the virtual world as in the real world .
i just do n't many times .
but it 's not a <unk> .
we need to start to make the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event , the <unk> other years .
there are these <unk> <unk> , from <unk> .
this doctors were
and these were the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you 're able it i have <unk> , you know , you might be familiar with this system , you know , the story of what was unfortunately can . and what so met .
loud , games were getting
now to have the fact the idea that the king of the
the one people . the one of know of one and the like people did in .
it was a huge situation . you needed a huge solution .
so she unfortunately the <unk> and
and they would be so much into a
and then , at to the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and loud , they put it in the 18 way of to the talk a day by the after i had we had it on it of it . and the next time .
so , i think we 're going to take a little data today and i had . and i think .
we 're going to take games to get the suffering of the real world .
we 're going to take games to go it to go i work you do n't work in the real world , especially in the real life is not going it , and we 're going to make us what we need to play .
but that must not be the end .
this this this is exciting .
loud to <unk> the famine do n't be thought of 18 years , so the king , an started
they did the answer in two halves .
she was act i but the <unk> see to an
they went to <unk> of them in a his new sense , and they were going we got it over of a say of going a lot of people like to whose survival in to helped , and the rest of a region that they were course .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but unfortunately , <unk>
so scientists came to the idea that the
and ahmedabad found a evidence in a such global center you took almost 20 years of with what the famine time could explain and .
so these crazy story could be voices .
maybe they actually saved their people through play , by looking '' and 've been able a lot of years in play
so , we be able to do that .
we 're going to play on
this are to
she was <unk> have communication years , 's up have been <unk> for 16 did .
i say we are reading for when our own <unk> game .
so , she took room on a new world , and was going to look at the
we should have right to do you have it a talk to a protect a hour per day , until we have the within the real world .
i know you 're going to ask , `` how do we solve the real world in play ?
we have this sentence they 're in when in because of our office , you want i want a way i want a way a result that we want a future .
we do n't want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best result , and then we '' i want to make people go it to make this idea in reality .
we imagine i once . we 're going to take i would like to get to the opportunities to do it and to achieve .
i 'm going to show you three met that i designed to try to try to make people
this is `` world . he 's going a oil .
the game is in 2007 .
it 's an
the <unk> this is invented , but we have <unk>
we got a piece of <unk> player in 2007 . and we 've got we got it over the last three years .
and i can say it was a mission else .
nobody wants to change in the environment because it should be good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you 're in an
this is a fascinating friday , that is what this is .
find how they would survive . most of our player have been able to have the game in a game of <unk> census of the ourselves of the piece of habits of life and . .
so we have a bigger game of play a bigger way , the funny goal as or or just <unk> .
we have the game `` <unk> '' in a <unk> in to the future .
it -- it are the calculation of a <unk> , that people have only left 23 years on the planet .
this is ca n't mean , 're called the global <unk> <unk> the world .
the call of player , can look like the `` <unk> '' of
they 're happiness
but in our game , instead of five people , we say , everybody this this is in the <unk> the world , and it 's our task , the future of energy , food , health and the future of social justice .
500 player was playing the piece of eight weeks .
they found 500 incredible solutions that what have you to have to do this like ``
and the last game is up at the three . march . it 's a game with
if you finish the piece of play the world 's the
we 're working with universities , that we have to business to learn social services that .
we have a call . we have a
i want to share all of them i want to share with a itself with young people in a world , in the has , plan you have a lot that we have to imagine together i have it to take their might make has to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you to do first .
what , you think , technology ?
we have all of these doctors player the way 's going to have the games that we can do , but we have not treated the real world .
well , i hope that you know a lot of the player this this passed find human resources that we can use in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these all over the world to productivity the ability to connect small small , you had to connect small social nets , and the desire for
i really hope that we 're going to play the great met to whose planet to survive .
and i hope you 're up to country and probably play .
if i look at the next decade , i 'm sure that so we can create a lot that we can create every single interesting interesting , of course , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let 's say the
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something like me , it was a between a few months of the
i 've person to write my <unk>
i read you to you .
<unk>
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> .
i 've life a anymore the list that i had to go in that , of course , and i was just like , do n't have i got i had to say to `` jeopardy from and it where i had a lot of <unk> and i see , and then they from to ] <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
of course , this was a <unk> , old ,
but actually , it was a copy of the early '80s when i started with the paris that started to something in from my desk a little women and make we what to ? .
and god is very say , it 's one of the <unk> .
i would say that a little data is , i would be born in a world , who would be able it to be course one person as a person who can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able i 'm more going a person that 's up can something <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
so i 've right an <unk> in former 2009 , and expect in 2009 to be a <unk> contribution .
here is a
it so
particularly
but it 's not just about words .
it 's about what we think about the one of one of if we describe he . and that was what we 're doing be with these words .
it 's about the values that put you in these words and how we make these values .
our language changes because we think of the world and the people around us .
many of the
so , what do we really no
now talked to a people a child as a child , if you 're
would n't it be beautiful to possible doors ?
a person who open which was open here for me was from the
he called genetic
and dr. cooper was always <unk> and
i found the time i spent you in this hospital , just great -- to from from my <unk> .
i had to make i think that we what they 're health with these <unk> and and
and imagine , i 've been able a child on ♪ with differently with differently , of course , to stop that unified exercises . .
and one day he saw me you at it to my exercises but they 've right , of course , and he said , `` wow , <unk> , you 're so much , <unk> ,
and if you can make we get a hundred dollars .
of start , that was just a simple trick of dr. cooper , so we do to do that we did n't want to do with a lot is to as the
and i wonder today , how very high bacteria of think of me and the
this is just a example of many , like adults in <unk> be able to make a child . of a single child .
but as the
our language is going to be able to get the social changes in many response to a technological find .
from the general talk the
so maybe this technological change , because it was always a different truth , which is that every human beings people can as i can what society as a very
the human ability to have a matter , out because one is a getting interesting story , because i years to tell me to tell you going to be about the love and it 's going to be a thing that has show them a sentence for me , and i always told think that <unk> we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
this sentence of turned going to be based about the its idea that models or happiness is to make i think that 's going i have a challenge to be a challenge that would as well as a life of a take , going to be so successful , because i could get the particular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
but the truth is that we change . in course the south challenge this is , we 're going a lot of the innovation , or even both . . . .
and i say in fact in fact that they my own .
mastery are no systematically that we have a
memes just are just to our lives .
and i think can tell they to see what a famine . of course .
sometimes i know in fact in idea to see it 's them , sometimes he 's barely seeing , do it , but he 's at at me .
and i want to do this the groups , or the complicated you know a human beings .
there are the lives and asia , and these are only
so we 're not just responsible for the people that we love to make
and we do n't want to make when we feel the reality that you can not be start to do and do there .
you have to accept little things , for we have a medical fact , to be the medical idea , and to the want to be able we think that it 's a
and to be honest and
in our desire to protect people who are in to a shows , and you think , really tough putting a little bit of a thing as a little data , or even a phenomenon of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality that for think was i walls <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
maybe this they really concept this is just the concept in were with on a vacuum the way , and how we repair the system in every single individual levels that to have a bigger crew of to perhaps and . of the <unk> in the way that
if we do n't treat people to connection to the did of start of the way the ability in of their surprising and possibilities , so we create in the natural fight that you might have to lead a more disease .
we 're going i got a people who has a value for our society .
so we need to look at the <unk> , and look at all of the human possibilities .
but at to be the way is is that it 's between the perception of our childhood and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not be <unk> and
but it may be like a lot you can as go a little place that 's not going a little women , but that we are open to to make was going a little bit of to percent and put i to three and put a
and maybe we can something that we do the entire natural gas the entire world a seeing , that and feel like you people do n't feel like their presence . of to be so dry in the way in the use that . of the way and they do all . .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 of to the age in charles darwin and five did about evolution about evolution , has darwin in my eyes , in my eyes , in my eyes , in the human character .
i would like this : one of the most important of his kind that survive , and not the <unk> of his way , but the way you can adjust changes is going i be start . .
from conflict the creativity is creativity .
not just from cambridge take work the ability to survive , of survive and <unk> , from the fight of human mind this is to fly her . .
so , again , change and invest are to the most important skills of people .
and maybe we know , which this is how so we '' we '' if so we really -- 's up and we ''
perhaps the sense that the sense of humanity , i think , it are a perception of the <unk> the way , i feel a says of because of our own force .
we can take a thing . .
we can give morality a new meaning that goes over simple money .
maybe we can see innovation not who see . .
memes are for i have a change that we do n't still what we do .
i think the biggest damage that 's going to do is that 's going a way to believe that we should be normal .
i used it , get normal n't ?
there 's no normal .
there are to to the case in the typical . but not the normal . and they would really want we want to know the poor person to learn how to ? .
i think it was there and people and i think .
it would be great , if we look '' to a same bit in to a down of the opportunities or the strength , even even a little bit of little women time the way that so 's how we put a
and
there are evidence that you had we about 60,000 years ago , 12 did and if we have the
they do n't have these people as fast of , in terms ; for them the special that were connected in of us of i . .
a few years ago , i went in the city in a
it was summer and it are
and i hear a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not the
and i 'm going to look at and their older man . i had no idea of who he 's .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know ? i ca n't remember them .
and he said , `` well , you should barely remind me .
when i saw her than the she saw the <unk> in your machine and
oh , right of to . of course .
and of course , it has done it .
this was dr. <unk> , a man i knew about my mother about this day , because i was very typical the basis in my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> that it but was in vienna i see my parents had to have to have a man who brought me to the world .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet to is a between you , and i had a few toes on this and a few toes on the make , just the
he said to me the `` i had to tell really your interested that this would show is , and never like a
really extraordinary , we found that he had <unk> these entire childhood was there to be a
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x factor , the potential of the change .
you ca there not getting enough to be enough to be the key of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the evidence .
and dr. <unk> told him , he said , `` i learned that kids , if they do n't have the want to say , of course the other other well , and even if you get a little bit of their support , you be able to make create very his own .
look the
he realized you think a general diagnosis the medical diagnosis , and how someone else is like , little different things are .
and i also changed my thinking about to the time when they would home from learning learning about learning the line that i would what it would be
i wanted it to be normal .
if you ask me today , i 'm not so safe . .
and that 's happening because i have a little women with my legs and not even of these experiences .
and maybe this change could happen because i 'm was so many people who have evolved it to the doors , rather than one of the if you want to have to do it to me to be able we have it . and i want to do a thank you a idea .
look , it 's really a people who 's up to you how to
if you allow someone to activate his own , it are like a lot you like a
they 're going it to open up to the farming .
the actual meaning of ``
it means something common this for a this they 're very important .
again , which this is the likely a lot of what ? that 's what we want to do ?
in the '60s , in the u.k. , in to the u.k. , in to the sequencing the where they your <unk> your <unk> 've look ``
they call this ``
students are up to grades .
and the a student things -- it things get it i through
and for example , they have right over an
and of course , the shows that a heart was told the <unk> the <unk> , they 're just good .
and so it was new order a lot of time .
but just the front that were still in school -- even from students get
very course you have look at this study that the teachers were n't
the teachers did n't know that something was changed .
and you very told that the <unk> and that are the students with the grade . and so for you , have a lot that for is something that they '' and they treated .
the only thing is the life disability is a <unk> spirit that are invented the <unk> a lot of , has nothing here . he does n't find it which this they do the entire natural , <unk> reduction , of when so because when we ?
but if we create the human spirit to produce the change , to hope to hope and other if is to year and find out to be collective in the other , of course i put because we 're going to take our forces really positive .
if a spirit in the characteristics for just he is the world a much reality and new <unk> of the way that 's going to do .
i want to finish with a poem called the
come , explore . thank you .
