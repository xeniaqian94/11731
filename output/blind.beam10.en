yes , good day my gentlemen .
thank you very much for inviting me here .
and i have to imagine now .
my name is christian <unk> , and i 'm strange notion of eating the city .
that 's called eight years .
and my <unk> is : first , the personal , second organization , third , the public policy .
so i 'm responsible for the <unk> of this city .
and you do n't do so popular .
i know .
and beyond that , and that 's what my son is especially , i 'm also <unk> .
this is the head of the head of the <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and i thought i thought , of course , is a topic that i want to do with you today .
and that 's the topic of the topic of <unk> , because it 's a writing system .
so we hope for the best , and i 'm going to do us on the worst thing that jack first said .
you know him .
he was at general <unk> .
and then i do n't start thinking about this .
i 'm going to give you a way .
so we talk to a risk that we 're going to stand on a disaster , for example , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
lots of people are the road .
it turns out , it <unk> .
and somewhere on the edge is a suitcase , lonely , <unk> , perhaps <unk> .
no one seems to belong .
you do n't hear the suitcase .
suddenly a <unk> .
leave the <unk> .
police , <unk> , <unk> .
people are calling .
<unk> <unk> .
go out .
because what ?
we do n't know that , or we ca n't tell it .
people leave the building .
children crying .
so some of them are even going to do because it needs to go .
suddenly a <unk> .
there is <unk> inside .
panic .
i 'm looking at here .
i have the rest of your imagination .
but it 's not a fantasy i have <unk> . <unk> ?
this is exactly what happened in this week .
there 's a suitcase .
afterwards , only in <unk> , nine of them were used to drugs .
but people were like that , and so a friend told me to <unk> the building .
it was not told .
and this was exactly this piece of place at least in the group of the group that my friend in my friend was in the friend .
thank god is not <unk> , otherwise , otherwise the whole long time it does n't <unk> out as it seems like it seems .
you can see in a <unk> disaster in a <unk> disaster , in a range of communication is a very important good job .
communication is because of communication , because people in this situation is really much more than communication .
you know what 's going on .
in the good , old time , the authorities was pretty simple .
we simply said , or we lied .
why is that ?
because this is the so-called <unk> .
you know , you 're <unk> to say , god that people get in panic , because we 're not going to say the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is a time of social media , in a time of facebook , in a time of <unk> and public health , in a time of <unk> and public tv .
and in fact , the reason is , because the first thing is because it 's not morally moral , and the second thing is , most importantly , we are , for the last thing , we 're going to be the last time for the last as a state of the event .
you may still remember the <unk> into the hudson river , that 's a few year ago .
first one is about twitter .
and from someone who was <unk> and <unk> immediately , here 's a plane <unk> and we save the people now .
this was not a <unk> .
you can see , we rely on that , and i 'm just going to be able to say the truth of the truth and really <unk> .
because of course , of course , we are , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , we are the last one that supposedly the truth of the truth of the truth because we have to be aware of the agency , of course , that we 're just sharing information .
it 's public media , or private media either do n't be able to be so much or they just do n't .
therefore , we 're going to eat in food , and this is something that has been looking at the media that we are thinking about in the future .
and we get the good old <unk> <unk> .
but only as a form of <unk> .
that 's called the next few years in the next few years of building a hundred <unk> in the <unk> , which is some of you know that if it comes to the <unk> .
it used to be that .
you know , you know , you know , what 's three times short , even short , for a short time , and at a minute .
i do n't know anymore .
we 're going to have this time to deal with all the <unk> that we have on this place , which is about twitter , about twitter , about twitter , on the radio , about tv and the local media and so forth , of course , of course , with <unk> , to get the information to get the information .
and we know , we have to be very fast , and we have to be <unk> and <unk> , because the <unk> and citizens will be <unk> .
and eventually no longer believe what we want to say .
so communication in the crisis or in disaster is a question of <unk> about all media , and it 's also a question of credibility .
the credibility is to tell our biggest problem , because the <unk> and citizens say , `` citizens , '' the <unk> <unk> , does n't tell you , or you say , it 's all worse than it is in reality .
and we have made good experiences with facebook and twitter , recently recently .
you may have taken some of them from the media .
we have a bigger <unk> in food .
and this is a chemical bomb .
these are bombs that are <unk> with a <unk> system , because the only thing that is not going to be shocked by the first <unk> on earth , but by the floor of world war , which triggered the <unk> of each other , <unk> two <unk> of each other .
the problem is only , many of these bombs have never works and be in the <unk> of food in food .
and we got from one of the old gentleman , who 's going to be a little bit like that , like so beautiful , we 're going to have been going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> , and now he had a control of the authorities , and now he 's informed the authorities in the background ,
by the way , several girls have reported in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see what we 're going to find all .
this bombs have to be a place , not <unk> , but <unk> .
and so we just put in the park in the <unk> park , in the literally sense of all the word , a bomb .
and first of the city in the city of the city , the entire communication about facebook and twitter , with the implication that the entire industrial <unk> has been <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
and the media were thrilled . there 's the background .
we did n't have to do with the telephone on the phone , but they have <unk> and <unk> , all about <unk> and twitter .
all the whole great effect for us , because the credibility is going to be <unk> about these social media .
just because you have to give me a sign when i 'm going to stop .
i ca n't look at the watch .
this is the credibility because , first of these social media have to share very information .
not so much <unk> , because the members of the <unk> or the <unk> of how you call them , a high <unk> .
second , early <unk> .
if something does n't be true , that somebody 's immediately , so that the credibility that i 've just talked about , and the whole community is involved in the principle of the reports on the upper
and it 's a very high <unk> of that , so if anything is wrong , it can be very quickly .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , the exciting thing that was a bomb on the <unk> park .
so , from all the things that has happened in the last few years , and there 's a lot more <unk> than <unk> than a white knows .
the city can eat a day of such a disaster .
a bomb , which has to be in <unk> in a park , is certainly not one .
but they can also be , and also , we 're going to be found in the <unk> , and then we 're standing there with our <unk> , and try to stay in seven feet of water .
and if the , think of <unk> , think of other cities , when the <unk> has become <unk> , because they do n't know what you do n't do a conventional game that you do n't know , then you know , a lot of them , a variety of houses after that
and that 's important to communicate , for one of the one , because it 's necessary in one in a world of <unk> speed , to do communication to do that , just to do it to do that , to do that the people have to carry that people are to carry on that difficult situation
and the social media are also helping us to be <unk> , because eventually they 're all involved in communication , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> , like we were in the <unk> , and certainly in the <unk> of the <unk> .
so today , today 's not just a task of the authorities , not just a task of <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross and communication systems , but communication in the disaster , but communication in the disaster and it 's
and <unk> showed that .
there 's a lot of twitter and around facebook , when you were <unk> , because all of people were going to build any more <unk> , and you know , you did n't know anything else .
this shows that there 's a lot to do for public communication , also for public communication in the nanoscale , but the unprecedented property of the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , of the <unk> media is that social media is not going to think of communication .
and i hope that i believe that this medium is actually actually used to be used for the beautiful things , also in <unk> of life , and that 's the way that we 're going to be used to the use of the future , to the use of the world , and the end of the world is going to be able to use the citizens , and at the end of the other people , and at the end of their own , and the end of the other people , and at the end of their own , and the end of the people , and at the end of their own , and the end of the people , and at the end of their own , and at the end of their own , and at the end of their own , and at the end of their own , and at the end of their own , and at the end of their own , and at the end of their own , and at the end of their own , and at the end of their own , and the end
thank you .
this is a beautiful good evening .
i 'm slightly different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just heard about .
and i 'm just going to do that , and i 'm just going to get a little <unk> .
what i 'm going to do is that i 'm going to produce there , and i 'm going to produce there .
before i do , i have to <unk> some things .
the first one is , i think that we really need stories to life .
we ca n't live without stories .
and also , i think that there is a lot more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories than the entertainment industry .
and i think that the internet is that the internet , in fact , in fact , actually as no <unk> is really <unk> .
and four , i 'm really convinced that people have been created to be creative .
and they are happier after they 're allowed to be creative .
the more people are happy , the better the world .
common .
this better world is now a byproduct .
first line , i 'm like , the storyteller .
and the story that i want to tell you , is going to go through midnight in a <unk> , keeping <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> birthday .
now you 're going to get out of the <unk> and crazy , because in the moment , it 's going to be going to go to midnight , something happens to her .
it happens something in your mind , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really do that .
you do n't know what 's going on .
but i have words for this .
i call this the magicians of <unk> .
you can see on the one side of the one side , and it 's pretty white .
i felt like i was quite <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other side , we put together a lot of color in the country .
and in this point , it said that i 'm going to do better and write that i 'm drawing on .
so , the first thing that 's going to see now with your new perception is a total man with <unk> hair , which is a lot of hair in front of her , and she says , <unk> congratulations .
this is <unk> .
and also , <unk> <unk> <unk> is that they heard about a very special kind of people .
she was born as <unk> .
players are people who go down to the <unk> of your <unk> , to play your lifetime .
who are you aware of them ?
nice .
imagine if you do n't get <unk> , if you meet each other , but <unk> from the pocket .
so <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all sorts of things .
what is really important , the player has no insight into your <unk> .
we do n't know when we die .
i do n't wish any long life , but we do n't know .
it can be around tomorrow .
and it 's like this to my gamers .
you do n't know about how much you can play .
again , again , every time you could have been the last minute .
a player who has a life of playfulness , <unk> in the moment of the moment as a candle being <unk> .
now , of course , you can ask , if this is so dangerous , why do they do that ?
the answer is clear that .
without play , without play , without a <unk> , <unk> , all <unk> and only if a player plays , he actually is alive .
they were born to play .
so .
this is the story of <unk> and as you 're going to <unk> the world of the player , and of course , of course , in the first challenges , and of course , in love , that 's the story i want to tell .
and this is in a form of <unk> .
the first and the first season has 12 , i 'm sorry , and i 've had a <unk> that i 've been seen late .
so , twelve follow the first season with one time of five or seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result of the other , beautiful <unk> telling you .
the tv is nothing else for his <unk> .
this is not new .
and if it would be everything , the first thing i do .
and also not at all .
but it 's just right now .
let 's go back to <unk> again .
what is the most famous sentence from the film or from the series ?
it can only be one , right .
thank you .
when we had that work .
and that 's exactly what i ca n't do that .
and there can be a lot of them .
there are so many different games .
just think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so forth and so forth .
and that 's exactly what <unk> is the number of gamers .
and it 's the amount of stories that all want everybody to tell .
now the next question : who is to tell you all ?
i already have a very high opinion of me .
i think of copies and extraordinarily creative .
but i know that a hundred brains more than one , even if it 's mine .
and therefore it came right to the idea that you 're going to <unk> the crowd into the creative process .
what if we 're not going to sponsor <unk> or allow us , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we 're going to store you very much , the development of this system that we do .
for example , for example , for example , for example , in the process of three times a <unk> , that you 're thinking about it , because he remembered them to your grandfather .
and it 's also a big fan of <unk> .
now , you can just do it with the technology today is not so hard to make a <unk> .
and this shop you 're on the <unk> , and this is really cool , which is really really cool .
that means it 's not going on , but it lands right there , right ?
the really nice is that we are in the internet .
and the internet is really going to do everything .
so each medium is somehow allowed .
this is the audience you can write , drawing what they want to do .
and let 's look at this structure .
this is a little bit of <unk> web , right ?
this is that kind of <unk> that is built together .
and i 'm really convinced that the internet was born to tell exactly the kind of stories of stories .
now , unfortunately , not so many , or no one .
so i 'm going to go now , but i 'm going to go back to the viewer for the audience .
that 's in a <unk> .
so you can go from the characters of the series , but also against people in the real environment , that also have these <unk> on your cell phone .
so , of course , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
these wonderful areas that are going to develop very rapidly .
and i ca n't go up , because i would have six minutes to do .
we just put together .
everybody 's time is three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> , and then we have the <unk> .
with this case , i could have the judges for the jury , moment , i have to see the short answer : the <unk> innovation .
so i gave me the first price of the best <unk> .
and i have to say , these <unk> insisted from <unk> banks from banks from the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so , really sensible people , should i mean .
and if i can convince the convince here , the internet is going to revolutionize the internet , <unk> structures , the world , i think i can really have to convince everyone .
so .
everybody 's time : why is this all the whole thing ?
because of this name is covered by all areas .
so , of course , of course , of course , we have the <unk> , who is it , i am it , you 're going to be , you know .
of course the die .
in the series , a lot of a lot of a lot .
each one is , everybody has to die .
and of course , everybody is in the sense of everyone in the sense of everyone if he wants to .
that 's totally important .
i come from the <unk> , and there 's nothing worse in my opinion , when it becomes a <unk> .
i do n't know if you know that .
when you 're in the theater , and then the actors comes into the auditorium and everybody says , `` oh , god , please .
and that 's not .
so it 's <unk> interaction .
and nobody needs to .
he can only be the same .
the reason why i 'm talking about german is that the whole project will be in german , first .
that 's a couple of reasons .
i 'm going to the project to the day , and i was always asked , and i was always asked , do the whole thing about english , <unk> , blah , blah .
i just say , the german <unk> is the third third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , the spanish and the german .
so now it 's not as though we 're going to move into a little <unk> area .
and i really believe i really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really believe in fact , if you 're going to be more people to be grateful for something that has not been <unk> by any <unk> , where everybody has been <unk> and every pun .
if all this is going to do this , like i would like to do it , then the first process is <unk> online .
and if you ask , why i 'm here at a <unk> , where it 's going to be under the headline <unk> <unk> .
and i did a little thought .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also pretty dependent on <unk> and <unk> .
a couple of <unk> were also <unk> and <unk> .
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly <unk> .
but it does n't do anything when you do it .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i 've just taken everything that i 've learned .
and it 's <unk> .
so far is good at all .
so i can just say .
so , if somebody thinks i think , i want to contribute to my part of my own , i had a idea of <unk> character , or i 've been making a piece of drawing , or whatever it 's already going to be already .
you find us in the internet .
on facebook .
great , how free are already talking about .
well , i 'm also <unk> .
think , you can delete memory ?
question .
you can delete memories ?
can you remember everything in your life ?
have you have more forget about this ?
who 's who can remember everything ?
they do n't go up a hands .
so you can delete memories ?
not .
thank you very much .
no , so we do n't want to do this .
then the talk would be pretty quick .
again , good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today , i chose me because he was two of my passions , or two big passions of the time .
i 've been studying <unk> , and i 've been interested in the bits of bits and bytes that are so big through the world .
and i 'm also going to have a coach and a coach and consultants in the private and the <unk> area .
so on the one side , i have a lot of difference in the computer , on the other side , i 'm on the other side of the world i 'm going on in the human <unk> of <unk> <unk> , so how does this work ?
how do you change this ?
so this is the story to present a parallel .
i was a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question : when can we do when we can build a computer that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think that we 're very close to this .
so i think about two , three hundred years , i do n't need that anymore .
but let me do why you might have a little bit more .
so the computer is between the computer on the computer and our brains on the other side .
so if we take the computer , it 's all , so your smartphone , your tablets , your <unk> , and also all these cameras and all these cameras and all smart refrigerators somewhere in <unk> little chip .
it 's called <unk> , central <unk> <unk> .
these pieces are put out of <unk> transistors .
the word is already heard of everyone , and it 's always been <unk> as a triangle .
the <unk> little device that has three <unk> , and it turns out of the stream of the stream .
in our cpu in our cpu , we have extra <unk> <unk> about five hundred million parts .
and the turn they are mixed up there .
we 're going to do things , we may have heard of albert einstein , yes , <unk> computer can do everything very much , very quickly , but in contrast .
no one can not .
it 's actually pretty bad .
we want to compare this to our brain .
our brains have been a tiny bit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have this , and we got a hundred billion , a hundred billion of neurons , so a hundred billion neurons in our cataracts .
but the beauty is , our neurons are not just three connections , but they have to <unk> a neuron .
and this is a <unk> of <unk> , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
this is 10 with 14 zeroes <unk> .
so you have the complexity of our brain is a few higher than what we have a computer .
so we want to compare that the <unk> , perhaps the first one or another one , the first supercomputer that had your own power door , ha the <unk> , and with the <unk> of the month 's campus <unk>
our <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the box takes about 20 watts .
and this is the equivalent of two big bananas , so they do n't need to do it and your computer is going up there .
now , if we 're going to <unk> a <unk> big part of this up here , <unk> <unk> good computer , why do n't we use that , why do we forget things ?
maybe the one is one or another one in the internet , the human being used to be 10 percent of your brain , buy it now to get this <unk> brain .
and <unk> there is a little bit of advertising .
ten percent is , but our brain is in the course of the evolution of the evolution , which was pretty much smaller , in the middle of all , everything else has <unk> .
that 's not going to happen because we do n't use that .
so why does that seem to make the biggest part of that ?
maybe you know the term of <unk> ?
so i think of the iceberg , and the iceberg , if you look at the iceberg , in the ocean , the top is the top of the surface , the north pole is a <unk> .
and this 10 percent <unk> , that 's about what our <unk> , our own mind is <unk> , but <unk> percent is <unk> <unk> .
we <unk> the statement of how we used to <unk> we <unk> slow motion , and we 're thinking about the creative creative .
and in order to get back to this memory , maybe the one of the people who knows one or other people with <unk> memory .
so , people who can remember a lot more detail than i did n't have seen in the situation , and the tell the tell , but i said yes , but i said , but , but , what do you know ?
this is a little bit , there 's a special , there 's a special thing called a <unk> , so someone who 's <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in a <unk> , <unk> , looking at the minimum of <unk> , looking at the tiniest airplane , so , <unk> is the <unk> of the tiniest city , has been looking at a gigantic sign of a <unk> page ,
and not somehow , this is that river , and there is this , no , every single house , every single door , every single window , every single window , he has seen , he has <unk> , he could bring it again .
where does that go ?
so why ca n't that , why can we ca n't , now , the <unk> is close to the level that the <unk> will have more access to his <unk> percent .
now we 're using that , but why ca n't i remember the <unk> night , in all the details ?
<unk> <unk> has made some interesting experiences .
so , for example , in fact , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , in the law enforcement , with a child mortality , who had been <unk> by the experience of the experience that was not to the brain , the <unk> <unk> of the brain that is not happened .
wonderful , so that was very well .
but now it went to make people <unk> .
there was a very safe session , at the end of the end , if you can bring back to this event , even if they were not going to remind you to get the screen of the car , they could <unk> the cars , which was not <unk> , that was <unk> <unk> .
and in fact , with this shot of one of the first one .
the second thing i thought was a lady in <unk> , who has told me that their mom was in the <unk> , when she was very small , as they were four years .
and she was sitting on your lap and her mom .
and then he told her , in <unk> , read this .
and then she started to read , you know , she was four than that happened , they could n't read it , you can read this .
and then they said that he said , `` tell me the <unk> .
they actually found a copy of alice in wonderland , where exactly what stood on the text that the lady was read .
so the brain has been like she was <unk> , as an image .
and they could read .
so , we do n't have access that , but we seem to have <unk> in the ordinary living in order to <unk> us .
now , we do n't store the event , but it 's like <unk> , a picture , a <unk> , we 're going to see what we 're looking at , and what we 're going to hear , what we 're going to feel like , and how they 're going to feel <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> , you know , <unk> , you know , <unk>
and it was a long night , they 're <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then i 'm going to ask them , just close your eyes .
and remember a very <unk> , positive event in the recent past , yes .
take the first thing .
and if you do this now , you may be aware that you get a visual part of this memory .
you may get a picture , maybe even a movie ?
now , some of them are not just because we do that normal , but that 's what they do for the first time .
and if you can see that , you can be either in the film , from your eyes , or how they look at yourself in a screen .
this is what we call the other <unk> .
thank you to get the thought again , to start the eyes back .
who has a visual information , so you get your hand up .
yes , there 's a few hands , and this is so much about what i would say , it 's about what i thought is , it 's actually something that we do n't do so often that we do n't know that it 's not really <unk> .
well , <unk> .
so , what 's really is wrong with memories of memories , if you get memories , you do n't have this memory , <unk> feeling <unk> , and i 've been looking at the one of the smile , and i would have been nice , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , and i think , you know , and i think , you know , and it 's the memory of
and this is what exciting .
now , it was all the time , well , all the brain does n't make any difference between what we 've actually remembered and what we just think of what we feel .
and you can try to sit down when you sit down at home and imagine something in the future that does n't happen , you will get similar information like something that was in the past .
and , you know , you know that stories that you 're talking about in <unk> round , you know .
then , hey , hey , it happens , and that 's so beautiful , and the longer the stories , the beautiful , the stories , the stories is much <unk> , there was a lot of <unk> , there was a lot of romantic , there was a lot of romantic , there 's a lot higher .
so if we do that in retrospect , so if we actually change our memories , why do n't we do this ?
<unk> , when i came here , my uncle was shown from his hut in switzerland .
a very nice picture , it 's also a very beautiful hut .
only , the picture is a little bit beautiful than the shack , so it 's an artistic freedom , so it 's called <unk> <unk> , because it 's a nice <unk> , there 's a beautiful dog on the alps , there 's a picture of the alps , that 's a picture of the wine , that 's not a picture of this hut .
and why do n't we do that with our own thoughts , our own memories , and what i do , i think that if i do that more beautiful , which i think of course .
they actually have artistic freedom in their own thought .
i mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and i did n't have <unk> , i went to the head of the head .
the whole night , and this thought did n't go back .
and i think it 's the other way he did n't make the thought .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> a little bit depressed when he came up , because his mom has remained in <unk> , and he just got them terribly missed .
what the father made , so he sat down with the son , and he said , or did what was the most beautiful , what 's happened ?
because what was the most beautiful , and then he told him what 's going to let me tell him what 's great about today .
and , in two weeks , it 's <unk> .
and then it was also okay to visit the <unk> of the visit again .
and this is the whole youth that has done about that , which is one of the most <unk> people i know .
so it 's not the memories that affect us in the way we are , but it 's our focus on which we 're using .
and how much energy we use to use it , or use it .
so if you <unk> <unk> or say , this was so ow , that 's why i mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
so , what is the <unk> , right , which is , `` well , yeah , <unk> , <unk> , '' that 's really good , man , that was beautiful , right ?
and then you take that with this .
take the <unk> and make it work .
or if you really <unk> somebody 's <unk> , it 's <unk> your boss , or your wife , or your wife , or your husband , you laugh , you laugh .
so , take this picture , put it <unk> , <unk> hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let the fall in the background , you laugh , you laugh , why do you laugh ?
because they imagine , because these things are funny .
and you can get much better with the situation .
so can man memories delete ?
no , i think our brain has so much capacity to do everything .
but it does n't matter because we can choose the capability of how much we focus on , and how important we do , a reminder , a thought of thinking , a thought of thinking about it .
so my plea for you , you 're playing with the images of your head in your head , you use the power of her <unk> and give him every day that enrich your life .
good afternoon .
thank you for inviting us .
if i 'm going to ask for a party , what i 'm doing so in my spare time and tell me that i 'm going to talk to your friends with friends and make sure , i see shining eyes , and in the minds of my audience , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
so when i 'm going to <unk> that it 's a <unk> <unk> for classical music , and this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of old people who are in the right , long <unk> and very focused on the art .
frank <unk> said to talk about music as about architecture .
and this is similar to what we do .
and they still get a insight that i 'm going to talk about , i gave you a quick film .
<unk> .
there is something that is a little <unk> of it .
this brings it from my view on the point .
the <unk> has been growing up from the <unk> of the <unk> , which is completely different .
we 're <unk> , today , in the middle of the middle , the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end , at the end
but we also have experienced that the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of us have some joy , well , a little <unk> of it .
and we are the physical belief that the crisis of classical music is not on the content of the content , so the music itself , but on their <unk> .
so we 're going to make the question that you can create a <unk> , that the music is near , the friends and this force that we like so much of them .
how can we organize a <unk> , which works beyond the <unk> of the <unk> ?
we ask the parameter that you know from the classical concert , space , light , context , basically .
take the ratio between the audience and musicians .
normally we have the stage between the stage .
we 're trying to be a <unk> .
this is a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians sitting in the audience , drink , you have a conversation in the middle of the world , playing , play , two pieces , put themselves in audience .
the whole thing is a little bit of <unk> in the evening .
everybody , which feels <unk> , goes on the stage and goes back .
or that 's in the concert .
the classic concert is that you look at more or less comfortable , better chairs , like you 're looking at here and look at the front and listen to you .
but there 's music , because you ca n't sit there .
and we did thought , how can you put this .
if you 're going to sit different and you can make a <unk> piece of music , you 're automatically listening to .
still is that we did n't have a stage , but four stages about the audience .
the audience could have been <unk> .
so , everybody was sitting on the night in the first series .
it 's important for us that we do n't just make any difference in the music that we think of music .
so that 's what we ask for the spaces and <unk> all the people need to make the music that you can work like you 're driving ?
and then we 're going to develop research on top of the night , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the s is actually just by <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in old <unk> .
but not just the spaces of the same way , and the lighting can make music and now , but also the connection with others .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been working with a few years of working with a couple of years to work with the <unk> , which is wrong with music that actually did n't have written to dance .
and so then we develop <unk> or <unk> or <unk> reich .
and we have a year in this year , yes , if you want to do that , you know .
we have a concert in the first time with a <unk> process .
we have the story of the soldiers from <unk> <unk> , dancers , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that 's mainly because of this , because we had backed a big <unk> that had backed us into this piece .
we have a lot of money on a lot of people from a lot of people from all of people that we could , so we could .
in all , this <unk> is something called a community of the community .
we 're totally happy near <unk> in the city of <unk> .
because the city is exactly the size that we 're great spaces and <unk> places for concerts , but also so small that we are known .
if the beginning of the year in the spring two weeks after the spring of the year from the spring of the year from the spring of the year in the spring of europe are <unk> in the city , then just <unk> over the city of walking around the city .
the whole <unk> is called <unk> .
we are <unk> a <unk> <unk> and students , medicine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> totally mixed .
and in order to a <unk> <unk> , that 's like the <unk> or coordination and funding in the eye , seven to 10 , seven to 10 , <unk> makers in a <unk> for a year for a year .
it 's also <unk> , but it 's a year for example , for example , the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> are in real hands and to <unk> the <unk> .
we do all in our time and live in the <unk> .
that means that the biggest part of the work is <unk> , and on a <unk> .
only three times in the year , we get distributed to a <unk> weekend , <unk> , <unk> , the one of the issues that have arrived , and the human being , which is just incredibly important when you want to be profoundly concerned about it .
then , the <unk> of the <unk> will come back to 30 , <unk> <unk> , or a few weeks for a few weeks or a few weeks to get their hands , and they touch where help , with <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk>
and of course , of course , in these 14 days of the musicians coming up .
now you could have my plan that you have to have a <unk> <unk> .
but our <unk> still continues .
so , we have a big community in the city of the city that we 've built around us to do that what we want to do .
that 's going to go out of the classic <unk> , which is also about practical things like , for example , for example , because we have a baker , which is about bread or a <unk> , who 's building fresh food .
the <unk> is being made in the city about the whole year .
until the <unk> .
we have found a whole range of plants that are available to the living room for the musicians there .
and in this way , the <unk> has become something in the city , and the people in this city .
they 're going to identify in a very special way of <unk> .
so , for the beginning of the year , thanks very much to the citizens from the citizens from a place to call a <unk> , which is the whole endeavor on a <unk> and a reliable <unk> .
we are makers from the stage that classical music is going to do , and they get it from the right hands .
that 's why we are incredibly happy about that in very europe , that in europe , young musicians into their own hand and home in the cities .
now , if you ca n't imagine the same way that feels like this , classical music , you 're just getting over .
and this next year we are back in <unk> , and we would look , when they are there .
ladies and gentlemen .
you may have a <unk> .
knowledge is learning to learn to the effect of learning , but i mean , i think , learning <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you know , the experience of experience is a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
so what i 've learned from art and culture , now , i can say a lot of course , because now ar <unk> <unk> i 'm in this field .
and that 's why i thought it would be right to be a little bit of title of a different <unk> of what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , but it 's much work .
you have a laugh now .
you always see laughter , even though most of the mention .
why is that ?
i think this has to do that in the word of the word beautiful , what we ca n't grasp .
art , and we sometimes say that .
in the work , we say that what is .
sometimes .
people who likes to work that for me .
but work , we 're more likely to think about the realm of everyday life , where we move our own experiences , our own ideas .
and so i 've shared my <unk> that i 've had to share with about three hours in five settings , and that 's what it all begins with it .
it starts with the <unk> time , for the childhood , i 'm going to go to inspiration for my youth , i 'm not going to tell you all of my youth , you 're not <unk> , i 'll explain why i took this for my <unk> .
the interaction for the first part of my professional life , and finally , five , identification .
<unk> of them will have this pieces of sebastian <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> .
you learn it that in the first two , three years when you 're going to <unk> , and i 've been working on .
and so for 10 , 11 pieces , i played this little pieces , on the piano , not far from here , on the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of a <unk> is a <unk> .
there 's a melody and the other voice <unk> , but it 's very different .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and ladies and gentlemen , is a little <unk> of the art that it 's going to do , and when there are only two voices , together , together , the future , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , the past , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> , things that are together ,
and i 've learned this , two melodies , sometimes in the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , in the same time , but to hear a kind of <unk> , the other people .
that 's what i 've learned , among other things .
now , another experience i 've never forget , and i had to have the worry that maybe i could do today .
i have a piano <unk> , it was more people in the room than today , and in the middle of the <unk> , i came out .
i had forgotten it .
i 've been played .
so again , again , i did n't know that same time again .
the audience has more <unk> more than i was , because i went into a place , came my notes , put it back and started the third time .
and they do n't believe that i 've got behind me .
but this was a very severe experience .
maybe that was also one of the experiences that i knew , well , even though i had a little <unk> , but i would n't have to walk my <unk> , because you do n't get easier .
yes , the next part of my adolescence i 've been <unk> with inspiration and i want to tell you stories .
so when i was so <unk> , i went to my <unk> , and told him , <unk> , i 'd like to play a <unk> .
and he said , oliver , that does n't .
there 's a lot of <unk> that have been visited and collected lots of experience with women .
now , imagine a <unk> boy , so young , a sentence .
and i did n't forget .
and i have that more <unk> , of course .
and i was off , and i was in a <unk> .
i 've raised with a situation that i 've never experienced more .
it was the <unk> of the chopin of chopin , and now i get to the part of the work , and it was just the most beautiful place , and they had to do the poor , and then they went back and back .
now , i ca n't think it 's not a piano , and i could n't do it anymore .
i 've got this point , and i played 30 times , and suddenly suddenly came right .
and then i was playing her , and i was played out of the <unk> , and i just know i was crying and laughed at the floor .
i was again .
i did n't have nothing to do n't have nothing , and the music has done this .
and i have a experience where i 've learned to do emotions .
and sometimes it 's also right to work that you 're in these types of <unk> , in this condition , i 'll call it , the <unk> .
where all of themselves is walking .
we actually had this situation in the <unk> of <unk> in a organization .
there 's almost all like any of yourself , when we made the <unk> , it took a half months of where you would have a year to need .
well , this was my experience with artistic with artistic work .
and now i get a student , <unk> .
i first had a musician , but just as a <unk> .
we played <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and i gave me a couple of time and i have so much next to my <unk> for the music to continue and had this <unk> .
in choir , in the choir , <unk> , a <unk> sing , wonderful experiences that are very , very <unk> .
and then a point where i went into the <unk> theater , in the <unk> , and the celebrity , and i 've been able to <unk> this chapter , because this notion came from , from this combination of art , culture , i was in the time of art , and i was in the time that i was in the <unk> of the <unk>
and that 's the art of making culture to make my <unk> .
so here 's the art for the art , but not as an artist , but they would n't be able to say , but as a <unk> , and continue to do something .
i was there in the theater , and there were no <unk> in germany , and i 'm <unk> in vienna , and i 've always deal with the question to do with this question to improve art , to improve art for art for art for art to build a good management of art ?
and that was the reason why i did n't stop in my workforce , in the direction of this business , and i was then <unk> .
but in fact , it was another <unk> , and this stage i 've got to interact with .
<unk> came to german <unk> .
the german <unk> has his <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , even if i was born in my resume , because i was born , because i was born in <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , i 've got to <unk> that , i have to sort of <unk> this .
but i have a <unk> root , because my maternal maternal community were also <unk> , and in <unk> , i experienced the <unk> .
this was a little bit of what i did n't enjoy this , and suddenly i 've been immersed in a different form of culture , in a culture , a culture that lived by people in this <unk> device .
once the <unk> of us , all of us were all in a very different situation , in very different states .
and i have <unk> with <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> and my friend , and i always have been making music for the <unk> night , and i was playing , and i was playing with the piano , and i was playing with the piano , and for example , i was feeling a different <unk> dance , for example , i was <unk> <unk> .
we did the <unk> <unk> , so , of course , but of course of the texts of the <unk> <unk> , months <unk> .
and this <unk> that really came out of people .
and my fate was my fate i learned from november <unk> for my <unk> , and i did n't know the wall fell .
i was in the next day , i had the conclusion , oh , the wall is like , yes .
just for me just quickly thinking about any questions for a question .
and off , i was <unk> in the city of the cities .
and i experienced this interaction like interactions like interactions with two germans .
in fact , we 're talking to the same language that 's going to be beautiful and became wonderful , but lots of <unk> , <unk> .
in fact , unlike the <unk> , it did n't have all kinds of people , and it came from the top of the top , and that 's what i really felt like , like the german identity , that i would go back to the same and german <unk> and german <unk>
since , germany is <unk> .
since the more <unk> is much more <unk> places .
i learned what i 've learned from all the things that i 've experienced in the city .
so , we have a <unk> , and i thought , when i started here , <unk> , on my <unk> , on culture and leisure .
i still have that .
they stood for <unk> , you did n't write write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
and i was the first director of the <unk> .
so i did n't have a lot of time , well , i was so wonderful that i had this <unk> , but they would go and disappeared , because i was going to do for education , and it could make alliances to education
we 've done a lot of urban development , we 've only see this <unk> between the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> where we can experience interactions between art and architecture , from the <unk> <unk>
so many , many interactions , we could design , and i 've experienced i experienced and discovered what that means when different people are pursuing out of different areas together .
by the way , by the way , that i 'm always more <unk> of the art of art , always more to culture that the <unk> of cultures , between cultures , and i say , and i get back to the art .
and the interaction was also between the <unk> of the topic that we , <unk> , seven <unk> of january , <unk> , the <unk> could apply the <unk> of europe .
but this last chapter , this one was the headline of the headline .
this word has two meanings , and i <unk> me on something , and i can also use it as a verb , and i can say , `` i 'm going to <unk> something , i mean , i mean .
and that 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , therefore i say i 'm going to say you or the community .
and i <unk> something if i 'm going to <unk> me and say that i would like to identify with me .
and this is a big action .
five process three million people are trying to move , to move , <unk> cities , to identify at the idea of thinking about the world , to <unk> and recognize that you 're in europe is in europe .
so as a big , we called <unk> , but anyway , as a community of many people who live in a big <unk> , and yet a common language , as well nations are here , and this was our primary function , and of course , of course , and of course , of course ,
and the signs , in the <unk> of the highway , many other things .
i did n't have a experience of <unk> , not so many people .
there were <unk> <unk> and food , two schools , <unk> , young girls from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from <unk> , and young students from a <unk> school , and young students from a <unk> school , the <unk> of people , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , love , love , love , who wrote the last letter .
and it has been a special effect that young letters letters from boys and young russians from young men in germany .
and there was one of those young men in the piano and playing this <unk> that i loved .
and in fact , he quoted out of a letter , and i 'm <unk> , he wrote him home , he wrote him home , that he was playing , and i can never play a more <unk> , because my two fingers are just <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger with a <unk> , put back to the piano , and tried to play the <unk> <unk> .
and it did n't have .
it was like a <unk> scene for me to go to the front of us , and i said , what did we have learned ?
we 've learned to have a lot of people involved in the way that many people can move together , but in all of all kinds of things we have learned that we are living in peace , and the culture is that we do n't get the minds that we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get us feel
and this was a wonderful experience and you see , it 's not just about learning to know .
it 's always learning about experiencing something and <unk> .
and if we invent a lot of invent , when we allow us to get us from art and culture , our own position , when we are interacting with our own identity , and ultimately , we 're going to do with art , and
and i hope that they still have a lot of <unk> and <unk> of which they pull this profit .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
i think we 're waiting for the first picture .
so i 've got to <unk> the memory of my memory in my daily <unk> .
but it 's not a scientific slides , but it 's about my <unk> here , to find a direction , and <unk> me , where i think that 's going to affect the next years .
now , i finally know the <unk> words , thank you very much for what ted is , and i think that we can see in a domain , we can actually make this talk .
and then i had heard that you should be able to keep the talk to english , but if you look at this , you would n't see what i wanted to say to english , i did n't know what i should say , and so i left the talk to german .
how we will die .
and i have to tell you about <unk> .
<unk> was in the hospital where i was the <unk> <unk> , and she was <unk> .
she was over <unk> years old , and she likes to dance into may because they remembered the first man who was like in the first man .
and so it 's the first year to the first may dance to the first of the dance , and it 's a long <unk> , and probably then <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> and <unk> on the right side , and you see the leg broken , the leg , the leg .
there was a couple of years before she was <unk> and had the same way , even the left leg .
and then i had a doctor and a doctor and have experienced how she was treated at the intensive care unit , as she was treated with antibiotics , and i 've been able to have the discussion of the world , because this is the way that it said ,
does it make sense in the same old people to get a intense process of <unk> ?
so anyway , to <unk> , at the intensive weeks , is that a human being in all ?
and she was cured of .
five years later , i 'll come in the clinic , and the name is the name , and i ca n't realize that because he 's so rare for the time , and he had broken the dance back to the other leg .
so the question is , what do i mean , if i 'm going to talk about how to talk about how a person is to decide what he writes into his directives , or what he 's going to be <unk> ?
and this is a little bit of the issue of <unk> .
you can see the <unk> of how we die .
it 's a book from <unk> , like we 're going to work , a report on the <unk> .
and then it was so the globalization was very strong that you have asked , how can it go to work with each other ?
and then , you know , you can read this book , and you can read this book , you know , you 're going to come to a quality of quality that they get into the parts .
it will be a <unk> of the successes , it will be much more <unk> , for example , this was a big topic .
and that 's like that , basically that 's basically the work of the individual , so something that has made something to make something that has been <unk> , because it became less <unk> that he 's always controlled by the quality that he <unk> from the path .
and that , because of my mind that people were always disconnected from their work and more part of one small <unk> , where it went to achieve high levels of <unk> , and not more about his work .
and if we 're going to transmit this now on the <unk> and a medical area , there is that one of the progress that is like this .
if you hear in the tv , what doctors , caregivers and <unk> , it 's the so-called <unk> .
and that 's not something else that 's going to be documented , which has to document what you 've done , so it 's going to be paid for it , and if not documented , the medical service says , you know , the medical service says , these care or those medical treatment , we do n't pay .
and what 's going to look at the <unk> is the work of <unk> and more <unk> and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of this thought , that you add up your work , and with use of personal belief in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , in the background , to such a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me went to holland because he did n't want that this one , who had a <unk> practice , and it went to the netherlands to become the doctor 's office .
the <unk> are most of these developments in the most part of the developments , and he 's looking at a piece of <unk> , and he had the martin , but it has been <unk> that more old people are <unk> between the <unk> , hospital , and back , because the <unk> is not going to do when people
then they will come into the hospital , will be restored to the <unk> , or <unk> , and will continue there .
and this community was thinking , if there is something <unk> in the netherlands , i 'd like to make some move to this one of that vicious cycle of <unk> and also <unk> <unk> .
now , in the road , he had to come in the netherlands , after he had learned the language that was really the same thing that was happening in this <unk> .
it 's also being sucked into dying of dying .
it 's no longer the credibility that counts , but it 's a <unk> , i want to be used for example , or not in the hospital , if i 'm in the hospital .
and then this becomes the freespeech ecosystem .
so in the third days , a conversation is going to find a conversation in the third days , and then you have to put in the hospital , i want to go into the hospital , or i do n't want to go into the hospital if something happens .
that 's exactly the same thing that i want , or i do n't want to be here .
this is the next part of a central part and there 's this doctor in <unk> , and it 's always the decision , and then they make the decision on this <unk> .
now , if we 're going to look at <unk> , and i 'd like to be <unk> in the may end , and we thought that would have a submit , and i would want to be <unk> , and then you 'd be able to be a second dance , and then you would have a <unk> dance ,
and this raises my friend who is sitting in the netherlands , too much more sinister , as he 's supposed to deal with this .
in the last one , that <unk> today is about seven times more than seven times more than in hospitals , but in hospitals , and that this institute , you can see that , but it 's lots of interest in the world , and it 's often deeply <unk> , and for this case , for the perception of the perception , instead of
there is a lot of homes that are very good , which is very good , there are very <unk> people in that , but if i look at the <unk> , and we have about the <unk> of the year , i would say , i would say , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , i would say to me , and i would say to me , i would say to me , and i would say to me , i would say to me , and i would say to me , i would say to me , and i would say it 's very difficult
all of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , that 's obvious reasons , that
this is not just reality today , but you need two salaries in the <unk> and <unk> , and most importantly , it 's just enough .
this is the process of quality of quality of the system of a constantly developing , so that 's what you want to regulate , so on the individual of those people .
and i 'm going to come to how to get away from the way , so what we 're going to do in the last , because i 've been asking for the first thing , and that 's what the situation is not the situation of affected .
and i just have the <unk> of the <unk> , and i 've been <unk> that , because i think , a society has to need that structures , also the legal structures that we 're going to do that in our society .
and in the <unk> article , it 's the person that would be <unk> .
and the second sentence is to protect you to protect your <unk> .
and what i do is , and the third one is there is that each individual has to have the assignment to protect and defend his dignity .
because that 's a way of <unk> out of the case of this case , i 'll give that one of the way , and i give me a kind of identification , and then i do n't have a thought of how i 'll die .
because the last thing is , though , when we do n't like to ask us this topic , we will come on the point .
hopefully even late , with a hundred or <unk> .
that 's the job that i want to say , of course , i want to say that , the wish i want to do , and i want to be worrying about the issues , but if you have to ask , you know , if you 're going to be <unk> or <unk> , it can be late in life , and i want to be late in life , and i want to be late in life , and i want to be late in life , and i want to be late in life , and i want to be late in life , and i want to be late in life .
now , if you think about what 's going on , you will come on the next step , which is actually the five most important things in my life ?
there 's a book , which is pretty <unk> <unk> .
so , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , it 's the friends that i 've been able to talk to me to talk to me and share with me and get me through life , they are the <unk> .
it 's safe between people that i may also have to do with the <unk> or <unk> area or a minister of the world , or the blink of which i get in relationship .
and there are lots of individual factors that <unk> there , i do n't go through all .
but if you look at these three steps , you know , you have a whole lot of jobs , like you might have to <unk> in life to protect your own dignity .
and then there 's another factor that we 're going to experience a certain dictatorship of the <unk> , and i 've got this one here as an example .
other people can give us these decisions and this behavior , which is not meeting .
this is my inner belief .
our dignity can come from itself .
so it 's not the question , what 's going to do because others will do that , for me , for me , for me , or for me , for me , for me ?
it 's exactly the other way , where i can ask , where i can move to people , where i can do , where i could get to the inside of these things that i can deal with this questions with this questions with these questions , and it can be able to deal with it there and do it .
and if you 're going to go to work , so this internal quality that was put up from the outside of the outside , it 's a way to say , i would <unk> me from my neighborhood to escape this mechanism .
because no human being can me , like i want to see and the <unk> .
and i do n't have to get involved in general <unk> or opinion that you have to say , you 're going to be a <unk> <unk> , and because you 've got the old , i 'm going to play whether you 're going to be in intensive care .
and this is what i 'm going to talk about the last of the last few <unk> is probably <unk> .
this would be a inner delta , which is a inner posture that can be in me , and that ca n't protect the state of the state that the state ca n't protect the state , and that 's also going to be more <unk> , and i 'm going to be more likely to have that on the ones that have been on the ones that i 've been looking at the same time that i 've been
and in order to lead those conversations , it takes spaces , and i think i 've called this talk , and this is what i 've got to eat such a picture of food , and that 's what we have to think about these things that we do n't really think about these things that maybe not is a conversation
so with that , when we 're old , you can say , well , pretty much , so a dance in may , in my may , despite my may , despite a very high age that would be even more .
i thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i get two things .
if you 're a first part of flat , you keep a little bit <unk> .
it 's a second one .
let 's start with infinite infinite .
that 's stupid , it 's not .
what do you mean ?
is there is different types of spiders ?
or is infinite enough ?
yeah .
that 's not good , if one is here , what 's looking at .
so , in fact , but i just got it off to the answer that you know .
that 's exactly what we do .
we just engage with a single one .
and i would like to limit a little off to an identity .
<unk> , we know , we know , we 're able to think of infinite possibility .
and it 's about the <unk> of the orders of scales .
when we are in the finite road , and count two <unk> , for example , in the other people .
we know that already , already , we 're looking for the box that are small , it 's three chairs , and it 's three people .
we can check it in every lot of the same amount of times ?
count how would we do it ?
that means , we would only mean , one , one , two , two , we have three , we count , three chairs , one , two , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three
that 's what i mean , right ?
nice .
this works in the <unk> , even in large numbers , even though it <unk> .
but it fits .
how do you count it ?
how do you know how many people like <unk> ?
i have aware of chairs and people did n't know what else .
<unk> .
it 's called mate .
well , you do n't do that , not , right now , we 're in the day , and i 've all experienced that !
not a nice thing .
so , it 's called <unk> a <unk> , and it works , right ?
you take a guy , put it on a chair , from the mouse .
the next question , the next day , the next <unk> , all of it , all of them is a lot of different chairs , no chair , no chair , no chair , and the amounts of all are big , okay ?
now let 's go into infinity .
how can we look at two dynamics ?
we would say that one is so big or bigger than the other .
we could do it ?
we would start starting to start .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is that when you 're going to have a infinitely long amount of long , yeah , i 'll just say they 're not coming to others .
<unk> , infinite , clear , <unk> ?
so how does it go ?
boy : <unk> ?
no way , <unk> !
she was really started .
mate !
so , let 's look at this .
appreciate it is too bad , right ?
you do n't see yes , right ?
the point is that you make it easy .
for example , when i take the <unk> , natural numbers , <unk> , we need computers , zero , zero , zero , two , two , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , five , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four , four
and we would have , say that a copy of this <unk> , and take the identity of the most <unk> numbers .
right now , you 're just pay , okay , zero , zero , two , four , eight , eight , <unk> .
okay ?
all the straight numbers are <unk> on the infinite long <unk> of the natural <unk> , but on the one <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , on the other are the line on the other , on the other and the <unk> <unk> , okay ?
we call the a lot of g the straight line , we call the other amount of <unk> the natural numbers .
what do you think ?
is g <unk> is bigger than <unk> or smaller or smaller ?
right ?
but this is very , yes , yes , the lack of <unk> .
who is another estimate ?
smaller ?
who says bigger ?
ah , that 's no plan , right ?
that ca n't be , right ?
you ca n't , where what is missing , it does n't go , <unk> ?
okay , you say , smaller ?
would you guess ?
that 's the popular thing you 're going to find is wrong .
and now i 'm going to explain why the <unk> are .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we mate .
that 's the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the linear crowd , we take the zero from the natural amount of water , mate , out .
the next one of the zero , after two , two , after zero , after zero is one , one one , and i 'll get a <unk> again .
the four , the three , the three , the eight , yeah ?
you can turn that , it 's doubling , that 's clear , <unk> ?
and it 's completely clear through the <unk> is that i 'm going to create a <unk> in the lecture .
and one , there 's just the linear on it , and the band is a second , right ?
we <unk> the natural world , <unk> , the <unk> , and the band are still equal .
this is just a infinite thing .
so if you 've learned what we 've learned today , <unk> , what 's infinity , i just know ?
there 's a infinite property that 's not a property that is not in the <unk> , and that property is absolute <unk> , a real <unk> , which is exactly the size .
it 's not going to do this , if you <unk> two three people , and it 's only one of them , and they were three .
yes , that 's what we did .
no <unk> ?
okay .
then we do another part of probability .
the professionals , there is a certain probability of probability .
here 's what i brought .
in this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's going to be at least at least a third of the time , and i have someone who does n't do that , right ?
so , let 's call the doors a , b , c .
i 'm hiding behind anything , i hope you do n't hear it .
and you 're supposed to do that first .
where you , i made something behind a , b or c ?
well , what this is , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate c .
who has another idea ?
a ?
who has one idea ?
okay , <unk> , b , b is missing , does n't , otherwise , <unk> ?
this is right .
it 's really no matter , so you do n't have to do that three letters will fall , and i 'm looking at me .
it does n't matter , yes ?
it 's completely clear because , because that 's the chance that you 've been going to be lucky , is it 's only one of the third .
<unk> , there are three things , it 's really no matter , right ?
now , i 'm going to do that , i just do one .
well , of course , i know where it 's .
<unk> , that 's somebody one , <unk> .
so , i know , where it 's because it 's , and the guess what it is , or whatever you call it , it 's called a second round .
so i 'm really the game that i 'm going to explain to the game now , now i 'm just going to be <unk> .
so it 's like we go into a second round .
now , suppose i 'm going to <unk> me on the <unk> ?
so , i have to show you a door behind it 's not because they did n't say .
because if you say b , and i say , `` i know it 's not behind b .
then there would be no second round .
and i say , `` <unk> , from the mouse , <unk> .
but i have to do this , this is <unk> , in the second round .
so i can only do a website behind it , but what you do n't have to say .
now the question is , and that 's a greater probability of the condition of the condition , under the condition that b is open , and it 's not behind you , you have their final opportunity to guess .
you get to stay at a stay , i 'm going to make a <unk> .
i do that what you want .
or you say , i do c .
now , the <unk> is now getting more likely to do ?
phew , very nice , b is on , now i know it 's behind c .
or , but , well , god is that b has been open , i always wanted to stay with a stay .
or if you 're going to say , it 's <unk> , we have <unk> , we have just two doors , it does n't matter or stay .
what do you mean ?
it does n't matter .
<unk> .
why does n't matter ?
nice .
why is it <unk> ?
yes , that 's wrong .
that 's pretty much when we had yesterday , <unk> ?
but they are , <unk> , are a new no , fun .
so , the thing that is really <unk> , yes .
that 's all the understanding of , i do n't know , six and , yes , i ca n't be <unk> , otherwise , <unk> ?
so it 's really going to get everybody .
behind this door is to a third .
and it 's always a third behind a door .
you can guess what they want to have you with two thirds of you .
that means , you ca n't have on two doors , not , you can do with two dozen times , it 's yes , it 's yes , <unk> , if you <unk> the zero times , and you know it 's all in the right life .
but we just have a door .
this is now , so , two thirds is not what you guess .
so this is two thirds here , but it can be just behind a door !
behind it 's not .
so what 's more likely ?
no way , i really <unk> .
so what 's more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or change ?
now it 's easy , right ?
yes , of course .
so , that 's not difficult , <unk> ?
ha !
what do we see ?
you have more handsome .
why is that ?
simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between theory and practice .
so i hope it was that .
thank you very much .
mr. <unk> , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is just about bad diet and bad food and bad people , and overweight people has reported that depressed .
but i mean , my best thing that that 's going to go back to this again , these experiences .
because i 'm going to come from <unk> farm , and i knew 12 , no mcdonald 's not .
that 's for the time , exactly .
yes , yes .
thank you for inviting us .
i have been raised near .
and i do n't know if mr. <unk> came on to ask me if i want to talk to ted , and talk about a particular topic .
i have <unk> <unk> : the theme of trust .
sure , motivation does not be bad and i 'm going to <unk> me the woman who said , perhaps , may have a <unk> or another .
and i also have this too .
so tonight today would be going to go to the rain now , but i have to train tomorrow , because i have to go to three weeks of june 5 , from <unk> , <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
i 'm going to go to me tomorrow , not going to fix the training .
so who wants to get <unk> , <unk> , goes early in the morning , i put it all very much .
i 've already told , briefly , i 'm going to keep up with trust the issues .
and i started , extra , with the issue .
not a worry of <unk> , little <unk> , blind trust and <unk> afterwards .
i had just got a little thought about when i 'm <unk> , how i 'll just describe what i 'm going to do ?
so , i come from half feet with six houses , lots of <unk> , a few <unk> , and in my parents , there 's apple apples , and what you do from <unk> : beer .
trust , in the sport , of course , not in the <unk> , but <unk> and beer .
why do i tell the story where i 'm from ?
for me , one of the most important stories is that i really get the right out of the country from the village , and i grew up with two large brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> .
and with the second brother , the same <unk> is like me .
this is , which is bright and dark , which can just see , like i know , like the <unk> window in the room , whether it 's light or from .
which is very convenient to the <unk> of the <unk> .
the ones , or we both see if we can see something like something .
<unk> <unk> , but i always tell you , `` i ca n't know , is <unk> <unk> .
the old men , <unk> .
it 's always <unk> .
and what 's always the most important thing is , of course , of course , the fact is the fact that `` well , you know , just like this , you know , you know , this big trust , that 's what we all need to need , we all need a little bit more <unk> situation , i think .
and that was definitely for my parents that they knew how many of you , my brother and me knew no blind .
we were so the first ones that are relatively suddenly in your life .
and then they had to do that out of the situation .
and now , i 'm going to get a lot of happiness that my parents had no day for us to stand on us , and to go on the hand , and say , because there 's <unk> wall , because you can feel <unk> <unk> .
a would have been awkward -- we have home .
and b , with our parents from the beginning of us to go to go and go anywhere , and our <unk> brother is .
so , in the house alone , the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
there 's the blind brother then <unk> me on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> that has been <unk> to today .
this is the big brothers -- that 's not just good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brothers and my brothers , and i really do so ham on the <unk> , and i really do n't make everything out of what we could do , all of the <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> brother started asking for three years with three years , and of course we wanted -- michael and i .
and then we started to drive with <unk> , like the early little children , today , the <unk> <unk> will be <unk> .
until the <unk> .
but we still started that with <unk> , at some point of time .
and then the big question is : how does the <unk> ma ?
and how do you do this , on the one hand , the parents that the parents that children , that the kids are at <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and the trust of us is that we ca n't be permanently .
and our solution was , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course
and we had to interact in between , on the one hand , but the other hand is to listen to the other .
and you ca n't all the test , because it 's going to be so loud , that they do n't have any more of them .
but <unk> , if you 're going to turn up light , you know , in your bedroom , or they want to orient in their bedroom .
can you try to develop <unk> <unk> with the tongue and be able to be able to be able to distinguish people as well as humans -- they will hear a resistance .
so as the bats that the bats are being used to hear about <unk> , now , <unk> <unk> is because the sound is just different .
and that 's for me for trust , and i think , and i have faith in the motion .
but also , the high <unk> , and the safety of security : i have a <unk> chance to help me get <unk> .
and i just like to interact with a lot of difficulty , and it 's clear , even without a lot of accidents , one or another one .
i do n't know what i do n't have any images today , which is what i 'm very <unk> about one of our <unk> as children .
because of the climb of our climb , on our higher buildings on a <unk> .
i wrote the confidence that 's growing through a <unk> diversity .
and i have a literally kind of literally , because i have a person who have been too much later in the <unk> and in the <unk> of faith in the science of trust that i 've never heard about it , or am i never experienced this as i 've experienced it .
i would never read the same read in the same way .
but would be able to do that , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course .
diversity is in the phenomenon of our strengths with <unk> , to know where i am good , what i did i mean , and where i can do my strength really <unk> ?
and our brother just goes back , who has michael and kept me on the <unk> of the house .
so then we said , okay , we <unk> a <unk> here .
there 's somewhere somewhere else from the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the <unk> went on , michael <unk> , and i ca n't have a little bit about <unk> just the girl : <unk> <unk> , i do n't know .
but finally , who 's going to end up ?
so i do n't .
and i think the other , we are the generation of young women here , not .
and that 's why i still have .
and then , you know , the implication of the time we were going to do all three <unk> <unk> walked up , and the dad would have half <unk> <unk> , and we did n't know what he 's supposed to say .
because of trust , of course , if there is other doubt .
so the father would say , to god , help help help help help the danger of us have been <unk> by fear and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i do n't know .
it never happens .
and then he had to be like <unk> that he had just <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> that has returned to us .
and i thought i was very great that we had that capability .
but clear , not a worry , that 's no power to make them later .
for me , the different sports who were always important in my life , all , interesting .
and in fact , they were all of that , because i could just see what i did , what are my <unk> .
so i could never have the good news for <unk> .
i never had the <unk> .
and i do n't like to go to today .
i 'm going to go out to look at rain .
not even at five degrees , right ?
and in <unk> rain , rain -- but still rather than inside .
but i always discovered that , and i discovered that i tried to get different <unk> .
for example , for example , <unk> .
and that was very nice for me because there 's also the instructor who had been in the <unk> , said , ok , we have <unk> kids , but send them back to us some blind children .
in fact , it 's good , because you 're going to turn to each other , you 're going to play each other .
and then you realize what the other power is .
and there 's always the big trust , of course , , of course , if i 'm going to leave the competition for a long time , because the other things i can do .
so there 's only one way , and this is the trust in my <unk> .
the other one will take a foot in the <unk> , let me go back in the <unk> , and then it 's back , and the competition is over , because it 's the full score .
i do n't try it out .
and i thought i was thinking about <unk> .
i think this is a little bit problematic now .
and i did n't have no volunteer here , right ?
<unk> .
warm , i already <unk> .
okay .
the next for me was the role of school as a <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home , or they 're taught by today , and they have taught us as children .
but for me , in my school , i know , as i do n't know , how can i move to school for school to get rid of my excess energy ?
and there was a way that i had to make a kind of opportunity for school .
and even though i thought that 's all <unk> boring , because <unk> is something like this for the <unk> , i 'm going to do .
i used to find out -- <unk> i do n't do today .
and then i said , `` well , well , i do with the <unk> .
and then the first thing that has discovered , the person , again , this is the big diversity here in the sports , because you need <unk> , and you need power , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- they have probably realized a lot of work ?
that 's exactly this in the <unk> .
you 're just going to only get the full trust in your technology .
so if you have the trust in your own power -- the force you have the same thing that you do , you know , the bad weather , with soft snow , the <unk> snow can get to mount snow .
and if you do n't trust in my case .
because the <unk> that does n't see anything , of course , i 'm dependent on <unk> .
and i never is never going to see that kind of time , like today -- i have to use the word -- my <unk> -- there 's only one -- has already done my exercise .
do n't we do it again .
and i 'll just know about it now .
just one , one of you , one of them would give you another exercise .
so what i always do is to do the topic of <unk> , that 's the exercise that i 'm going to talk about the listener is just like it 's like , if you do n't look at it , you know , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : you have two sticks in the hand .
so from the way , i do n't know , and i ca n't give you a hand , otherwise , i could take my name , and it could feel the <unk> of them .
not .
so i have to help me differently .
i then got my <unk> that i 'm going on .
and that tells me the voice .
so you just have to get the exact same thing .
and also , that 's important for trust .
the precision in communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> of the <unk> is always <unk> , if it 's <unk> , that says me <unk> , the left on the left , i know it 's easy to the left , so the <unk> of the <unk> watch .
if he says , on the left of 10 , on the left of the left , and when he says , right on the right .
okay , everybody understood ?
then <unk> problem , because i have to do it again , or he has to <unk> me , i know everybody knows , right now .
and for me , this is really big , essential , if the <unk> i 'm running out of me , i have to totally totally completely <unk> the same time .
in order to say it 's positive : he 's the tools that enables me to be very quickly , and they 're actually making it just faster and <unk> faster than the same competition .
and that 's just what i can just do when i 'm just going to do that with two poor people to stand up , and i really have to do the eyes , and i really have to do it , <unk> -- or ca n't open it .
and you have to get that kind of <unk> , and you have to go on the other leg and you can get a little bottle , but it has to be done .
<unk> .
yes , and that 's the most important thing for me , when i 'm just when i 'm going to talk about the guy , so i 'm going to tell you the guy that i had just like men , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you have to do the right <unk> , because the right thing that 's
so i do n't know what to me tell me .
so i have the way to play the way to communication .
and this is like everybody <unk> .
if somebody does n't know my needs , , of course , i ca n't help me , but i have to ask me , well , i need to say , `` well , i need to get the curve , ''
or i get a lot of you like now , when i 'm going to say , you know , like the mountain , because if we look at the mountain , because if we get the <unk> , you know , you have to be over .
and in fact , it 's <unk> like <unk> and the thing .
and i think i have a chance of the pilot that 's called the pilot called your mask , and then we have told me , because we may have been <unk> minutes , and then they 're just <unk>
so that 's for me for me for me to deal with me , because the things that i have to have <unk> <unk> .
i hear <unk> -- there 's the other thing that will drive to <unk> <unk> ?
who is more ?
so my best time was faster , but this was so april , may i 've never heard about it so much faster than <unk> .
and at the point of the moment , the moment of <unk> .
and for me , like , these things are just possible if i just get my ears in the same .
but the other thing i just tell you what he looks like , and i have the opportunity to do my risks .
and this is one of the important things that i say , trust is more training and not that <unk> .
so , look at the way of the blind , frankly , <unk> .
because i had the experience that i had a <unk> right on the right and left wrong .
and then the competition was bad because it 's next to three feet <unk> .
and i 'm just <unk> the three feet .
so , like , like , that was that , of course , <unk> .
and i know , i know , because the <unk> , you know , you have to turn to <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm going to cope with me that people say : the left and say , `` the other left .
so it was the right , unfortunately .
it does n't have a lot of life on the day .
but that , in <unk> situation with pressure , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , all of the work as well as you have to go to college .
and of course , of course , it 's obvious , of course , much more difficult challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` trust trust is that i have to know the risks .
and i have to say , i 'm as a person who does n't see , relatively big in the advantage , because i 'm <unk> my risks in many ways .
so in the <unk> , i 'm going to all <unk> all of them .
from the driving tree , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which i know , and i know , `` well , of course , i mean , and that 's the big side .
which is also going to get that when the trust is there .
and when you 've found someone who really have a hundred percent as i need it .
and i also have the same goals .
because this is for me for trust , the next one , is really important .
you need the same goal , and i really have to be able to see what does it mean to take faith ?
because of course , often <unk> , the time you use .
i trust the or the or myself .
but that 's what that 's really important is that it 's too much .
you have to do that for trust for trust .
and you know , because we have to meet people with <unk> <unk> -- we want to see <unk> sense .
and the sense of the sense that that is very often that we 're just going to do with the <unk> objective .
for example , we 're going to do this -- in my case -- from some people , i 've been on the <unk> .
and i mean , you know , i 'm going to do that one : i have to look for anybody in the case that i just get that mountain up .
and how do you do that one in the mountain is really <unk> at the end ,
well , of course , i had the big advantage i did n't have been able to do now , for example , for example , if it 's a hundred feet next to me .
then this was relatively <unk> .
can be advantage , fear is not a problem .
and i also always been thinking again , and i 've been thinking about the fear of heights that i 'm going to be , and i 've been running out of the <unk> , and i went to the rest of <unk> , or i flew in berlin , there 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that 's already a little bit of <unk> , if you hear the car , you know , you have n't even see much , to know , i do n't know if i <unk> .
and these things are always interesting for me .
sure enough to have the <unk> of the <unk> , but hey , i 'm going to know , i mean , <unk> and can just have new experiences as well .
and that 's exactly what <unk> <unk> is a little bit about <unk> , because in <unk> mountain , you know , you 're going to go back every day , and it 's just just even more <unk> .
you go , and it 's just rocks around , and still less plants .
you look at the <unk> gun , <unk> <unk> from first world war .
so if you look at <unk> de <unk> , the <unk> of the last last , the <unk> .
this is the only exciting thing .
we have seen the selection of the distance or the others .
and so i 'm going to <unk> a lot of trust in the <unk> , despite his strange <unk> that he had .
because i thought , well , you know , i said , well , like , i said , `` well , '' i 'll be able to get away faster , like the thing to come up .
but as i said , it 's otherwise <unk> because you do n't have a lot of change in now .
and it 's really exciting to it , it becomes something that is difficult .
so if you get into the height of <unk> and the air is <unk> .
or if it 's next to a <unk> , when you have a <unk> <unk> , where it 's on the left and on the right .
and then it will be beautiful , and if it 's all the night , and everybody 's <unk> , and then the <unk> would have said , and now he would take me to the wire that he would actually really look at me and in the handle .
because i had the only one without <unk> , and then it would be risky to detail .
we 've created that , and i 've created that i just said , well , of course , of course , of course , of my mom , of my friend , that was a hundred percent of trust , i mean , and we got this before .
but i also need to have a lot of safety of safety , so i do n't have to focus on the mountain , you can imagine if you 're going to turn on the mountain all the <unk> , right on the right on the right on the right .
there 's a bird , and everybody 's time .
so for us , we 've been trust in the case , so we 're looking forward , so we put a rope on your backpack , which i had in the thought of her <unk> wire .
and in the other <unk> , i used to have a little <unk> of the stairs .
and she 's just ending up with the foot with the foot , and it 's <unk> with her <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that i just knew what i knew , and i had no way to focus on me .
and what 's really shown me just the whole thing , like beautiful it is actually , when you 're going to get close to the top of this one , you know , you know , you 're just going to be able to get this purpose into it -- just like the <unk>
but in the other hand , it 's also that i noticed that trust is that i have the answer that is that is the answer is just because i really have a really <unk> goal .
it 's also the trust is also in other people , which is just the trust thing .
so when we were the mountain <unk> , in the group , we were in the <unk> and behind us , and the other seven people went and have been a break out of us , and i 've been thinking about why , why does that look at each other , why does he look at
you can not look at night .
that 's not the reason .
and then i have noticed , ah , right , clear , clear , that , you know , that it 's pretty much more <unk> .
you go through the dark , you go to 12 watch , then we have no light .
this is <unk> , if you 're <unk> , the air is a thin , so it 's just a <unk> , and it 's not more <unk> .
and then at some point , the moment that the wait said , yes , i mean , is really totally practical , behind you because the friend of me feel all of me , we have always <unk> all the time .
have the whole night we told us , and the other people in the group that just had the luxury of <unk> , right , now it 's just <unk> hour , that 's what she told me .
or i did n't tell you what the other thing is not told by the mountain .
and that 's the same thing that 's somebody there , it may just be a bad number of thinking about it , maybe we 've been talking about -- they 're just <unk> hour that goes on .
this is exactly these things that they can also rely on the outside of the outside , and can be able to contribute to the personal gold medal .
and for me for me , i think , and then i think that 's all right , if you have the personal gold gold , and what you really want to do is actually in the idea of the idea .
this is obvious , of course , in the sports , in the gold , you know , i do n't actually know why the image do -- maybe i do n't know to test whether it 's just <unk> ?
so i think about some of the world , it 's like vancouver , which is a little bit <unk> .
if that would be all real gold , i 'm not going to go here , i would be on the <unk> that i think .
or at least in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i think the real thing that you can do , it 's more , what you can imagine , what do i have been created , and how did i have my skills and forces on a point .
what i did in my skills , but of course , of course , of course , the team that we all need no matter whether in the job of what 's going on .
anyway , when old man or young woman , we just need people to trust that we can trust .
and when we 're going to realize this goal in the head of the head , and that 's the end of that , that 's the best evidence that we could trust at least in our lives .
and if you can get it , it 's definitely in other settings .
thank you very much .
a science for me , this is the title of my talk , and that 's called <unk> of your beautiful maps .
what i 'm looking at me is the most <unk> effort , which is the sciences as a little <unk> of the general population .
basically , i could be satisfied .
so when i put in a <unk> , there 's all the <unk> of the literature on the literature of science , which is <unk> .
even each <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> , magazines , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> issues , somehow <unk> .
each street has to be at least one <unk> , which is what kind of scientific subjects .
even , that 's totally <unk> when you look at the <unk> and <unk> for children with scientific subjects .
in fact , any program already has a own coat in the <unk> , but still that 's such a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that i can like to look at that , which i can like to read , but that 's not me .
cool , cool is just a kind of science for <unk> , somewhere , somewhere , there 's the chemist , <unk> ?
at <unk> , a <unk> of five minutes , there 's nothing to do with reality , but this is cool , <unk> ?
there i can do .
big bang <unk> , because i ca n't laugh the jokes , but it 's great .
that 's terribly bad .
because this is kind of a little paradox that we can only deal with , with technology issues and issues .
but at the same time , that none of them did n't go down .
and i made some little examples of the same time , how science or science just have this place for us .
in london , in london , in london , you built a nice tower , <unk> , the architect , we do n't just build this way that 's like this .
what happens is now that the sunlight of the <unk> is that the sun drops to the surface , i 've got a <unk> <unk> , and then somewhere in the other side of a point .
this was big through the press , because unfortunately , the <unk> .
so the heat , the heat has so <unk> that this poor poor , who has really long , long save a long time , there is the <unk> path .
because i 'm going to ask , this is a architect , which does n't have learned a little bit like this in physics because i mean , is totally new that is a mirror
so , what i found is , very new , sort of <unk> in front of the <unk> b.c .
i really really ask me what has the more design or an architect or where he studied ?
this is now a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is to have such a <unk> of these issues , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , this is already a couple of years ago , and this kind of way around the media .
there was a train thought , because <unk> changed changed , that was on a threat .
genes was <unk> with green <unk> .
genes were somehow bad .
<unk> , oh , there are genes .
there were situations where the market has become really , hey , i have <unk> vegetable .
no idea what this is supposed to be , yes .
so , yes , all , the tomatoes , we can debate about it .
but at the time i was in the lab in the lab and i was really frustrated , because i 've been trying to get these bad genes in my bacteria , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home , and my neighbor neighbor : <unk> , but not happy , what is going on ?
i 'm going to do this , i try to transform this little gene in my bacteria and not work .
this was the thing i tried to explain to explain , so somehow , a <unk> , genes , i thought , well , when i talk about genes , you know what she means .
this was what i really meant , so a certain sequence that i wanted to get in these <unk> .
but that 's what the woman has experienced the woman .
this woman has never <unk> me back .
who knows what i <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is a bad thing .
this is good 10 years ago , and still that 's sort of a lot of the minds .
genes that is anything bad .
i have n't read a long time .
and it 's always <unk> technology , and it really did n't have made it in our language .
<unk> can be in europe , was a headline .
<unk> is different from other corn , which contains no genes .
another news , <unk> will die .
yes , that was a beautiful headline .
but they are not that old , and it 's also good , which is what level i am .
do n't matter whether time or the picture , all about <unk> .
happiness is not <unk> in the <unk> , but i 'm afraid that 's not a long time .
but that just shows what uncertainty is in the population , because they 're just not interested in the issues .
in fact , we have to engage in our future with these technologies .
now , now , it was just <unk> , none of the issues , but it 's going to be about things that most people have no idea .
and this is pretty sad .
how is this information from the lab in the population ?
so if we assume that little , young , motivated scientists in his lab , has a experiment , a experiment , beautiful and good , and he 's right , the person , that 's what the public is
then the first thing has to go on the professor .
the head , the decides that decides to decide , okay , cool topic , <unk> his name on the science of science , <unk> .
good idea , i 'm not even in public , it 's about a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> , wow , great idea , class , we make a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> project , a nice idea , and that 's kind of coming out of the <unk> .
that 's going to be <unk> , but who actually are ?
now these <unk> are rare alone , usually a common <unk> , a common <unk> .
and from all these things that will be the <unk> , the <unk> projects of the magazine that the <unk> , whether it 's <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
that 's the path .
and the basis of the basis , it 's always <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> , really cool experiments , really <unk> projects , into these <unk> .
these are good <unk> magazine , that 's really good , there 's one of all of all are free , yes , but who are i going to do ?
basically , just the ones that are interested in .
in the <unk> , we always call the <unk> of the <unk> .
so the ones that 's interested in for this , the <unk> , yeah , beautiful and good .
beautiful magazine , reached the poor people who are interested in for this , and the perhaps have about a single idea where the world 's going on in this articles .
who are i <unk> ?
the <unk> that 's going to be interested in .
the <unk> , that 's what it was in the otto <unk> , and i would call him the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who read other journals , i tried to keep it . i do n't really get to
but nevertheless , again , our future will be able to address if we have these <unk> .
fracking , <unk> , renewable energy , <unk> , <unk> , that are all kinds of issues that the <unk> <unk> , but does n't really understand and about the ones he 's going to do .
so my project is , of course , different <unk> , very young , very young , very young , very young , <unk> scientists from the <unk> , really completely totally completely disconnected from his normal <unk> , and there 's a class of how to communicate
what 's mostly happened , so i have a <unk> , we have experienced a buddy , for good years , he 's <unk> , it 's a <unk> rule , it does n't ask him to ask him questions .
once he <unk> the mouth and told his job , he told us .
<unk> , these are scientists that tell you what a <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is almost like the same level of genes .
it 's treated , that 's kind of , oh , you do n't know what 's going on .
i really want to teach , i think that it 's nice , that 's nice and good , if you go on a conference , and you know , your <unk> , you want to tell you , you know , you can tell you about <unk> , but <unk> even <unk>
where is the problem , really <unk> and <unk> ?
so i school , this is my idea , this young scientist who are not so far from the hierarchy of hierarchy , who are a little bit of malleable , the school i said ,
this has to use for all one , <unk> , <unk> , investors who want to know what happens in the <unk> .
and finally , the price of money , that 's the one that 's going to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to communicate the <unk> .
but this training , that 's just a story .
i 'd like to put them in front of a jury , and i want to imagine your project , a <unk> of a jury , <unk> , <unk> , worse , worse .
there 's not a quote , i do n't know if that 's real , albert einstein : if you ca n't explain it , you do n't really understand it .
so , the scientists from the lab and start to rethink your project , how can i think the really normal intelligible ?
this is a lot of stories .
now , <unk> are totally modern , everywhere , in every university , common , but i just get the <unk> <unk> .
so who 's going to the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the city of the university in the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university in the university of the university , making a talk of <unk> in the university of the university ?
these are the way that 's going to be interested in .
there i have my <unk> .
so , these are the people who are interested in for this , and you 're listening to the talks there .
that 's nice , there are any <unk> <unk> , everybody 's being happy , everybody 's happy , driving home , and this is it .
so i 'm going to put on a second point , to say it 's not at that <unk> project .
so these scientists are actually trained , like <unk> kids ?
because there 's a lot of really <unk> to the essence .
because scientists , like the research , and how kids explore their world is identical .
children work very <unk> .
they make anything like this .
you try to do what this works ?
<unk> , fall , no way , no way , it does n't work , next repetition , i change a few parameters , do it again .
children learn <unk> .
this is really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> what happens i need to change or not .
this is normal .
but this is a lot of <unk> .
and so , of course , i think , really , really , really , that 's really if you get the <unk> and <unk> these scientists in the neighborhood where the kids make toast with the kids , and i really believe that children and the scientists actually talk about the same language .
and then you can have the hope , maybe that 's my hope to tell the children , and then i get to me , and then i get to me , and then i get to me , and then i get to me , and then i get to me , and then i get to me , and then i get to me , and then i get to the scientific <unk> , which is also for scientific issues , because the children 's telling him the tell him .
this is not in the newspaper , that 's not somewhere in galileo , but his children 's going to tell him a little mirror that it has been <unk> , and it may also get a piece of paper , and then the architect can do a house .
and not only i 'm going to get to the gentleman , of course , <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it just <unk> that the first <unk> that i had , said , well , <unk> for our scientists , which is not just the subject that 's just a little bit of priorities .
the scientists do n't have to communicate .
yeah , i think , okay , i 'm going to do this .
but who 's sort of work in the institute , <unk> is in a company , as well , there are the next break .
thank you very much .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
fly .
the last couple of weeks were terrible .
the weather has made us a big line on the calculation .
seven , seven years ago i was asked if i want to take this one .
i was in the ceo of ceo , almost 10 years old <unk> in <unk> and in <unk> .
we came up to the top .
had <unk> <unk> .
and for me , that 's really , well , that 's what this is <unk> .
what is that ?
<unk> , that 's actually ridiculous .
but i 've seen learned who is behind that behind , and i stand here today .
and maybe it 's a little crazy , but it 's too emotional .
it 's nice and always exciting and power of big fun .
and i 'm going to just ask you in the next <unk> , <unk> minutes , a little bit of that life of one .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
the company has been there for a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company has been for two years .
and the ceo of the <unk> .
the company has been on about <unk> or <unk> years .
that 's the zeppelin on the <unk> .
<unk> .
this is a picture i want to show you here , which is right , which is right , which is really a red , which is a red <unk> , or anything that does n't know exactly that point is big .
and this is just the world 's going on the world .
and that 's actually just 10 active .
that 's what we see .
there are about 20 thousand active active active <unk> .
so this is actually not the market .
that 's not a uniquely altered area .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is , why do you do that ?
so how does this go ?
<unk> , and only 10 active , because we can talk about this .
just short to history .
<unk> has a <unk> crazy <unk> <unk> .
very short <unk> .
has graduated from <unk> girls from the first world war .
then in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died , <unk> and <unk> , were built around <unk> .
you were bombed in london and so forth .
and when we got <unk> and eight after london , and with a big <unk> campaign , the english newspapers were <unk> with the headline , and it 's time , but not with bombs .
so the story is in <unk> .
and we had a wrong campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was n't that <unk> , because suddenly , suddenly , has become clear what 's going to put behind that old memories in there .
and you know , it was a little critical care of marketing .
but yet , it was a good campaign , except the weather in the north was very bad and very <unk> .
and we flew very much .
then <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> has taken over .
and one of us did a <unk> of america that became the united states .
this has been on a myth that 's kind of felt that the whole german nation is just felt something as <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
it was <unk> in new york city .
and the big german nation is <unk> , we 're back who are again .
that 's in all the <unk> , and this is really the explain to that myth of this device .
but in fact , then they 're <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven <unk> ever built , and actually only two right , the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , the passengers have <unk> .
<unk> , a hundred , where <unk> passengers were looking at <unk> <unk> .
but it was a myth .
and then the <unk> at the time , the first live <unk> crash was actually <unk> .
for the titanic of the event , when a icon , a product is <unk> , and then never would never get the <unk> .
the other devices were <unk> .
and <unk> , <unk> <unk> the last existing <unk> .
the material is used for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
then there was nothing about <unk> years .
and then the <unk> had <unk> <unk> and the zeppelin that had the idea , maybe you should start .
and i became hired to <unk> , because you 've created a great product , we get the same thing , but the market .
is he at all the market ?
what 's going on here ?
so .
now we 're going to talk about this .
the <unk> of the zeppelin that 's still going to explain a little bit , we <unk> around time , <unk> , people have a lot of <unk> .
there are many companies that came from this <unk> .
there are <unk> employees , about 20 billion revenue .
this is a real economy , <unk> .
there 's a lot of behind that .
and i really convinced me to come here .
the zeppelin is actually a normal airplane like every other airplane , but has me , sorry , has <unk> a gas , helium is not hydrogen , and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
is like a whale that 's on the water and underneath it , and there must be the <unk> .
the time is not there to explain the details .
inside , a zeppelin looks like this with a structure .
there are two types of <unk> .
there 's <unk> <unk> , which is we , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
there are no structure , and they are like <unk> in <unk> .
these are most <unk> , which are built in the world , <unk> , <unk> piece .
and of course , there 's only what i said before i said earlier , only one was going on , that 's only about 20 years ago .
that 's what the production is being raised by a device .
on the left , again .
and the shell is also <unk> .
come from the <unk> .
source : the <unk> of the astronauts .
in fact , the origins are the origins .
one point is to cost two million dollars a device .
and it has to be <unk> , and it has to be <unk> and have to be <unk> , because every time you have to look at the same time , or a hole that it 's not <unk> .
there 's what the <unk> can do again and look at whether it will control in holes .
and at the end of the end , the <unk> is a <unk> , without the health .
so the zeppelin is technically a <unk> product .
and this is what you look at the bottom up there , very quickly .
one point nine percent , one point nine , one point nine percent <unk> six <unk> , which is called a thousand thousand flights , maybe <unk> <unk> .
that 's very very little and very good .
this is a <unk> .
you can see that .
but there 's another trend that makes us <unk> us here .
we had three years ago , when i started <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year , or <unk> percent .
and this year , we were at <unk> percent .
so if you get eight years , my eight years , with the <unk> and <unk> of that , you can say , `` at least in this eight years , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , in this eight years , that 's what the weather changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can also fly <unk> by fog .
you want to see something .
and the <unk> or <unk> will rise in every year .
so a little picture of this , that our weather is not just felt like , but we do weather every day .
but this is the good , the e.u . that 's the e.u .
i 'm going to come from finland today .
the <unk> is there is a flying lab .
<unk> is the campaign .
and we make <unk> <unk> between the earth 's feet .
it 's called <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin is <unk> by italy to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
there 's a lot of a hundred and a lot of a hundred and a lot of a hundred <unk> , and analyzed the water as it reacts to our things that we react to the ground .
there i 'm going to explain , so i just <unk> up with the second <unk> .
a great assignment .
and is if you want to make this kind of <unk> out of weather .
so this is very good .
and here 's another <unk> .
the <unk> about sweden is last week or <unk> week .
and in finland , the weather is great , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> you never had .
i just got wonderful , beautiful warm days .
they were not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have been looking for de <unk> when <unk> diamond was looking for volcanoes that are the <unk> killed by <unk> years .
just , you can ask , it 's all of the things that is all of africa when you ask for sense , after a question , it 's kind of questions that 's going to ask meaning in the cinema at the movie , at the end of the movie is <unk> <unk> .
so , i wondered , what do we do here ?
and what are we going to support that ?
at the end , we were done for two years .
the <unk> went on .
the whole <unk> came back and the project was finished .
and a tornado hit the zeppelin on the mast , that he could stay in the bottom .
but was n't so bad .
we had good insurance , and they were really happy .
and this was the prototype .
and i did n't know what i should do .
yes , what we do today is a quick <unk> of the <unk> from the <unk> .
what we do today , it 's just about complexity , it 's about questions , growth .
what we 're doing today is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we 're <unk> .
we have to get the zeppelin .
<unk> is <unk> .
there are always devices inside 10 , fifteen , again , we have to be replaced .
we just replace the whole world 's worth of five million dollars .
there 's what we want to do with the customer .
we have to do the world 's time .
we 're an <unk> <unk> , which is controlled by the germans of the germans and from the european <unk> , and all the time , with <unk> like <unk> , or <unk> .
that 's also <unk> and costs money , and it 's going to keep getting still .
the question is , you actually do it ?
do you want to develop ?
do you make bigger <unk> ?
there are <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
what do you do ?
you go to the market ?
you go to the business ?
and that 's what we did in my time .
and there 's also a few <unk> <unk> .
as the way , the <unk> of the <unk> has been <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
initially , on the <unk> , the donation of <unk> stood up .
the population the german population has saved him with six million <unk> than <unk> , and he basically said , the population has made him a donation .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the other companies , and we do n't know , or <unk> , i 'm not going to do today , and other companies
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and they were listening to the past in san francisco with a customers .
there was a very <unk> <unk> .
both projects are failed .
so <unk> .
at the same time , we won <unk> .
there i do n't have a picture , because we ca n't show the <unk> problem .
but in america , now the <unk> of the first <unk> in america will be done .
we sold three pieces .
with <unk> , we 're developing with a partner in a partner a technique .
and this is a big success , but at the same time , you know .
two customers have been basically <unk> because it did n't go .
why did n't it ?
we actually know .
either was not the right place or the passengers had to have had to have to know , or in america , you know , you know , the last 30 percent forty percent forty year .
so the <unk> people have been <unk> , <unk> , have said , `` <unk> , again , again , again , a <unk> , of power advertising .
there does n't know that you can do that .
and it was actually being twice the equivalent of marketing : hey , people <unk> and flies .
<unk> goes fine .
the pilot on the year , there 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year , we just have <unk> managed to weather .
there 's a half a million .
this is bad .
the zeppelin flies <unk> <unk> here .
it 's the sense of course , of course , of course , if i look at the <unk> , and we do n't look at the passengers , and we 're not going to go into a <unk> , because it 's going to be <unk> , and again , it 's nice to <unk> , and people think that 's nice , and that 's so beautiful , and who 's going to continue to be <unk> ,
and we 've been <unk> .
and i have to clean clean with the mistake that you 're looking at .
you could still make more flying .
we have the curve of the <unk> and we 're <unk> .
and that 's not true .
we do advertising .
this is a project called <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> has done this in the island of <unk> .
but the <unk> is a difficult market .
and you know , you have to ask the <unk> question : power is always sense ?
we actually have enough advertising , but the internet has changed much , the <unk> of the beginning , because the <unk> control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , therefore there 's just about 10 <unk> <unk> in the world .
we have three .
two active , one came , <unk> , three has a <unk> , 10 are active .
so , six of 10 .
that 's what we 're going to do is actually , actually , the market is actually when it 's at all one .
and hope to come back to that again .
and what finally , david scott , commander of the apollo fifteen , after his <unk> paris , after his <unk> paris , and five , he said , `` the street walk on the <unk> of what <unk> .
so <unk> is beautiful .
and we 're going to make a <unk> .
we do n't find any customers .
and we find a great deal of mind , has a technological value .
there we have customers .
that 's not going steadily .
it 's <unk> , <unk> .
so this is a kind of a <unk> that takes years to get it .
and then there is no years back .
there 's also a funny effect that are easy to control and hard to control .
in every case , this is the situation , <unk> , a point in the world market is not a market .
yet , we continue to continue .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to make it .
so they just just put the question : what 's going to do it ?
how much money give us to the world market ?
what do we do for here ?
what the form is to do that ?
and i personally , they asked me to say , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of my ted <unk> , where i wanted to get <unk> <unk> , at the time , the little <unk> , it 's going to be dead .
i was once in greenpeace three years , as i 've been <unk> by vancouver island , and i 've seen this whole <unk> <unk> , and i 've been able to make this <unk> .
and in the time , there were an <unk> about greenpeace that are <unk> in the money , and not know what they 're supposed to do and <unk> .
there were me to <unk> this .
and i have estimated that three years , as a <unk> , and i 'm going to do that in hope , a long future of the zeppelin .
zero , is n't that ? <unk> seconds , i 'm done , thank you .
<unk> .
thank you very much .
these are my three points i want to talk to in the <unk> minutes .
why are we the excess of the abundance or <unk> ?
how do we get to a <unk> ?
and importantly , what do we do ?
what is it going on ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is a little <unk> .
but it 's also to show the challenges .
a few years ago about this is more difficult to explain .
that 's a problem today , every child .
we have environmental issues .
but again , there 's always a time that 's worth sharing the challenges of economic growth for example .
all kinds of <unk> are growing exponentially .
if you see it in a historic long view , the oil oil , for example , this is a very quick episode in history .
at the moment , we ca n't imagine that somehow , the way oil is going to go off again .
you know the climate change that last <unk> years .
some people say , well , in fact , there were the last <unk> years .
and you can also look at <unk> , i 'm also right now .
you can also say , who 's going to do that ?
you can say that the ocean is far away .
but it 's already going to deal with a little bit more specifically to do really interesting , to avoid things that are really easy to avoid , and we have trouble with the <unk> of the health .
<unk> is that it 's worth over 30 degrees of time .
and there 's a level of time in our cities like in vienna , or in the way , or <unk> , you know , still , in the way , or <unk> , they are always <unk> too .
but it 's also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas where the big streams and the <unk> are affected by the himalayas to the himalayas .
it 's not about the end of the planet .
the planet is the <unk> of what we do , there were much larger crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us about the people that are very hostile to change .
it 's about biodiversity on biodiversity .
the deserts spread out .
the freshwater becomes less .
this is the aral sea , which is an essential part of our cotton .
and all that is that ?
all of these bad things , i think , `` hang on one or another form of global <unk> .
and what we get in the earth from earth we harvest .
not just the oil and the metals and the minerals , but also the renewables are renewable , but after the end of the end .
and we 're just going to look at the way that we use that way to produce less <unk> and emissions .
so this is about the most pessimistic number one , really dramatically dramatically .
this is the challenge , not only c , not only c , two , <unk> of a car , but really live different .
different from the economies .
we 're going to change our technology .
now , if we go back to the west , and they still <unk> , and there are still the world , and it 's still in the earth , which are going to live in the principle of a <unk> system per person and year .
in a <unk> , there was three to the human history of five tons .
today , it 's fifteen to <unk> .
so that 's <unk> .
and he 's very , very glamorous distributed on earth .
it 's more than anywhere in north america is unsustainable for us .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa very much less .
and we get the impact on us , the impact , the air , the air , the air has gotten much better in the last decades , but it 's essentially basically that we 've gone into other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world is much less like less .
and therefore the conflict , the conflicts that we see from <unk> , is that 's , afghanistan , where you look at the most of the american <unk> survey and then you see where the resources are from .
and this is particularly colorful , which is , there 's lots of resources there , where the <unk> of the world is .
so if we want to make a clean room , we have to come up with the issue .
so we have to change the ecological boundaries everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and this is what we have in <unk> life is not <unk> .
this is the shot of mahatma gandhi when he said the world has enough for everybody 's needs , but not for everybody 's greed .
and here we are , like we have a lot of life on average .
so .
that was the kind of <unk> part .
but i always think that you need to do the way to understand this way .
even if i would say to later , it 's also worth living in life , which is more <unk> .
but it 's always sort of , again , from the <unk> <unk> , you know , i have a rationale for a minute .
so what is a <unk> ?
and we have to look at that , in our rich , we have to deal with the world that 's so much , socially , essential to quality of living , living in the average of living in the average of living in the average .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you 're also sure people who do n't do so good with this story .
i wrote there .
<unk> and climate change have the same cause .
we 're working too much and too heavy .
that 's on a side that we 're going to get themselves in stress , and there 's too much more .
i love to work too .
and on the other side , we just get this <unk> .
but what is a good life ?
how can we define this ?
now this is a little bit of scientific scientific <unk> .
so also , what i 've been told , and what i 'm going to say is to be <unk> , but here 's it just about how can i define that kind of first ?
and there is important to understand life is always two things .
quality of life does the objective conditions that i 'm going to eat .
did i have a roof about the head ?
i have friends ?
i realized i could participate in life ?
but just like me , how do i go out for me ?
i mean , i think that 's the perceived quality of life .
and then i put two words that are important to the point .
one is needs .
the needs is the need to have a fundamental dimension of our human flourishing , our way , that 's about emotions .
if we can satisfy our needs , we 're happy .
and needs to say , needs to be sustainable or unsustainable .
needs to se se .
what are needs ?
can you quote different scientists , i just called two .
and of course , of course , the physical needs , but also need to have a need for social relations .
after <unk> , according to <unk> , after creativity , after freedom , after freedom .
that 's all a little thing to do with money .
but in fact , not in a big part , but the question is , how can i put this in my life .
and i 'm in the second important term .
strategies .
the strategy that i 'm going to do is to meet me that needs .
and there is where i 'm going to go to you , this is what i can like to do with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> .
there i can need a lot of money or more money .
so strategies is just my behavior as i <unk> my needs .
that has to do with my values with the resources that i have .
if i have a little money i 'm going to try to satisfy my needs , to satisfy when i have a lot of money on the account .
it 's first about the <unk> , that 's the roof of your head , and then the <unk> of the <unk> .
and this is where it goes up with a lot or <unk> , which can be sustainable or <unk> .
and if we are all the strategies that are available to satisfy my needs , then we talk about a lifestyle change .
so .
this was the kind of scientific <unk> .
and now you go to now , what can we do ?
how does it go ?
and this is just a couple of evidence .
of course , that 's what everybody has to find themselves for itself .
but the evidence of the individual kind of representation in a technical way , which is , think about technology , and finally in the end of a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
the slides of the slides , like the threat , the danger is that we use more resources to more than more resources .
for the end of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality , the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality , the effects are always worse , sort of , like , and on the end of us , they will beat back .
or , whether we 're going to make it , there 's a different direction that can go with less <unk> , but with less consumption , with a higher quality of life .
there 's one of my <unk> , perhaps a few , <unk> , <unk> of the topic of <unk> <unk> , so more of the quality of life .
there 's a lot about technology as i can do every single thing that we can use the computer , the coffee , the coffee , the coffee , the traffic , the traffic , how can i make this ?
so , cement can produce different , i can build the house , etc. ,
and to create more less <unk> or making the same quality of life .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has so stable , the <unk> of the <unk> , and there 's what we 've been talking about today , and it 's going to be deep
where are the needs of ?
what services i can do ?
and how can i do that little <unk> ?
it 's not a little bit of less than <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's lots of examples that already exists .
in vienna , a tower is built with twenty <unk> .
with seven <unk> , it 's already built .
that 's essentially <unk> .
you know , if you ca n't need to go back to 50 years , and then you do n't have a little bit of bits and it 's not a lot less resource in the moment , and the goal is in the end of the <unk> , about the whole era of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house .
but it 's also a lot in our own , sort of , like <unk> , i actually have ?
<unk> <unk> wrote a nice book , <unk> .
where he shows how hard it is in the end of the end , really the way out of the way out of this treadmill .
the <unk> , i want to come up , and i 'm in this race in this race .
you kind of <unk> , which i made , and then i get the new .
the most beautiful <unk> , i mean , you all know , you know .
when i started my institute , a few years ago , we wrote letters .
and then you 're going to wait a letter to the letter now i write , is a <unk> <unk> .
for that , i write hundreds of email .
and i can do a lot more .
that 's productivity , that 's economic growth , we get back to this .
but i did n't really have a really time .
i did n't know that .
but there are good examples , slow food , for example , where i really do the risk of quality and the claim of the quality of the quality into the foreground .
and with a very small <unk> of life .
one of my favorite examples is <unk> .
there 's the world today you 've been looking at the average average person in germany , austria about 10,000 things in household .
you can start to count .
who two , three generations of thousands of times , had employees , personal .
they have the managed .
we have to do ourselves .
and fewer people come up with these options .
and need a guide that helps us <unk> us with these few things .
for instance , i think about what i think about is a more recent application of spaceship , think that i ca n't have 10 things .
the next example is one of these things instead .
a true boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> may have been used to two years ago in the alternatives .
in the meantime , it always use more people when you think about <unk> .
if you think about <unk> .
the platform , business models that are just working on the way that you can have already have the things that we have already built this beautiful <unk> , that 's already been able to use a few hundred years ago , and that 's still about the end of the end .
and that 's what even used to do better .
that 's also last question of justice .
i showed you just like <unk> that is the picture between africa and europe and a <unk> world .
so , the same thing that all of the same time you can do with this resource is just if we use less .
and that does n't mean less quality of life , because many of us have already been looking at much .
but it 's a important task of the economy that businesses , these products , these services , to make the services we need to create a good life with much less resources .
last question that has also been to do with the big policy , <unk> to the growth , i think .
if you look at a little bit attention to the <unk> , it 's <unk> of oecd , <unk> , every week , this is going to <unk> this <unk> .
it 's , yes , a crisis in front of my view of my view , and also after the fact that we 've been talking to a lot of the economists , and that are the numbers for austria , they 're just going to be in the <unk> growth .
and there is no reason to have growth , as i know that from the youth , from the <unk> .
part of the time this is pure reasons .
one point five percent is so much as eight percent growth today .
and eight percent is what china has today .
that 's what we might have been on the rest of a 50 years ago .
by the total , when the cake is bigger , of course , eight percent discount .
and this one percent is still much , so that 's going to do well .
but you do n't have to put on it , which is , that does n't mean , does n't mean , does n't mean , does n't have zero percent growth , it would like that , in the next year , they are producing so much and eat it in this year .
we can invest well , and we can work together .
and that 's not so <unk> , because you know that the statistics is not going to be on the growth of the quality of life .
the economy is growing , but the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of living in developed countries that we are .
and by the way , jobs are also possible without growth , and that 's not that close to the way that it 's connected by <unk> and how they all become the hot manifestation .
that 's not true , and then you have to engage with economics .
and it 's always more and more and more often , <unk> like <unk> or next week , the mind that i think , in the trend , a bigger story , <unk> through this topic .
already , <unk> <unk> has <unk> <unk> , the nobel prize <unk> in his <unk> is that he told the good life , the good economy of the good life
that 's the end of the end , and not about the <unk> , not primarily about growth , which is not going to be more .
for <unk> and the country , for china , for india , there 's a huge story .
and it 's just like that , under the same time , when we grow up there , and we just just like that level , on this very high level that we are good and economies .
this is also the policy .
it takes goals .
it needs <unk> , say the economists .
it does n't need the growth , but we really should look at the look , and what is it in the quality of life , it goes on ?
is the down ?
and they also measure our politicians .
of course , how much is the <unk> ?
how does that go together ?
we need a fundamental aspect to the <unk> and finally , and not the work .
who are especially the entrepreneurs under you , but the workers , you know , very well .
what kind of <unk> , we even have paid for a colleagues .
you could make it different .
the resources are <unk> , and therefore the resources are <unk> , and not the work .
and you have to do all the <unk> to create employment , to ensure financial services , health , infrastructure without growth .
this is what 's going to do , but there 's a little bit better .
so , the conclusion , is more or less , on all levels , can be working on , we can work hard , we can work better , we can ask for the real products , services as a consumer , as a consumer , what we need to do , how do we do what we do .
what do we need and what we need to do ?
the right policy , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
a couple of evidence i gave .
and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , the science of the most important science is still going to boost growth ?
now , did n't have any done .
if you look at the <unk> , when you look at the last 20 years , it 's always because it 's not .
the policy is not making and the economists will not create growth , but that 's the question that we do with , and that 's what we have a good life of that ?
so , <unk> 's it .
it 's the <unk> of you to lake .
with heart , brain , hand , hand , we also need the <unk> .
thank you very much .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
and this town has to tell a lot of stories .
one of them has happened a few years ago .
and has to do with creative issues .
and i 'm going to come on this creative problem , and i 'll come in the story later .
they will have to do with the citadel .
this is <unk> , which is in the middle of this city , and a lot of this town is also changing and changes .
another story before .
it was in a hot summer day in <unk> , nevada mountains .
a man notice that in its shoes like this is right .
it 's warm to warm .
he 's europeans , he does n't know that with the heat .
he 's making a <unk> of the shoe <unk> <unk> in a long time , and that 's a lot of holes there .
he <unk> the shoe , and he 's going to see a new climate .
it 's the shoe who breathes .
and this number that you see here is the place in the <unk> of the <unk> here tonight .
a company is <unk> , with four letters .
one or another of you know .
he has actually offered the original idea , and they offered .
both of them .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
he goes on the stock market .
<unk> today is several thousand employees in a small <unk> in the world in the world .
this is a lot of creative problem .
why not a new invent what 's not there ?
and this may be asked the question for <unk> <unk> .
if you do n't know , you know , what is that a chance ?
so this question has been helped me in difficult situations .
if something went wrong or my <unk> or technology does n't work or whatever .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what 's the opportunity ?
and it 's already a <unk> in the <unk> .
so what that can do is the difference between this example .
and another example of the <unk> was collected by the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> findings of <unk> .
and the evidence is how creative people can be if it comes to your own insurance .
i want to show you a few examples here .
so , in fact , that 's like the <unk> of the <unk> , and it has made a <unk> .
i 'm a fantastic thing .
my son has not <unk> the woman .
he 's just <unk> , which is the woman through the <unk> .
or i had the whole day , when i reached the <unk> , i grew up a bush in my view , and i could n't see the other car .
all right , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 've been <unk> , and two times almost .
you know , you know , you know , you know , at least half the most <unk> on it .
the last thing i was not fault .
it was the young woman in the <unk> .
if you are a man , each other explanation <unk> .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i wish i would work that we all use more of these creativity .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that 's not that .
why not do things go different ?
the old things that we 're going to do that are becoming the routine that may have been bored or <unk> .
why not just make anything different , the <unk> , as little simple <unk> .
and there 's these <unk> companies that use that .
for example , <unk> , that have the <unk> of their <unk> , and the signs of the <unk> , for example , and there is what it might be on .
one possibility , right ?
let 's go to the coffee instead of the coffee .
or anything .
we have no <unk> , <unk> .
now is today , right ?
if you ca n't put your cell phone .
or eat them every time we both .
<unk> , but creative .
this is what it takes .
i think about the one of the customers , and i 'd like to tell you the <unk> and say , okay , okay .
that 's the <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and that 's in <unk> .
once the sport 's the most important news , once politics .
when you were three times in the <unk> , you 're <unk> .
once the complaint was the complaint about the long <unk> of food .
it 's a <unk> building and restaurant that are very small , so the chefs had to do all the hands of all the hands .
it was too deeply .
you have thought , together , what do we do ?
how do we solve this problem ?
we ca n't get faster in the kitchen .
this idea is made .
on every table , a <unk> <unk> <unk> salt , pepper and a <unk> .
so , in fact , the people in the wait for you to eat your <unk> themselves .
just a little bit different .
a creative idea , and maybe the problem with <unk> .
there 's a person who does not just <unk> .
this person is the leader of <unk> , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and in fact , the german <unk> hit the german .
already the second day , that takes a monday day , so four days .
a company <unk> <unk> for the staff of the month , and you may have people already , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
people come to the book <unk> .
the bus is full of the buses , and it 's going to get <unk> , people are <unk> in a carpool , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , from a way of looking for a <unk> .
but why not be able to be able to be able to do something that 's going to do something about his disadvantage ?
sometimes the creativity also happens .
and it comes from a <unk> , maybe that 's what they might know .
so we know that it 's not really good , not really good , but it has to be saving to the <unk> , but something is a matter .
or <unk> in the car .
there 's the different , <unk> , and all kinds of directions .
yes .
why does n't be a <unk> <unk> when you 're <unk> ?
or <unk> , we have opportunities to make the creative .
and all of all that has just do with humor with me , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
again , my <unk> son was in my office .
and it 's on me on that <unk> .
so , we have several <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he turns out of the left on the left , he says he 's joy , and i do you know , stop listening , that 's not a playground here .
to me , look at me , big eyes , playground .
and in the moment , i actually actually did it right now , right ?
why is this not a big one ?
why is what we do , the playground for adults ?
but this is a much more sense , right ?
if we 're relaxed if we use our talents , what we like to do .
and they 're going to get <unk> , but <unk> .
so the strange part is that when a little day of the time this week is changing what happens in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week and somehow , our focus on a different day .
that 's what a different day we have to do .
so in the weekend .
that 's what you hear about the media .
at the <unk> institute , it 's just one day to the weekend .
or then when the most beautiful time of the year 's announced , the vacation .
what are the rest of the <unk> weeks of the year ?
is it so terrible ?
have we all have so awful jobs ?
a <unk> was given to the cover , this topic .
yes , in the monday , i have the rest of your life for me .
or on <unk> , on facebook , everywhere in social networks will be picked up this issue .
i once <unk> the <unk> , one of the most <unk> in <unk> .
and there 's a lot of business , and i 'd like to look at me .
what did the deal with the <unk> , what is there ?
and one day i <unk> that business with this sign .
and the first sign that you see here , yes , pretty nice .
so , with these love of love instead of work .
i <unk> that , father of five kids , but i also love my work .
yes .
or <unk> for <unk> is the <unk> sign .
why the own attitude , which is represented by itself , and that 's always going to continue .
somebody 's there as a answer to this direction , it 's not the monday , it 's your jobs .
and i actually actually ask with the pink glasses , come up here , and say , okay , just the way .
what about my job is beautiful ?
so stupid is , even if it 's the pink glasses , it 's all the same way .
so a nice thing to talk about is not nice , does n't work .
the pink glasses is <unk> to the bicycle .
and there 's a wonderful flying off to fly that otherwise in the eye .
but not <unk> .
where is that if we do n't change this ?
in fact , the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside as <unk> .
it may end up in a system where we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes up in this wheel and running and running , and eventually it gets to quickly , that wheel is getting the poor mouse and it 's going out .
what does the mouse make ?
they do n't know anything else , they 're in the <unk> .
and again , again , and again , maybe the movie is that the movie is that the <unk> will be aware of that , you know , it 's going to be soft .
that 's nice with hay here with hay , so you 're not going to do it , and it 's always going to go and again .
and that , what we feel as a funny thought of the mouse once , yes ?
or anything is that it needs <unk> <unk> .
i was so far as i was in a lot of my days ago .
and suddenly , in fact , the street was like i felt was black before my eyes , and somehow i have to stay .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what 's going on ?
and he was looking at me , and he told me , it 's kind of all .
but what does it look like ?
and i looked at my calendar to test that , and i saw i worked three weeks , and somehow <unk> me .
after six years in the <unk> and participants , the first thing that we can ask at early at early in the first night ,
did i think about what else is going to jobs ?
and we started to make <unk> , back to other priorities , to look at the time i 'm going to do with my family , something good for me .
now , in fact , it 's not an <unk> form of my job , a new piece .
i realized the talks about a big groups that are really joy .
i 'm looking for the advice of counseling and <unk> and other things , but these talks are allowed to give me a little bit separate , share experiences that are really joy .
and that was n't that way .
and i have to realize that that these <unk> makes homeless stress .
and sometimes it takes really this shot on the front of the boat , <unk> from me from the hospital , after he had a heart attack , and suddenly , he starts to start <unk> .
when i said , when i said , you 're going to leave you , he 's always <unk> me , you know , you 're going to walk and so .
today he 's today .
so with <unk> , beautiful , on the right <unk> , but eventually we will go together in common .
what happens ?
the bottom line is we all become healthier .
the <unk> will go down , but one curve , which is <unk> , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> four percent in the last 10 years , <unk> <unk> percent , that 's beautiful , that 's less .
increasing the mental illness plus <unk> percent .
that 's something that i think about this ?
why is that ?
is this just in austria ?
no , even in germany .
<unk> , <unk> , that 's all going to be healthier .
this is so on the left .
bottom psychiatric disease are very much plus seven percent in the last 10 years , a big german <unk> .
the number of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the cost .
and really all kinds of <unk> , what can we do with this topic ?
so , let me get these things like this , for example , like this .
so , it 's good .
and somebody said no alcohol is not a solution .
but what 's the solution ?
what 's what we do again , and it 's getting more fragile and <unk> it ?
and this is me busy .
i have thought , there 's something like <unk> , can i do something like this ?
i 'm <unk> , the job is not what i 'm going to be <unk> and make happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , and so on .
but the fact is that we spend the biggest part of our <unk> in work .
and if we do that , why do n't they do that it has joy and others like that .
so the <unk> of the <unk> , i 'm going to give you the last one of them to <unk> and <unk> .
these little <unk> you hopefully notice .
<unk> is for talent , freedom and environment .
that means how <unk> i am my talents ?
what do i do in the environment , i do that with who ?
what the freedom is i got here to do what i want to do ?
because is the level of <unk> , which is <unk> .
the more of them , the more stress .
and what do i do ?
the realization .
that 's the four areas of that .
and everybody can actually test for themselves .
i had to check this for me a few years ago , and i always put it constantly again .
can i use my talents ?
what the environment ?
and that means , i mean , i go to a cafe with my laptop to prepare for the president or a <unk> .
the freedom .
which freedom i can do is to do what is important .
and i do it ?
the realization .
last u .
and then there 's always people that tell me why not go .
and why this is much more difficult to you .
and i 'd like to have a answer to this point .
who wants to find ways .
who is not a reasons .
and by the point of the place , you can choose to choose a way of thinking , i think , `` i have some reasons ?
and they 're going to have in both right .
so what do we do with our mouths ?
every one of you has its big <unk> <unk> .
that 's too small too small .
and that 's filled with talents with gold , with everything , with your skills .
what do we do ?
by the end of the day , we wonder .
or if we 're in the hospital or at the end of a life .
what did i do with <unk> ?
by the way , who 's walking on <unk> <unk> , can like to access here .
so , what we do with our commitment , is my first question for me to itself , and that is every day .
am i all enough enough ?
and resources .
and there was something with a story .
i wanted to tell you about <unk> .
and the <unk> i do .
this fortress was the bailout of the saving for <unk> years ago as a result of the <unk> .
and the enemies of realized that this fortress was so good , that you could n't take them .
<unk> walls , <unk> , the <unk> of the fortress , <unk> doors , <unk> <unk> .
was <unk> at the time .
so this thought , okay , okay , if we do n't get in , we make a <unk> .
we do n't make any more <unk> and pure .
let 's look at the same time there .
the <unk> thought it was it from long to the day where the <unk> were used .
they only have a <unk> of the way to become <unk> like the <unk> on the bishop , the bishop gave me this <unk> and give me three days .
so this is okay , `` <unk> , you have the web , i 'm going to get you , come on , take the <unk> and help us . ''
<unk> goes with the <unk> path .
on the bottom of the bottom , the <unk> of the citadel is being pulled into the <unk> , and over the left , and already in the early days .
good , think , a <unk> , which is that .
it 's morning .
again , a <unk> <unk> , on the wall of the citadel , this time is black .
you think of enemies , oh , who has two <unk> , you can take something else .
the same scenario , time , this time , it 's the time he knows the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
at the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> , they <unk> in a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us a long time , we do n't think that .
afterwards , the <unk> went down to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
one of the one you have and have the peace of them .
that 's the <unk> <unk> .
i like this idea that everything is what we need , and we have everything .
sometimes it 's <unk> resource , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's little .
but also , we can do something .
we have no idea of power that we have to invent the world every day .
and if you think that this could be a good <unk> , they 're right .
in the spring of the spring .
that 's the thing .
and we know , in <unk> , the snow will get warmer there , the plants of <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
there are blooms of these blooms of these blooms .
there 's an <unk> here that we harvest and eat .
there 's the grain of this grain we can fill and make bread .
there are any animals that eat .
there are people who are eating it later later .
and it 's automatically .
but if you do n't think that 's not that everything is automatically automatically , and it will be a fear and anxious .
and of course , the threat is just a very abstract and just the area of blooms , which is the connection of the flower to plant bees to the plant of the plant of the plant of the plant .
there are the research that show that to <unk> percent of our food , not there if we had no bees .
again , the sounds like that sounds like that , because it 's like normal for us , and we may not see bees as well .
there was a very interesting movie now , <unk> , <unk> .
and i recommend , look at it .
but now let 's look at the lord <unk> of the `` the rejection of the <unk> , '' the <unk> of bees , the meaning of bees <unk> .
this is what he does here on a school at <unk> , and he 's going to tell a few about his work .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
only a big thanks for mr. <unk> and on the whole <unk> .
that 's what i want to do with my project , <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> are a difference of the bees .
and also , under a wing , a wing of a <unk> , which is a little bit about little <unk> people 's fun .
because i 'm going to suppose that the least most of you are <unk> , now it would be a <unk> business in <unk> minutes .
i do n't do that .
but maybe it 's going to be able to start to get that <unk> , or a certain empathy of you to develop them , and to get them to get them for this <unk> , <unk> insect the honey bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i am married with a wonderful woman with a wonderful woman , and he was married , father of five kids and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and adults .
i 'm a member in the <unk> <unk> , and i 'm <unk> in the class of <unk> .
and working on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> with our oldest students in the <unk> .
we are working in the garden in agriculture and in environments .
<unk> is actually a play of <unk> <unk> and is about <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is more a <unk> , a quiet , a quiet thing .
and it leads to the quiet .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not for free is the old greek between honey and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he 's like the <unk> <unk> of his <unk> <unk> to inspire him that he can do again .
but the <unk> does n't go out there , but they send them their blue bees and <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> , and again , in the mouth of the mouth , again , he leaves the words like honey from the <unk> .
a nice picture .
hopefully i do that tonight .
yes .
the flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of these <unk> , this <unk> of my students are built with food <unk> for food <unk> days .
in <unk> schools in the school , in the school , in the school , in the <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> or classrooms in <unk> .
the teacher who is accompanied this project to me in the class , and we 're looking for a piece of place for a <unk> .
most of the window that the children can see something during this month .
and in all of those things , the bees , the bees that are inside the hose and again .
that 's where the window becomes an open place .
so .
and then the whole thing begins to me on the <unk> .
so i 'm going to take a <unk> and <unk> from a existing <unk> of two <unk> , and now <unk> them in these <unk> .
so on this part of this <unk> , so <unk> are bees .
also , we have <unk> <unk> , and here needs to be fresh <unk> , so fresh eggs .
and just a <unk> , here 's the top .
there 's the honey .
you need , bad weather , and they ca n't fly .
so .
that 's what it looks like .
and then the <unk> comes back here , and instantly the transport space is going to move around for the school in the school .
and now , something wonderful .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees in the class , suddenly , suddenly , a crisis .
their people is not more .
they are lonely .
they do n't find their queen .
and that 's the most important challenge of the <unk> , if he 's going to make this <unk> on the u.s. the queen 's in the old people .
so that 's not on this two <unk> .
and they become sad , these bees .
they start to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says she <unk> .
you hear that .
they 're almost more likely higher than they 're looking at a queen with a queen .
and now , a street view begins .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , they 're going to move the need to find a new people , and the whole thing has happened without <unk> , <unk> , without conferences , without conversations , without discussions , without opinion , without opinion , and <unk> .
here 's the people agree , and then you get a <unk> in the first night .
because without queen , this people would not exist in six weeks .
because <unk> life for six weeks .
so .
and in this first night , they get a pen out of a <unk> and bring it into this <unk> .
and then there 's a <unk> .
everyone who had been <unk> from high school in high school , says this is supposed to go ?
yes , genetically modified , is all genetically modified .
that 's true .
and now , something wonderful .
now , this <unk> , which would have become a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
the egg is the first three times the same genetic code like the <unk> .
after that , after the age of a <unk> <unk> .
you know this term .
and immediately that is changing the genetic code on the genetic code .
the <unk> will change the <unk> into the <unk> .
we had heard this before what we eat , which is determines what 's going to eat .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
so three days , five days <unk> .
and this is the students all <unk> .
that 's what you see in class .
and then this cell will be <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and then the whole thing is not going to happen , because the people say , or because one of the people say , or you 're supposed to be like this , or you 're going to say , or you 're going to say , you do it .
no , this is happening .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> gun .
and then the students ' students waiting for eight days of my students , three five eight , three eight , three eight , three five <unk> gave me the queen that this queen <unk> .
and so the day , when that 's supposed to happen , the teachers <unk> the title in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the middle morning , yes .
and then the mom says , `` well , what is this with you ?
yes , i have to school in school .
yes , why ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yes ?
and then the morning are six in school .
and then the <unk> <unk> on this <unk> , because they want to <unk> the queen now .
and if you really do this , you can hear it first .
this is the queen <unk> .
so .
another higher .
and then the <unk> and <unk> are the queen .
the first thing that the queen is , it 's expanding their wings and there 's now with their <unk> of the <unk> that own the queen , their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> .
the people now has a identity .
now , three to five days after five days .
from the <unk> , you get your <unk> <unk> .
on the back , the bat is out of the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days , these queen is <unk> beyond the <unk> .
so some think , i 've seen this already have a <unk> in the <unk> .
wait , <unk> .
what 's completely different .
so .
this is the queen that is driving alone , without <unk> , without <unk> , from this <unk> , to two kilometers up .
i certainly have seen in your zeppelin .
in the <unk> , there 's a <unk> <unk> , now , seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the other way around islam , where the guy can have the queen here is the queen who has 12 men .
and the whole thing happens in a wonderful way of flight .
the drone is coming from the back of the back , the queen , and this queen is <unk> all the time that you need to put down seeds for three years .
for the drone , it 's an amazing experience .
if you get killed with the <unk> , you 're dead at the sky .
and then the queen comes back and starts to lay eggs .
there 's always one , two students in the class that see that immediately .
they also see the queen immediately .
yes .
and then it ends up the project to school , because the <unk> and the queen and the queen and the <unk> is going to be inside there .
and then i came up to this <unk> .
<unk> ' <unk> from the outside , and the next morning i <unk> on the queen and the honey bees to me on the <unk> .
and here you see the queen .
yes .
<unk> <unk> .
and the amount of all 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then of course , these two <unk> are coming here now .
in a process , in a prey , and now this people can be big and powerful .
why are bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen the children who have experienced that never heard more .
yes .
there 's not just that in this class , then the students are together with the bees , but the whole school is in this class .
and the teacher when he knows something if he can just get something that if he has a prepared to join the others .
look at these , bees and <unk> years ago , we have a cave paintings where people have covered the honey .
a few months ago in israel , a few years ago in israel that people have considered the bees .
any human culture has lived with bees .
or the reverse , the bees were with every culture .
china , in india , in egypt , in greece in rome .
they were all over the same .
ladies and gentlemen , <unk> .
it can be a <unk> , a <unk> game , he can join a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , what flowers or trees are the bees <unk> what they need ?
that 's where they find something out now , now in the summer , in agriculture .
that 's out there , this is a green desert for our bees .
yes ?
he can go through the students in the <unk> , and the flowers get able to <unk> bees on the table of <unk> , and look at how long we need to do the <unk> of my flowers ?
how long are you on the individual blooms ?
and how long you need to come back to you again .
it can be <unk> <unk> .
how do i <unk> a <unk> ?
yes .
you know , whether this is that the tip of the top , or <unk> flat page is on top ?
look carefully .
he can be a mathematics -- a <unk> join .
ladies and gentlemen , he can actually discover the students <unk> on the <unk> .
and then he comes to the question , the karl <unk> had the nobel prize for the nobel prize ?
because he gave the bees in the hive .
but ladies and gentlemen , in a beehive , it 's <unk> .
there 's not a bee either .
and only the professor of the professor <unk> , who has taught in <unk> university in the university of <unk> , found that the bees can create a <unk> <unk> .
like a <unk> web from the unfolding of the <unk> , and now with <unk> hertz , the bees and the bees , the bees , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , with your legs , with your legs , with your <unk> .
see what these bees are doing in school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they lose your fear of bees .
and develop a awareness of the bees .
they learn , look at <unk> , look at what the bees are doing .
and they get a warning of those creatures that basically lives for us for people .
the bees can not be a kilo of a year per people in the year .
<unk> years ago , the only opportunity to make candles .
they accumulate the <unk> outside of the trees .
that 's a <unk> , with the <unk> of your people .
and now you imagine , in the summer , this is <unk> -- <unk> bees on such a tight space , at <unk> degrees .
hey , there are <unk> without end .
no , not the bees .
because they have natural antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and it 's <unk> it , it becomes <unk> , it becomes a <unk> <unk> .
somebody who is on the <unk> revolution , and pneumonia , <unk> <unk> can go to a <unk> , <unk> <unk> out of the people .
of course , of course , there is a <unk> in front of them and with <unk> with a <unk> , and so on , there is nothing .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , of course , the bees <unk> the bees , and we would have less apples , if the bees were not going to fly , or we would have to do the chinese <unk> on the
there 's a lot more <unk> .
look at the <unk> , because the meadow on the meadow is that the cows eat .
and there 's the bee , and they get your nectar and <unk> of these <unk> .
and now the cow is going to be the cow and it 's <unk> the <unk> , and it 's just because they 're <unk> <unk> , can digest <unk> .
yes ?
and then she <unk> that and notice , ah , i got <unk> , ah , i can get it back .
and then there is milk .
that 's what the bee is .
yes ?
and of course , the bee of the bee gives us the most valuable thing to the nature of nature .
the honey .
i 'm going to get close to the point , <unk> .
my students are looking at every year every year , and then they 're going to be building these <unk> , and then to go together with me together .
this is not my <unk> , but i had a students , and i told you in the school of college , and i told you , `` you know , <unk> ' <unk> .
and then he says , `` well , i have hot <unk> . ''
i come from <unk> from <unk> , and i 'm two years .
and i 've been in <unk> for five years , and for two years , in the thomas <unk> .
and i 'm really excited that i have to learn more with <unk> , but with the hands of learning .
<unk> , yes , with your head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> college .
and more than half , oh yeah , yeah , we want .
my students are going to experience a huge appreciation and the space between , in <unk> , ordinary and the <unk> people are <unk> by the bees .
on the <unk> , you encounter themselves , and they get self-confidence , my students and a conscience .
how does you get the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you would have to say , how do you get the <unk> ?
and in fact , i think there 's the human being <unk> , and there 's a new <unk> .
and he says , that 's what happens .
at the end of a little poem from <unk> <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun through the <unk> of the end of the flower , and never the direction that the fields are losing the fields in <unk> <unk> as he was diagnosed with .
thank you very much .
hi , love friends in all the world .
welcome to my project .
the project and my wife .
it 's the fight for the end of female <unk> .
in my eyes , the biggest crime of humanity , because it has been <unk> for <unk> .
the society against the women who are still <unk> sacrifices per day .
first of all i 'm looking at .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg ,
there 's been <unk> years old .
you can think that i 'm not thinking about the job .
i felt not <unk> .
and so i was happy to ask me that i could go to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
for example , this .
with a massive <unk> of africa from africa .
on the <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> indians on the last <unk> indians stop the <unk> indians .
this was a journey where i was more <unk> than <unk> , more <unk> than <unk> .
but nevertheless , these were able to find the interest of media , and even a little person i could bring to the world to the world .
in fact , i was <unk> , <unk> in ethiopia .
in fact , war between <unk> and ethiopia and we were <unk> there .
and despite all the cruelty that we saw , we were experiencing the infinite hospitality of <unk> , the <unk> hospitality of <unk> , arab hospitality .
and twice the time that we were born , and our two <unk> that you see there is , with their bodies as a live <unk> of us in front of us , and the <unk> that are my
if you have to kill them through us .
something like i was found in no other culture .
and in boys , in boys , that you ca n't reduce islam on terrorism .
christians are not going to be reduced to the terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather than the true values like love , social responsibility .
these are the values to fight .
for a lot of years , i 've been again in that <unk> , with my wife .
and then we stopped <unk> female <unk> .
when i heard that <unk> percent of the everyday casualties are the rest of the everyday victims , the rest are christians and <unk> ' `` <unk> , '' i thought about how to be a <unk> like islam , and that 's the same more inconvenient
and the idea was born the highest <unk> of islam to explain the practice to the sin .
we were looking at <unk> for germans who are not found .
so we would like to suggest that we were completely <unk> , that islam is not <unk> .
you would have me <unk> the throat .
on top of <unk> international international , we started <unk> our own organization .
and they were from <unk> and <unk> .
and to do this , we need to win images .
it was the lack of .
and therefore , <unk> and i went back into the desert about hidden cameras .
the bad bloody pictures that i do n't show you , but i want to <unk> the crime .
fourteen weeks at the age of four weeks to <unk> , at the end of your parents and <unk> , on the earth you put on the limbs , and in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> with <unk> instruments without <unk> and anatomy and anatomy and anatomy .
so what 's left is a space of size of a <unk> .
so <unk> takes a <unk> .
if you just <unk> your rule , you have two weeks .
in fact , historically , <unk> destroyed and soul , their dignity .
this was the beginning of the <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> , it 's going on .
the man has to open it .
he never seen a <unk> woman .
the <unk> , said , `` well , <unk> , is not a problem .
you 're <unk> your penis with <unk> , and then you poke hard .
and if you ca n't make it , not bad .
then you take the knife and <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> .
a third of the girls die .
this one was three months ago .
<unk> has lost his language .
these are the <unk> , some in asia .
most of us is <unk> .
and when we asked muslims , why did you do that ?
was the <unk> answer that we have to do that is in the koran .
nothing in the koran is in the opposite .
everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> every day , the creator , the creator , is perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe what you pray .
they 're <unk> <unk> to be a <unk> of women 's wrong , and why is why they could be <unk> , <unk> women .
but now we had the images of the first <unk> to this <unk> .
he <unk> us to have his <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there were hard conversations , two days .
but we had the health care of our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the great decision , the practice is against all human rights , against religion , we have to ban him .
as last , the wise <unk> has signed up this new <unk> .
and if you know africa , and you know , you know , you know , that 's what they have done for these people .
and it became celebrated and the successes we had in other countries .
quick example of time , <unk> of the country , the highest spiritual , the <unk> of the country , the <unk> of the country , the <unk> of the country is that it 's a crime , to write a crime , write on <unk> , and now carry on the <unk> .
for weeks , weeks , we were on our own <unk> .
a hundred aluminum <unk> .
and where we came , we have open ears , open poor and the historical , holy hospitality .
and when we wanted to go to the country , she said , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you really want to do all the <unk> countries ?
so much is not going to be <unk> .
he 's right .
i 'm a gamer , and i have to get it slowly .
and in fact , he had a idea .
he said if you 're going to make you the ten <unk> muslims of the world and the explain to the practice of the sin , it 's a sin .
<unk> , and i flew to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and i went to the <unk> of the <unk> .
and in <unk> for <unk> the <unk> , his <unk> <unk> <unk> , we got a <unk> <unk> .
he was listening to the idea of what we can do that we would have to do that .
and that 's what we 're just going to help us support ourselves .
and then he said , i wo n't just get the conference like we had asked him , but i 'll take the <unk> .
and that 's what he did .
over cairo <unk> <unk> , our transparent .
international <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of female bodies .
under the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and everybody came .
a hundred <unk> , but the highest of the world .
in the middle of the <unk> islands , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and in the rest of europe is the cause of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so men can decide life and death .
but just the others .
on the left of the left side , the <unk> of the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest world .
in fact , i 'm just making a vacuum and <unk> personal .
and i did all <unk> .
it started the conference .
and below our sign on the <unk> of the left of the left of the left of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of egypt , egypt <unk> mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for me , islam is not <unk> .
we had the doctors <unk> the way to their way , which is a terrible thing to do with the <unk> .
and then they could show <unk> , <unk> .
reality .
men had <unk> eyes .
they moved back behind <unk> doors for two hours , and i wrote a <unk> , <unk> .
the <unk> is the cameras , analyzed what you chose .
and the most important one , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime in the highest values of islam .
he <unk> the <unk> .
we thought the job was done , but the bill has done without our <unk> .
because the shame to talk about the <unk> of the woman is stronger than any mind .
that 's why we have <unk> .
we have this conference in this called the golden book .
one <unk> for the world 's world .
and because the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , it was so good , who has been blessed with a <unk> .
it 's going to put us out of hands .
we had to work in many countries with the highest <unk> .
and they read this with interest , so they were thrilled to have a book .
but most of the things that i did n't have the courage to make a <unk> .
you can not talk about the bedside .
just a few people have <unk> the courage .
they went to the universities , on <unk> .
and sometimes we have found some <unk> <unk> in the mosque about what 's going on here .
and then it goes beyond speakers in the <unk> .
and these are the subjects .
that 's the spread .
but i 'm going to have time .
it 's all <unk> on hot stones , and i work on many other strategies , this topic .
the practice <unk> .
but my <unk> that would be this .
i want to announce the great message the highest <unk> of the world in the fall of islam on the kaaba in mecca .
not so <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
when there are four million people together , men and women and women <unk> islamic parts .
and then i <unk> that with all of that , and the <unk> king , my transparent , between the <unk> <unk> .
so as i 've been trained to the <unk> .
unfortunately , the last <unk> , i mean , the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure when he 's going to <unk> that .
for example , to help these women .
for the other hand , to show the world which is the true values of islam instead of being able to let me just <unk> .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i ca n't do this , i may have a <unk> of what i had in hamburg would have been <unk> .
so at least , at least many <unk> in the mosques in all the world .
and we could get our transparent .
and maybe i 'll be able to be that little girl has to be more <unk> .
then my life has been worth right .
and i want to say , and i 'm going to have heard that now , and you 've seen to you .
it 's not a <unk> .
we have to go to the purchasing power , and i do n't get out of this stage here .
and now i want to end up to you the design of my friend 's design .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and that 's in all the <unk> in the name of the name of the name of the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the needs of the <unk> .
we also have it in german .
female <unk> is <unk> with the koran and the ethic of islam .
it 's <unk> and a discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i start .
that 's what the <unk> did you have been in germany .
on the <unk> , my mom , my brother and i had a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
my mom was thrilled , because they did n't understand why the <unk> of food .
the third day we 've been trained .
we got the trash to get it back to a <unk> woman , and it 's just the <unk> of <unk> .
she tried to explain it , you can eat .
that 's not <unk> .
that tastes very well .
it 's cheese .
my mom moved the <unk> and laughing .
cheese .
in my own country , we have to click on that one .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
fifteen years ago , my mom and my brother fled china .
from this escape , i 'm going to tell you today .
but importantly , this is about the people that people have allowed the escape and made a success story .
but first i 'm going to tell you where i come from .
i 'm a <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> that live in the middle of china .
and this region is called the chinese area called <unk> .
it 's about six miles away from germany .
china is a total of 10 million <unk> , but in <unk> , the largest <unk> community outside china .
and this is why that <unk> life is because we need to suffer through china .
hundreds of thousands of chinese chinese have been <unk> in our own home .
our own native language , <unk> has been replaced by education system .
in schools , in universities , only as chinese .
and our religion is not to <unk> us .
they 're losing their culture and identity .
and if someone is courageous , and for the rights of the rights of the <unk> , for example , or even death .
that was the reason why my parents decided to escape our kids .
this was <unk> , and i was 11 years old .
this is a little bit about our race .
we did n't have enough money , so my father had to be behind it .
i 'm involved in a lot of people who helped us have the escape .
i 'm <unk> for many images .
but i 'm going to look at me at first of our <unk> <unk> .
i actually <unk> him just when i <unk> my eyes .
he was big with a lot of <unk> , still and we met him with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first one has been <unk> .
i know that many a bad picture of <unk> is that the only way that they want to make refugees .
but i 'm going to say , `` i call it <unk> as a <unk> , '' not as a <unk> .
because <unk> has <unk> us .
he stood at the airport in <unk> airport on a <unk> , and he said to the last conclusion , whether we really were safely through the <unk> .
airport airport , and i know , and i know , like my mom 's way to me just went out of the airport .
do n't tell you .
down to us .
because i had a pass in my hand , and i was my photo inside , <unk> , <unk> .
i had to have a <unk> of the <unk> .
and i <unk> myself to <unk> me on the hand .
silence .
marcus : sweat .
a long view .
we finally became <unk> .
in <unk> , i came up with a lot of <unk> that kind of <unk> us .
i was <unk> to the <unk> woman who has used to us with us with us .
in a <unk> , with four <unk> of 13 families .
at least 40 children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was strangers .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to share a <unk> .
there was eaten , and <unk> did .
friends were not to visit because i was living where we used .
only my <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> know .
she knew my story and the <unk> of me , they were looking for me .
for example , they brought me to <unk> <unk> what i do n't do .
but it also helped me meet german <unk> .
i spent my whole bunch of puberty .
that was not easy for my mom .
for us , with kids , with children , and still in the uncertainty , because we were just a <unk> , and we could n't get a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> that i was very , very <unk> to the time .
it 's also a little embarrassing , which now tell you all , but now i just have to stand my story .
i was very aggressive , and i had to focus on my school .
first of the first time we got to have a sudden , where we came to regular children with regular children .
with normal , my kids who did n't have to live in a living room .
i also <unk> myself to the <unk> and <unk> my brother or <unk> .
it 's just about this one .
i also <unk> myself to several <unk> <unk> <unk> , because our parents could n't do german .
they just <unk> .
we 're very happy .
i know how we stood out of the fence and wait for those people , because , somehow , <unk> people took time for us , and that was important .
after two years , my father finally came to germany .
but the problem is that he was right from <unk> <unk> , because it was no place for <unk> .
i 'm <unk> to keep the very high lawyer who managed to keep my father before china , and he managed to keep it into us in <unk> lives .
i 'm <unk> to this time where i really was very , very happy , because after six years , we had to pull out in a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we finally had a own apartment with a own <unk> and a own kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was very small , and i had no desk in , but it was good , i could close my door .
and i 'm <unk> that i used to have the time , but i still had to leave the <unk> <unk> .
i really do n't look at me .
there was a <unk> institute that has been supported in the <unk> , and it still has still made the idea that i can get over the second <unk> .
first of the <unk> <unk> .
so i thanks to the teacher that really believed in me , and i was not just the time i made it to the middle <unk> .
and i came to <unk> .
and before i went to the <unk> , i was playing with my best friend of my best friend .
<unk> is a organization or a cultural organized system .
but i was not just a good <unk> that i 've done because we had a place where we could just go .
we had a <unk> where we could <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
and the board of <unk> helped us have to tell us our issues , and he was <unk> , and he could kind of <unk> us .
and then i came to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where young people without having a college teacher , which is artistic connected .
so that really did n't have done very well , and i realized art is a little bit more <unk> .
by <unk> and contact with contact a filmmaker , a filmmaker came on us .
he made the film <unk> over the life of my friends and me .
and the film won lots of awards .
we realized that people were interested in our history .
he was very special , because we 've never experienced that people listened to us .
and that was a moment i thought , okay .
i do n't want to get more <unk> .
i want to make something out of my life .
a <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees to come to the idea of <unk> to a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
but there 's a <unk> building in the building me , and i ended up to a game , and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was exactly right .
i played .
and the great thing is that after a performance of two editors ' <unk> <unk> <unk> on me .
and i wanted to ask me if i would have been interested in my own interest .
i thought , great , <unk> .
i 'm sure .
and i made the <unk> <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and one of my <unk> <unk> across the world i was able to put themselves into the european <unk> .
and i actually won him .
now , i study the university of grad school and film <unk> in the third year , and i 'm <unk> of the <unk> .
and it would n't have been possible for me if not each or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> are actually used for me .
they have made me open spaces , they have opened me ways i could have my seat in society .
and i 'm going to come to you .
each of you have the opportunity to get people like me to get a second chance , and find your life in society .
because the people , every day come from a hundred refugees from <unk> and each of them are full of hope and every one of them has a big potential .
you have a lot of determination to let me behind them .
and with this determination , you could really be big profit for germany , and for every single one of us .
and i could actually tell you a thousand things that you can do , but i ca n't have any time , even though there 's a minute , i brought you a <unk> .
now , <unk> your cell you ca n't tell me that they ca n't <unk> code .
you scan the code and then come on the page of <unk> with a lot of feedback that you can do .
and that would help us help us .
i 'm going to do it for your commitment , and we hopefully look outside .
and you scan the code .
i mean .
many people do n't have the cell in the hand .
are you going to be virtuous , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> .
only one more <unk> <unk> .
so i 'm happy to have contact .
my name is robin .
my <unk> is writing easier than it speaks .
i come from austria , that 's in vienna .
but i 'm going to be very , to be <unk> today , really beautiful here .
i 'm in fact that every time .
and this is not a phrase that 's a feeling .
yes , in contrast , unlike the other <unk> , i 'm not here to <unk> you about anything .
i did n't know what .
but it 's so i think i write texts that i write in my leisure , and then it 's sort of talk to talk anywhere in <unk> , or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
yes , and i was also asked to read some texts to read the whole program a little bit .
and that 's exactly what i 'm going to do .
yes .
i start with a joke .
make two chicken .
so one , you know , this is two english people i 'm going to do , so i ca n't <unk> it and <unk> , but <unk> already i 'm going to be <unk> and <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
tell the other guy .
dan <unk> ca n't be <unk> .
so here we have done the level .
the first text is a little <unk> that i wrote .
i got a piece of person who is part of what that means .
it 's wearing the title .
and she did n't understand it .
when your head was in my lap , your rest was under my ceiling .
my leg was under my ceiling under my ceiling was outside the ceiling .
my leg was through the ceiling .
it 's about the head of my lap , the rest of your lap , the rest of your <unk> , my leg below the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling .
that has <unk> , when my leg was extremely high .
it was very romantic .
the next text made me a person to tell me very much .
that 's my grandpa .
we have no longer touch .
my <unk> grandfather was a local spiderman .
already as a child he did with love <unk> .
just like me , yeah .
yes , <unk> text .
better .
jesus is the only flying on the <unk> of the bus .
but where he was when he should be saving to save the <unk> of the <unk> ?
is to think , right ?
did i put my <unk> ?
second text .
the next text is a little bit longer .
it 's actually a half a year .
so writing .
read faster .
is the beginning of a novel i 'm going to write .
ah , it 's about <unk> guy , so the adventures of a guy who 's always <unk> and a little bit of <unk> .
but i 'm always making me out of this point of view from the <unk> of the <unk> .
because i never <unk> the hair .
chapter one .
if i get <unk> empty .
that 's empty as the slate he 's now trying to fill .
yeah , i ca n't come .
a very strong thing .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't understand it .
i 'm very difficult for me .
and that 's what i 'm going to play with my lexicon and with my language .
i always like to play with me .
and yes , we get things out .
it 's wearing the title .
it 's a little strange thing .
so probably the <unk> <unk> i wrote .
we can do that .
yes , we <unk> .
we can .
we <unk> .
and i ca n't know .
but i can .
i ca n't have .
i ca n't .
and i did n't understand it .
no idea .
yes , yeah , <unk> from me .
i always tell you , either or no one .
the next piece of paper has to do with text .
it 's kind of a little <unk> .
i was written by insects .
very polite .
yes , <unk> text .
is a little <unk> .
and the only thing about it is cool if i could say that you could say .
my text is made the title , good things are cool .
so life is <unk> <unk> .
we 've got <unk> <unk> .
so <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and then it 's going to be better and yes , it was .
beautiful moment .
yes , even more <unk> , this is another one .
and that 's about the time that 's cool when i 'm going to do all the way that we could make all kinds of <unk> , so we try that all .
that 's exactly what the wind is going to do .
the text is <unk> the title , and this is the way .
yes .
power is fun .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i like to write little <unk> .
this is a <unk> <unk> pun .
<unk> is written by <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ?
yes , yeah .
power is fun .
yes , another sentence .
this is written in <unk> .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's virtually impossible to explain , <unk> in <unk> , that 's the point .
here 's another text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he already known it before i had it as a <unk> .
he was diagnosed me on his short , afterwards he would let me go .
i could give me in him later .
i did the joy .
it 's a <unk> of all the other days and put me back to me again .
with a <unk> <unk> where otherwise ?
and it 's not to minimize him by telling me .
and i was going to wake up a wake up later it 's not a <unk> day .
is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what albert einstein is meant to his steak ?
i 'm <unk> .
so .
letter <unk> sounds like the cow .
so this is funny .
yes , the next text has been learned the paper .
it 's more about the political political .
so , i do n't write funny things .
i write a political thing .
and in fact , i often ask me to ask me what i 'm going to do .
and , yes , i just written this text here .
he 's carrying the title of <unk> .
my father came from vienna , and then in my mom and i from her .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thank you very much for the sound .
yes , i 'd like to make a little advertising .
i ca n't make any business or so , therefore i have to do that .
and i 'm also <unk> myself , and i also make a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
let me show you .
and i 'm <unk> , i 'm actually <unk> .
and , yes .
i just want to say that .
it goes on the program .
more ads .
this is a little advertising i wrote .
feet .
rich in vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin <unk> .
it 's very funny .
i like to write a joke about your girlfriend 's book , but the <unk> was just flat .
yes , it 's not a <unk> .
for example , you 're <unk> , to stop the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of it .
yes .
thank you very much for listening .
she was great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me start with a <unk> question .
why is you going to do <unk> ?
i think everybody , the tax tax tax , would be wondering if he can give you at least one of the society of society .
the answer is clear .
now we know , the life expectancy of time is only about the time of the birth to about <unk> percent of the time .
that 's going to be any environmental environmental , <unk> the influence on <unk> .
why do we know so little ?
why will we were bombarded by <unk> news from the <unk> of each other ?
it 's all about six years ago .
it was fat .
you thought , when you see fat from food , we 're all <unk> and become healthy old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> has led to <unk> <unk> in american fashion , and what has changed that the americans have become thicker every year .
then you said , ah , no .
not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
and then what the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and that led .
so it 's going to be <unk> new <unk> <unk> through the village .
where the <unk> ?
well , the reason , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , at least , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , for me , at least , at least , at least , at least , for me , at least , at least , for me , at least , for me , at least , for me , at least , for me , at least , for me , at least , for me , at least , for me , at least , at least , at least , for example , that we 're <unk> through <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
for example , for example , there is a <unk> .
they all know the <unk> .
<unk> wrote a new kind of <unk> magazine .
the top <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for this year .
keith richards was seven years for seven years .
then the newspaper .
or this lady here .
<unk> <unk> .
the oldest person who has ever lived in the earth .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's people who claim they are six , but just <unk> your <unk> .
<unk> <unk> has actually become <unk> .
and she stopped thinking about <unk> <unk> to smoke again to follow the path of virtue and stop smoking .
they have passed .
what does this tell us ?
not that cigarettes are healthy .
but it tells us that more difficult is that we need clean statistics , we need to need a simple experimental systems and we have to ask simple questions .
this is a very simple question , and a whole simple thing about different countries is women , women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it .
so that 's the testosterone that is produced in the male <unk> .
and there are <unk> proof of that men are just like women .
now everyone can start thinking about themselves , whether this is a <unk> <unk> .
austria is a free country .
but it 's better tips , not fear .
we 're not interested in <unk> relationships with <unk> .
sounds complicated , but just just to illustrate the <unk> of <unk> .
so there 's a lot of your <unk> grandma , and ask what they did or do they become as old ?
ah .
grandma 's 10 cigarettes .
this is the secret of your age , right ?
you may not have 10 cigarettes .
or you have <unk> and grandma , without grandma , without the 10 cigarettes .
even hard statistics are not always <unk> .
for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , is very strong statistics that shows that people who are going to be used to be older than people who do n't do that .
<unk> .
is <unk> .
is that the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because people just have enough money in your pocket .
but if i 'm going to give a group of <unk> a <unk> , and this group is alive for 20 percent less than <unk> , but otherwise , i actually got a <unk> factor in food .
and in fact , these attempts have been done .
so you have to tell you , the <unk> is very <unk> what i agree with my enemies is that <unk> <unk> can spread the life .
and this works for a different organisms .
for example , at bacteria .
you can see this <unk> of bacteria .
when we looked at the <unk> , in the <unk> line , that 's the pretty much longer .
the same is true for <unk> , worms and recently , just about two years ago , in the u.s. , it 's even for monkeys .
it 's not about being thin .
it 's also working with <unk> <unk> .
and this is another experiment , which has done in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you 've taken with a <unk> , and that 's what we call a <unk> , a <unk> diet , and so you have so many <unk> and night .
and the wonder is , the mice has become dick , <unk> and <unk> , bad <unk> and bad <unk> .
now , now you 've got a lot of parallel <unk> , and that 's exactly the same amount of <unk> cups that was a break .
there 's nothing to eat in the day , that they eat twice as much .
and these <unk> is <unk> and healthy and it does n't have a <unk> .
and both of these mice were <unk> .
both have a lot of time .
it 's a sick and the other healthy .
what happens here ?
it will be a process called <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
when they do organisms , or cells , the organism will start looking at the organism , <unk> constituents in the cell or <unk> <unk> to make energy .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see the cell in the cell , mainly <unk> , <unk> to the age of the age .
the <unk> of the <unk> that are <unk> the constituents and the cell as energy <unk> .
and that 's what happens to the age of the old <unk> in borders .
this is a molecular molecular <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
so , in order to <unk> <unk> these lives in different organisms .
and it 's probably going to assume that this works for people .
and we 're learning that they used to recommend in <unk> , every little bit of <unk> on the day , <unk> <unk> .
no .
but you want to say if you have hunger , ah , maybe the <unk> turned on .
welcome your hunger like a friend .
and that also makes sense .
as <unk> point nine nine percent of human history , the human being did when he had hunger ?
that 's exactly what he did .
we keep the fridge when we have hunger .
and that 's safe in biology .
now we know , of course , of course , and this is already in the bible , in <unk> <unk> <unk> , the mind is ready , but the meat is weak .
paradise looks very different from us .
here 's already <unk> <unk> in a medieval garden .
the three <unk> here is good , that 's all the food all day .
and this is the real <unk> .
so we were looking at the search of freedom that is the molecular response of the <unk> , though the organism eat .
that could be interesting for people whose <unk> are not enough , just <unk> <unk> .
and maybe we could keep us the most difficult <unk> of life .
so the question is , we can the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , even though you eat ?
and we have a lot of a hundred , on the thousand substances , natural <unk> .
we have found that is called <unk> .
<unk> is a substance which is naturally confined in all organisms , but also in all organisms in all organisms .
in the skin , it 's <unk> .
<unk> people have already been less <unk> in the skin .
and if we give <unk> on human cells , for example , you see here .
that 's the <unk> cell here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus of the <unk> , and we see a lot of thousand of these little <unk> of this little <unk> in the cell , which is <unk> during the age of the age .
<unk> cells would look like that .
and this works in different organisms .
for example , this is a <unk> .
so we 've found the molecular material <unk> <unk> <unk> .
for life , organisms .
and the answer is , you see here is a <unk> picture of a <unk> .
it 's simple <unk> .
after <unk> days , everybody 's dead , after <unk> days , half dead .
when we give <unk> into the drinking water , the animals are getting older and survival .
we also know that human cells that we 've been <unk> <unk> , in culture is about three times as long as we put them with <unk> .
and latest research also put that even the life of mice is being distributed through <unk> .
and is not just life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now , of course , of course , you want to know where is that <unk> ?
like the name already says , it 's been discovered in sperm , there is it in very high concentrations .
but i can cheer them to cheer them to <unk> <unk> pepper <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a product of <unk> <unk> , which is bad in japan , which is so <unk> <unk> .
we then said , if we 're going to help <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> the junk used to <unk> it for <unk> ?
and you have to know that the common denominator of all pancreatic disease is that during the age of the human being <unk> in the brain .
and we did it in fact experiments .
you will wonder , we made the fruit flies .
so fruit flies will be <unk> if you 're old .
you have more <unk> in the brain when they 're old .
and the molecular mechanisms that are very similar to the memory of memory are very similar to people .
now you ask , the guy has measured the memory of fruit flies ?
this is the experiment that we 've done with stefan seals by the university of berlin .
they take a hundred fruit fruit lights , and you give you a <unk> that you love .
<unk> .
and let 's look at this <unk> .
then you fly the same kind of flying , give you in the next chamber , and give you other things that you love , which is what they 're doing .
we let it enjoy the <unk> while they <unk> it .
classical <unk> .
and then you take the same flying fly .
so the driving goes down in the <unk> , there 's the .
and if you get down here , you give you one side of one page and move from others .
where do they all go ?
sure .
<unk> .
except for the two .
this is the <unk> .
or , say , you have character .
i love my <unk> , and i do n't let me <unk> this <unk> reward .
okay .
but is this form of character that 's growing at age .
not just in flying .
and we could actually get the <unk> of flying <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and the <unk> that were used in the brain , they were <unk> again .
that means , <unk> is not only about aging , but also against <unk> diseases , perhaps .
and that 's important , because we do n't mention the lifespan 's lifespan .
it does n't make sense of <unk> the time .
and i do n't want to leave you without even a few hands-on tips we might remain younger .
again , <unk> <unk> .
it 's not about the weight , or whatever .
there 's a <unk> of <unk> people who eats a day and eat a day .
this is the so-called <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and that 's very good at all .
this is called <unk> .
avoid <unk> .
it 's not a bad carbs not to be dangerous .
it 's really about candy .
you know , you know that <unk> <unk> are , diabetes disease , even if you 're sleek .
and you know that sugar can accelerate the growth of tumors .
this is <unk> <unk> that 's <unk> .
after 30 days , everybody 's dead .
it 's a little <unk> of glucose <unk> .
to create a <unk> effect .
there 's only one example that works in almost all organisms .
they eat vegetables and vegetables .
avoid the gift of too much <unk> or <unk> .
you know , you know , <unk> -- and <unk> cancer .
this is not under vitamin d .
we may have a <unk> of the wintertime , and vitamin d is <unk> on the skin .
you know , for example , you 're going to be at least three times a week .
cigarettes , despite the <unk> of <unk> examples , they have 10 to 15 years .
and they 're going to do it in times the <unk> of the eternal <unk> .
the impact of pray and blood pressure is <unk> .
because the monks of life is almost like women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , life longer than <unk> .
<unk> life longer than <unk> .
but <unk> life are still more than <unk> .
only <unk> die as a <unk> .
what is that ?
people think that what has to do with some substances .
there 's no way to do that , that 's very simple .
so now , when now , the window of the window is the window of the window that i 'm going to go on with <unk> <unk> solution .
and what happens is probably going to happen in your <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> and so what you 're going to do is <unk> .
therefore , alcohol 's <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> partner is associated with longevity .
they should live in a much <unk> street .
now you think about <unk> .
but that has nothing to do with <unk> .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure a closer <unk> street , the more <unk> in the blood .
and also , if he says , i got used to it .
i ca n't sleep well , and the noise does n't do anything .
not .
he has more <unk> in the blood , and that 's bad .
sunlight should be limited because of course , of course .
we now know that <unk> is very good metabolic effects .
especially we can reduce the <unk> down .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> are <unk> against the <unk> .
so , by the way , we knew our grandmothers have been <unk> with <unk> and so forth .
not a sense of mind .
several studies show that dark chocolate can rise against dementia .
recently recently , a nice study that showed that a nice letter that is <unk> <unk> a day of <unk> a day of a <unk> .
so this is what you think of coffee here is a little bit of sand here .
there are studies that show that there are studies that do n't show that .
what is clear is that coffee <unk> <unk> <unk> and therefore improved your metabolic performance .
and coffee is also a good news project , because he solves crazy <unk> , what we could show up with <unk> <unk> in paris .
so , a very nice and intricate study in a hundred thousand people have been looking for fifteen years , that people who are eating <unk> kids to eat their numbers to 20 percent .
this is a huge value for serious study .
and this is true of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but it 's not the case for peanuts .
they just call them nuts , okay ?
but these are actually beans .
so you ca n't have peanuts .
the next point is a little bit dodgy .
avoid the shot of a <unk> protein , so of meat and dairy , but only if you 're between <unk> and <unk> years old .
so this is a very nice new new study that you 're going to take a lot of animal proteins that you 're going to take that strong as if they were a huge <unk> .
that 's not the time for time after the animal proteins are good , and of course , it 's not for <unk> kids or adolescents , the animal proteins , and it 's not for pregnant and those who will be
it 's mostly <unk> .
anyway , what you do , you know , it 's already <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the joyful disbelief the <unk> are signs of health .
everything boils down in the medical school .
this is the gentleman , <unk> <unk> , and he lived in this regime , and it 's <unk> years old .
he 's coming out of my home from my <unk> , never getting sick .
and it 's very good at him .
he 's not a <unk> rights , but he 's living in a <unk> where there 's especially many healthy <unk> .
he followed about the <unk> <unk> that i 've told you today .
now , we should have been involved in all of the most complex experiments , but we do n't know that big fact .
because the reason that the <unk> of the <unk> of me does n't have a organic but it seems to be a <unk> , and finally a <unk> .
you <unk> the old people less than one of the most <unk> mistake of our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel of <unk> a year ago .
the brothers <unk> .
a work , in the contemporary critics from the teenagers of teenagers .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm going to do .
a question is , where no one has to stand up , because it 's a little <unk> of you who is lonely ?
the <unk> is very low .
less than i thought .
but it probably has some reasons why they did n't have reported that people would have the ones that would be <unk> .
a lot of people are confusing and loneliness and thinking .
and that 's not the case at all .
now , loneliness is actually more likely to be a phenomenon under people .
maybe it 's also because it 's not <unk> because the question is <unk> .
you feel lonely , it 's lonely ?
you can feel like being lonely .
and you can be lonely without feeling lonely .
loneliness to do much with shame .
and also , this is going to have been <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
loneliness is in shame and shame in loneliness .
loneliness is time .
that 's why nobody has signed here in the couple of seconds that i have .
loneliness is <unk> .
loneliness is the time to be conscious .
and loneliness is also trying to talk about this .
and this exercise we do n't own all of them .
we do n't own the language , we have the sign of ourselves when are lonely ?
there 's at loneliness to two <unk> that i always have .
one part of humanity is , is in the beginning of lonely .
one of the birth to the birth is actually just lonely .
there are few moments in life where you can see that .
and these people are often <unk> and drive the whole day .
i do n't have time is that <unk> .
and then people might be less <unk> , which say , everything is connected to all .
and i do n't really do it , so i 'm just one part of the big universe .
and there are the big group that i 've been , and i think that 's so much as well .
so all right , okay , today i 'm lonely and the next day , right , it depends all together .
when we think of loneliness , we 're always thinking about the most big loneliness .
the loneliness of the <unk> , the loneliness of the most <unk> in intensive care .
but over these <unk> , i 'm not going to talk about these large <unk> of <unk> , but i want to talk about the little little <unk> , where loneliness is in such an theater .
i do n't want to talk about burden and <unk> of the <unk> .
loneliness to people does not deny to us , most difficult at us to detect hatred .
the photographer <unk> <unk> did a few photos i want to show you .
how easily we 're going to fall into other loneliness .
and we do n't all know whether these people really felt felt in this moment .
but who does n't know the moment that you know , the moment of that moment , where you 're thinking , you know , you 're all lost in the corner and everybody has n't lost .
all of these <unk> of loneliness is safe here .
maybe some people have experienced today .
what you 're going to do is , you 're looking at the cell phone , but you could look very well , the <unk> of the cell phone on the cell phone .
clearly , if you look at the display .
now , what we do n't do .
yes , and then there 's loneliness that 's sitting in front of you in front of a <unk> on top of the <unk> faces in front of the <unk> faces in front of you , and you ca n't leave something that you ca n't forget .
these are the <unk> that you see from the outside .
we ascribe to other people .
but i 'm sure there are people here in the room , which has always feel the lonely , of course , the whole whole life has spent trying to be trying to <unk> this loneliness .
and there are still in this room for people who are the lonely , because they have to give it for another people or because of a separation .
there 's nothing that does n't use that much people that they are connected to , around them , they 're feeling lonely .
and there are people who have lost their connection to themselves , and that 's why .
i 'm <unk> the digital loneliness .
and sit down to the multi-touch versus <unk> .
the analog versus loneliness is familiar .
these are people who have a <unk> of social contacts .
it 's always relatively <unk> .
there 's no <unk> number , there 's no more <unk> , when someone has enough one .
there 's the old people falling out there .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since that , we all live in cities with a lot of people in facebook or the facebook of twitter or facebook is that digital loneliness is getting bigger .
you can be connected with hundreds of people without being connected with a single person .
is it in the analog , rather than the data of human relations , it 's missing in the digital loneliness .
the two forms of loneliness are very often <unk> .
it 's also that the analog versus loneliness is wrong with a <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness is good for <unk> and your columns in <unk> .
it 's that the digital loneliness is more likely to gain weight in the future , if the opportunities are to connect .
i do n't know if you 're going to be in six years of that sense that 's going to be very similar to the <unk> of loneliness .
or you find a new term .
but this is also the issues of <unk> generation .
almost bigger than loneliness is the fear of loneliness and from this fear of loneliness to do people .
<unk> , the big <unk> , a <unk> person has written a wonderful <unk> <unk> .
you know what people do everything to be alone .
they build cathedrals , the witnesses that are then lonely and alone .
but it 's not named <unk> to <unk> the fear of loneliness , which is money .
<unk> go .
<unk> .
both of the process , both of the difficulty about the loneliness because it 's a complete problem as well as the objects that you have photos .
problem is just going to be very short and makes this <unk> against loneliness .
that 's why we have to do new things again .
i 've seen the advertising for a <unk> panties .
and the most <unk> of the phone is <unk> communication with the identity of it .
what that 's going to do with the panties , you do n't know , but it seems to work .
so loneliness is nothing to do n't do with <unk> , under people .
<unk> <unk> wrote a wonderful poem , and there 's a verse that 's wrong with <unk> .
hand on the heart , who does n't know that ?
in one relationship or the other , or the other part of the <unk> , and suddenly suddenly feel feel guilty , terrible feeling and ask the question that is this human being ?
i have to do something to do at all right ?
a study is saying that on the <unk> women , women are married , married with kids .
this is missing , because i do n't know if i was invented the study , i invented it as often .
but also , in fact , it does n't matter because of research , and the reaction is the same thing that people are looking at .
that means that , of course , it 's like that , almost a <unk> .
so loneliness to <unk> is not the familiar , and yet we do n't talk about them .
talk about the <unk> of loneliness to sex .
and that 's probably what everybody has experienced .
for example , even when you start thinking suddenly , what do i do ?
who is this person in my bed ?
the one form of loneliness that has not have to do what has to do with the quality of sexual <unk> .
nothing has to do with the quality of relationship .
it 's just there .
we do n't talk about them because we do n't look at them .
we 're just not right about them in the workforce .
in the workforce , the loneliness is too <unk> as we think .
i stood up with <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better , three sketch , and two shot .
the two men have taught the two women in <unk> .
and in between , something <unk> , something <unk> in the hand of the <unk> .
so i think , i do n't have to go to you to do this in the scene that you have experienced this form of loneliness in his workforce .
it 's the loneliness of the <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness of the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see there are some of the life of your life <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> , in hotels , in <unk> bars , they do n't know who are actually what they are doing .
where they wake up .
it 's also a form of loneliness , which is not speaking about .
it 's also like <unk> as loneliness as <unk> .
here is <unk> .
i first told me a <unk> is that he was called by a client , and they said it 's what happens very interesting , you ca n't imagine .
a <unk> was in the lunchroom alone .
so he 's got his <unk> .
and two months later , he 's <unk> <unk> .
so the loneliness is never going to be alone .
it 's always connected with others .
she has beautiful siblings , and she has ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings we do .
fear of sadness and the shame of shame .
but we should not forget the beautiful siblings .
freedom the pride is the yearning for the <unk> .
therefore , my plea for <unk> is loneliness .
comes and goes into life like the <unk> and flood .
let 's do it , and let 's do you .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness and that 's the blank , which may be in loneliness when you get nothing more comfortable .
loneliness is part of life .
for me , i 've been thinking about loneliness for loneliness .
for example , in my <unk> , i have n't think of the virgin dictator , i realized that i have to have someone who did n't have a <unk> , because i thought i would have always losing the people , i would have been <unk> .
i 've been able to get that since i 've embraced the loneliness to my life and let me go .
this is exactly the same thing that you do .
i 've become free .
people come and let 's go back to the way that they ca n't blow up immediately , whether it could be a friendship or a friendship .
as a kid , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing .
that ca n't start to start with any <unk> .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
each time , it made me <unk> .
as a child , i thought , embarrassing .
as a young adult , i 've been incredibly incredible to do this openness .
but only i 've been so much to the loneliness that i 'm going to do , at least so far as well as well .
you 're going to be lonely for the next talk .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
i got three pigs .
a <unk> of a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now i 'm going to ask you what the <unk> would be able to take you ?
most of them would decide for the <unk> .
and this is a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we produce the most effort the biggest effect .
in health , we do n't do that different .
there 's what we do with the biggest effect by eight and decide to others .
for example , for example , for example , for the <unk> , for sports .
but big <unk> is great effort .
so for me , not so valuable .
or we decide to the <unk> .
for diet .
but also , big <unk> , still very big effort .
so for me , not so valuable .
and i want to tell you what they 're going to do with the least the biggest effort .
if you get <unk> and health , you ca n't get around the topic .
and the issue is , <unk> .
and the topic is , in germany , it does n't have been a topic in germany .
and then the number of overweight people went into germany .
and i asked what was going on in the <unk> ?
so why was that so nice to the top ?
and i went to research , and i was also <unk> .
because it was in the years of <unk> .
what was there ?
there 's been <unk> .
and we are always bigger and bigger ?
and i went on .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> .
and that 's increased .
and in the years of <unk> , the curve is just going to go on .
and then what happens after germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
and we are always bigger and bigger ?
well , then i got one and a <unk> .
because it was clear .
sports is <unk> .
and of course , i 'm not supposed to tell you here to tell you that sports is <unk> .
because this is not true .
but we have found in common .
the flood of new training -- and <unk> has not led to <unk> and healthier .
so what is it ?
diet ?
and there 's a great study of the states .
that 's the problem with obesity .
and they 've launched in the <unk> <unk> .
and then they wanted to look at what happens there ?
and you have seen , people have always take less fat but people are still less calories , but still <unk> .
and this was paradox .
and therefore , they called the <unk> .
we can explain that ?
there are allowed to be able to imagine the body like a power power .
there is this big <unk> here .
and on the one side is a <unk> , because we do all the pits of the <unk> that burned here .
and here 's the energy of energy <unk> .
but if we 're going to spend more <unk> here in our power , we use the energy in power power and power .
the human body does n't matter .
you can store the energy .
and in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
but what happens when we have less as we have heard of energy , and yet it turns out , and yet it turns out the energy to make it just a conclusion .
the <unk> has increased dramatically .
here 's no life more instead .
we 're just building each other .
and that 's exactly what happens .
our grandparents are still running 20 miles away .
and we 're going to come up with two miles and these are the positive estimate .
there are studies that report on five -- to <unk> feet .
i 'm going to tell you some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
do you have a degree of the chair ?
mike , will you get degrees ?
mike is americans .
he 's shy , he wo n't talk much .
and he was in this trial and sitting here .
he 's the typical <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike kills less and less and less and even more , and still it gets more and warm .
why is that ?
because mike just is still sitting .
and i looked like <unk> mike so much day , and i put him a back back in the pocket of the pocket , and i did it again .
and there was a thousand steps .
this was the distance that mike games has come from the car in the office with the car , of course , of course , of course , coming back in the morning .
and he came to a thousand steps .
this is mike he was 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and <unk> minutes , mike or was mike .
among these conditions , disease is alone .
and mike is not going to become dick , because he 's going to eat too much energy , but it 's not used to energy , but it 's not even more <unk> and the energy
and first , the energy , as you can see here in his <unk> .
but energy is that not there .
the <unk> went back into <unk> blood .
and it 's too active and <unk> and quiet at its <unk> .
so the <unk> .
so if energy <unk> <unk> into the blood , the doctors are <unk> <unk> and high <unk> .
and that <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , like <unk> , power <unk> everywhere in these <unk> .
and a happiness is that the whole <unk> , and that 's literally <unk> , and we 're talking about <unk> or <unk> .
and now , <unk> heart is right under pressure , because now he has to get the blood through these tight <unk> <unk> and we talk about <unk> .
and when this mass <unk> is like a <unk> , it turns out in the body .
and when the hearts happens , we call the heart attack .
and if that 's in the head , we call the stroke .
and in germany , every second is dying of heart attacks and stroke .
that means in germany every second is dying of <unk> .
so mike is not going to be sick because he does n't get a sports , it does n't move more .
and if you do n't know that , you know , you 're looking for the wrong place .
for example , for example .
i still have a chance of <unk> dieting , and there 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
and if each book is just like a shot , and we would <unk> the <unk> <unk> , we would have a 30 yards of <unk> <unk> .
and i read the read for you .
and there is there , and this is really important if you 're going to get more energy more than they 're using them thick .
and if you get less energy than you 're going to use it .
that 's brilliant .
but why do we need books about this ?
and that 's just just a conclusion .
the need is , of course , is huge but <unk> is not help .
because why is a diet <unk> ?
because it 's a diet , and no lifestyle .
what 's doing the things that we 're going to do three weeks , and so five weeks , when we go back after that struggle , back to the normal life , to our ordinary lifestyle .
what 's in five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
except for <unk> and again , again , again , we did n't do what we 've done .
so they 're going to be allowed to be in every new diet , in every new <unk> , and you want to integrate this in your everyday lifestyle .
yes or no ?
and then we go .
and if no , they 're just going to stay .
because at the end of the end , it 's not a little bit more popular time .
they 're the habits of whether we 're going to get sick or stay healthy .
it 's the bad habits that make us sick .
and it 's the good habits that we 're healthy .
and <unk> in the mirror , he 's looking at the end of his everyday lifestyle .
when mike , when mike in the mirror , he 's looking at his daily habits .
and if mike is looking at the mirror , and frankly , it 's also going to see where he 's going on .
because if he 's good habits than good , it 's just in the direction of disease .
and if mike 's listening to the direction of your goals , the direction of his dreams , he does n't have to change his whole life .
then he just need to do more good habits than bad .
and a <unk> sense mike is also a great example of the human animal .
mike has made it for example , and it 's completely <unk> from his day , <unk> through the car , with your car , using each of the elevator .
and in the night , he 's sitting on the couch on the couch , and somehow somehow to come back into motion .
so he 's going to put in his <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , and he 's <unk> , and it 's going to be <unk> , and it 's going to be like this is a <unk> rat again , so he somehow somehow come back to motion .
and my grandpa would have had exactly the same <unk> .
and that was a farmer , and he did n't know that .
you know , sports is not going to move on humans .
and somehow he 's kind of right .
why do we have to deal with the <unk> night , what we 've lost on the day-to-day life ?
basically , we would have to do it with this <unk> lifestyle today , two hours a day .
in fact , it 's much easier to find the motion , where we lost them .
in your day-to-day life .
and that 's why i 'm going to teach them to a change area .
maybe they may have seen the situation , and you even know the way you go back to the night and <unk> that in the first series .
and this is what you 're looking at all of these <unk> into us .
we always want to get the shortest strategy .
we plan our homes that we have the <unk> ways .
we 're going to plan our whole life that we have the <unk> ways that we do n't exist , where we 're going to <unk> .
it 's a different direction .
so that 's why you 're allowed to activate the <unk> , and find the motion again , where it 's on .
for example , i 'm like to get the track of the track .
and i am the only one that always goes up and down and down , and goes down and go down and everybody else .
but i know , i 've got to <unk> the time for me .
i then <unk> the movement that is just like that .
and when the <unk> comes off , 30 minutes , tell me <unk> .
<unk> steps .
that 's about three times the 10 minutes .
and a <unk> <unk> steps , if you 're going to go back to every day , it 's going to be more than 12 grams of fat in your body .
maybe that may sound relatively little .
but as <unk> , as a habit , as a habit of <unk> , <unk> days , we will talk about four point five pounds of fat .
we ca n't have our bodies .
and you give me a degree of this , i always <unk> it .
the americans are crazy , which is what we 're doing here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of <unk> .
i think that is four pounds .
just you see what happens with these little steps .
and when the effect is , of this point of view , what do you start to start when they 're going to start in a active life .
and this <unk> will go through every day in your day-to-day life .
once you get a day after <unk> steps , it 's almost a <unk> of that .
and if you do , and time you have on top of the top .
then you have <unk> next to the <unk> .
then they will go faster and stronger .
but they do n't make your health on the health .
so they do n't keep your health from your <unk> and from your time .
because the most important thing that they do is lifestyle every day .
and i <unk> a active lifestyle .
and for me , it 's more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> for a clear decision for life and for me .
because i think health has not to do what we should do or do .
it 's what we want to do with what we want to do .
and that 's why i 'm just going to be a idea today .
you just want to go on the best one .
and now you know how it goes .
step for one .
thank you very much .
<unk> like this is an leonardo da vinci , <unk> , <unk> way to see the world with other eyes ?
and even so far on the deep , which is just simply <unk> to his time , was unimaginable , amazing ?
can we have this ?
would that have something like the <unk> ?
and how do we draw power and confidence for our future ?
let 's start to start with innovation ?
sure .
technology 's inventions , and development actually actually have the official <unk> of the government has the title of the federal government .
so , you understand me right .
that 's all great .
and we can be proud of this to be proud of this and grateful that we 're going to be <unk> in such a fields that our <unk> are already going to be in the world that it 's good for us .
that 's what we 've created so remarkable , unique wealth .
what about the future ?
what challenges come to us to society ?
and who care about the big ecological and social challenges ?
so it seems to be kind of the end of the end .
a <unk> rule .
so the economy is going to be the ecological challenges , because the entrepreneur then we grow productivity and efficiency .
and the world is better going to do better in nonprofit organizations and <unk> and <unk> , and then what we have to do is , of course , of course , <unk> the damage of thomas economy .
at least , at least <unk> .
but who is that we need to look at all the time as though .
what if we expand our environmental social and cultural environmental dimension ?
when technological innovation are also cultural innovation ?
so if economic innovation are also social innovation ?
so if we were able to think about this <unk> , and they <unk> into the solution , and social challenges ?
if it 's going to make any unknown forces , and if there 's been a whole different , fair <unk> development ?
because this was that ?
both sides wanted to do that , right ?
can we do this ?
you might wonder .
so far , we still have the contradiction .
happiness is encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus did with his <unk> , with his <unk> , in bangladesh , a lot of power to poverty .
and interestingly , it 's also a lot more <unk> to what the state of the state is done .
and he has <unk> <unk> as entrepreneurs who have noticed the nobel prize winner .
the opportunity there is , i think i 'm going to be known as well .
so , allow me to imagine <unk> <unk> .
it 's the subtle guy .
so <unk> , but his ideal <unk> .
and yes , really <unk> .
i like to love that .
and if you see the look , you think , in the offspring , we do n't need to worry about our future .
well , in the class , he started to work somewhere in the one of our <unk> <unk> .
and that 's what he does .
that 's very good , and it 's very successful .
and there 's something like this is so in him .
so he 's not going to ask this one that kind of <unk> me ?
that 's what the main people say he always says .
<unk> are in all the <unk> .
and this is too .
and he 's like this <unk> .
so the right there , there 's the same thing that he recognized the same .
so not that he knows it personally , but it 's like that .
and there 's in the middle of the t that he did n't know .
so the more time he was surprised by the <unk> of the <unk> .
as mister <unk> .
and as a <unk> entrepreneur , he said that .
that 's great joy , so with the young people , the experience brings to me .
and the two people have been found .
and they 've been met .
what if we 're just going to <unk> this talk about the two times ?
so <unk> <unk> , so it was exactly the same thing .
what 's exactly the difference between <unk> <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
i did n't know that .
yeah , so , then we start to start with the question , what is <unk> <unk> ?
so , the name is called it .
permanent markets , permanent products , permanent customers , advanced structures , there are a <unk> .
and you can also <unk> that kind of <unk> , where the big shapes is .
and even more serious , even when the <unk> is really <unk> .
what is a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you know , you know , you 're not going to do it 's not the little copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it 's a completely different character .
because it has nothing intrinsically <unk> .
no <unk> customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing known .
so one of the things that is a temporary organization to seek a business model for the purpose of the purpose , to develop the profitable thing , of course , but it 's <unk> , and then scale .
and you will understand , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course
yes , this is clear .
but what are we looking for ?
so , i mean , i 'm going to go to the end of the way to make money to make money or money , right ?
so i got there , that 's pretty good , which is what i 've found in berlin , would you recommend this ?
this is called <unk> .
how you succeeded in your company , and they 've been <unk> for the <unk> of your life .
wow .
really <unk> ?
because what do you think if you have 30 your <unk> money , what is your <unk> ?
so you get a career as a <unk> device , or what ?
what happens to your commitment , how do i know ?
and also , let 's look at the <unk> .
so the statistics are not going to give you a <unk> perspective , because seven percent of all of them have already been a few years after a lot of financial crisis as well .
money is always the outcome of a successful company and a good <unk> company .
sure , money is a source of <unk> for <unk> .
and it 's the foundation of economic inequality .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i look at what i have learned is , so , without the goal is no way of the right .
and so , you know , goals would have been <unk> to measurable and so forth .
and when i do n't have that , so the way i ca n't look for something that i do n't know ?
so this does n't make me good sense .
so as i want to decide because of the risks , and it feels like <unk> and <unk> .
yes , welcome to the rise of <unk> .
but i was there for you .
a thread .
so that 's already <unk> , so almost <unk> .
successful <unk> from generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so how do you say today ?
<unk> that i think , <unk> ?
so we always say , `` <unk> . ''
in common crises and <unk> and <unk> uncertainty .
so sure .
so i think , i can leave you one of that .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there 's just right there .
so this is the same one of the most important social qualities of being good questions .
can we go out of one after the others that i might get better ?
so the first one is , what am i doing here ?
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> , what happens to you about you , bigger than you ?
what do you do on the world ?
what are people when you work together with you ?
what are you willing to give you ?
what are your internal , maybe not unconscious .
why is that important to recognize ?
because this is also the rise of entrepreneurship .
and how did we learn this ?
if you want to build a boat , they do n't want to collect the men together , and they 're going to collect a hot <unk> of wood , but i teach them to the long , <unk> ocean .
yes , good .
so let me ask me the next question .
what is my <unk> <unk> ?
what does that mean ?
yes , <unk> do you have your goal .
<unk> , in details , but i <unk> the same if you 're going to stay with you , what you do n't want to stay .
do you know the story with the pink elephants ?
that 's a bit .
not ?
<unk> .
so , look at it .
reset it , no pink elephants .
okay ?
does it work ?
so no pink elephants .
that understood ?
it 's no pink elephants .
do you see ?
that 's what we 're going to focus on what we do n't want .
what is the only opportunity ?
there 's a <unk> ?
yes , please .
so <unk> <unk> or perhaps the <unk> on the <unk> .
but stop you .
by the way , what are you thinking about me , right ?
i got one with one .
<unk> , if you 're the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this <unk> surgeon , lord smith .
who ?
at the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> , what <unk> <unk> is to death to death with a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> to the <unk> of you to <unk> me on the time of the time that <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i <unk> my <unk> into the <unk> .
<unk> lady <unk> .
wow , but <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
it 's called a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
and <unk> like this ?
is you what noticed ?
has changed anything ?
okay .
okay , so the flower .
okay .
so , let 's look at the fact where the bear has remained .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this <unk> surgeon , lord smith .
who ?
at the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> , what <unk> <unk> is to death to death with a <unk> .
i had a <unk> of you to <unk> me to the time of the time that the time of the time is that the time of the time <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i <unk> my <unk> into the <unk> .
<unk> lady <unk> .
and <unk> , how does it go ?
so , i know , i was shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i saw the first time .
i thought i could n't be that .
and still a lot more shocked , i would go through the head is that i actually have the whole time over the area ?
through my life .
okay , i 'm going to make it totally sense .
there is the immediate immediate immediate immediate <unk> to prevent that most of our perception and our <unk> first .
but what happens now ?
what am i was and what <unk> am i ?
and therefore , look at the perception of your perception of <unk> , is a lot of important <unk> quality .
well , yes , thank you , then we get to the next question .
how could i get to my goal ?
so , this is a good question .
and i 'm going to think about this , and i do n't even know each time .
yes , <unk> , there 's good news for you .
that 's going to fall easier to you , maybe you may have known as well .
because you know , if you know , your geography is your body , and if you have been a <unk> pilot , i promise you will happen in the inside of ourselves .
it 's automatically automatically .
you 're not going to be different than that a brainstorming is going to happen to you that things on you .
that 's the famous <unk> that you have under the shower at the morning .
and i 'm going to have a lot of question to look at you to look at the point you 're going to look at the place , who you could do , who would be , if you could ask , who you could ask for advice , and i could ask any more data there to get home .
and you have a big model .
the <unk> have great <unk> .
<unk> di <unk> when the <unk> did n't know in florence in florence .
for lunch for lunch .
it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , <unk> , <unk> engineers , architects , and he has a lot of intense <unk> .
but not in our future , where it 's going to go , yes , who put in ?
who has right ?
but in fact , there 's a sudden of these different types of different types of different types of different types of different types of different types of different types of things that are in a way that they could have gotten out of themselves .
well , yes , the next question is what the concrete next thing i do ?
there 's a <unk> entrepreneur in the reason .
instead of design , and management and so forth , and so on the next step .
because what is you doing in the domain of uncertainty ?
but that 's the very determined that 's going to emerge .
and then , if it was nothing well , you know , dan will look at the other thing .
and even if the big , <unk> <unk> is nothing much .
so that 's why your meaning is clear .
that 's the inner security .
and the rest of the way we 've used to do this ?
even though we did n't know that , and no one did n't know ?
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , <unk> kids .
so , this kind of playful learning is this kind of looking for this kind of <unk> and what this <unk> is looking for , it 's a fun thing that 's happening in a business opportunity .
and that 's exactly the same kind of thing that 's <unk> against the uncertainty that otherwise always <unk> us .
yes , thank you .
so that 's pretty good at all .
but i do n't know , i know , in the company , i think that there are a lot of civil rights changes that something happens .
and in fact , in germany , there 's all the common mood .
and i think , because the politicians have to be worried about that .
okay , my boy , come to me .
so how do you go down to water .
what do you think about how many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 ?
10 million ?
look down here .
who you see ?
right .
this is the way you can change that you can really change .
or to say , with mahatma gandhi to say the change that you 're looking for in the world themselves .
do you make beautiful words and big role models , but how do that really work ?
there 's also a silver <unk> couple of <unk> on our <unk> .
useful in all kinds of crisis , or if you feel like this , or when you feel a <unk> , and they all have to do with you .
and if you ask you in these situations , what you 're going to ask you now is , you know , what sharing you can take your posture to feel powerful .
but look at what you like to do is you just <unk> you .
and finally , ask , you know , you know , you know , what you actually actually do from this crisis or what it 's happened to do .
so i mean , if you have happened to you , at least it 's worth it .
well .
mister <unk> .
and do you think that that 's going to help me on my fight ?
exactly .
and see two things .
first of the clarity , on the clarity of your <unk> , then it 's going to become the source of law .
because that 's your perception .
and the second mission is on your inner mindsets .
because you 're looking at the other people to behave .
the future is always going to change our own perception .
<unk> that ?
yes , i think .
thank you , mister <unk> .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what do they think of our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how do we think about this <unk> ?
is that a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
clearly .
so i look at all the <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> .
and that 's what the <unk> really does .
a <unk> of the <unk> ' <unk> .
and no , new <unk> , <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
the <unk> has been on the great famous name .
robert bosch , bosch bosch about <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they all say .
let 's just <unk> this mind .
and who probably knows yes from our <unk> of our history of our time .
you can see , i 'm <unk> .
so maybe it would be <unk> that i study kids and the future , because after all the future .
instead , that 's the view i 'm going to make most of the time .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i had the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for <unk> .
we 're called <unk> <unk> , which is that they can either be able to make the fall of the fall in the custody of the car , or they would have to find a little bit easier to get a workplace .
so why are i going to do about <unk> , so the u.s. failed are made the great mistake ?
our program is not to understand that kind of easy to understand the programs of children .
and frankly , i thought that the <unk> of the last place in the universe is that i would work .
what do you think is the most important factor in the childhood that we work with ?
and we found , it 's very positive role models , often , positive role models .
and if you think about this , why it 's a lot of <unk> and so many <unk> , and so many <unk> , it 's often that the father does n't have no sensible work that he would have in jail for the prison .
and then when a <unk> boy like he wants to make out of his life , it may not look like a different life , because he has no better role .
and he <unk> his father .
i 'm going to show you martin .
martin is <unk> of our program .
his father was an alcoholic , and he made the life to hell .
when he was 12 , his mom has died and his little brother had to go to home .
there he was the <unk> of the big .
he was shy and <unk> , and so the perfect victim .
until the day after the day , his little brother in a soccer game has been <unk> to the bottom of the ground .
there were <unk> at martin , and he went to the enemy and <unk> .
and off the day he was <unk> .
so it went .
and violence is supposed to be on his life exactly like his father .
so what 's the same thing that i 'm going to just described to you ?
after all , after adolescence , many people are unemployed or have <unk> .
they do n't know much different activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then you 're going to fall in prison with people who are just like that , which is exactly the same thing that are not a better role of role models .
what do you think , these people are in common when they sit together in prison ?
most of them is not much good .
and they 're going to get better in the <unk> .
they had to sell drugs on a higher level and plan for custody of the custody of <unk> .
and that leads to <unk> percent .
this is , in germany , everybody 's <unk> criminals .
but then there are people in prison that really would really change .
but these people have been <unk> on the forehead .
and there is <unk> .
and everywhere , where you get , is your first identity .
whether you 're looking for a workplace , whether they 're looking for a apartment , and they want to build new private relations with this identity , with this identity , which is that kind of <unk> .
that 's the problem that we are .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what does the property do you do a lot of <unk> ?
they will be surprised .
they are old skills .
i mean , who has a <unk> idea of <unk> , from <unk> and <unk> .
you know , only in the topic , it has a little bit of <unk> , and it does n't landed in jail .
this is the properties that we want to do for something positive .
we start our program education in prison , in three <unk> .
we get the basics of entrepreneurship and economy .
each of the participants write his own <unk> and everybody takes part of a comprehensive <unk> .
and then we 're going to play with the investment in the custody of the <unk> , with the <unk> of the personal relationships and also a <unk> .
what for <unk> <unk> from our program ?
it 's a big bandwidth , from <unk> to the agency .
we have a <unk> <unk> .
a very big bandwidth , and i 'm going to talk to you to be compassionate .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and his illusion that have been seduced into the trade .
he was always fun to do business .
he 's been arrested for the first time .
and this in prison did n't have an amazing thing .
quite the opposite .
he says it 's prepared for himself his second in time .
and he was convicted of the second time .
it just took a therapy for a therapy and then <unk> .
and there 's what he learned as he can use his <unk> talent for something .
he 's taken in september 13 , then <unk> the agency for <unk> .
the agency is good , and he can now live with it .
he worked very good <unk> .
he 's here today .
who wants to do that .
still , back to martin , from which i had told him .
martin 's been looking for his childhood as a chef , and i ended up in a little <unk> .
and there 's alcohol and drugs that were going to be pretty fast .
he worked with parallel as <unk> and a <unk> .
twenty years , he ran this life .
and he says , today he 's not going to be any existing self-confidence .
one day he injured someone to be so difficult that he was convicted .
he took the most part of the most part of the most <unk> , and the <unk> has changed his life .
he learned how he had more force to more success and more quality of life without effort to consume drugs .
and he was so excited about his knowledge that he decided he had to share this one wants to share it .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
that worked out .
he 's now working on two years for us for two years , and <unk> our participants in the direction , because he knows that if you really want to change me , and if you 're really going to change the right , and if you get the right tools with the hand than you 're often
the basis of these successes are people like them .
people who are coming to the prison with the <unk> , with us to get our participants in their <unk> , to <unk> your personal plans .
these are our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our teaching , who are students to do the <unk> <unk> .
and these are our mentors who are looking at our participants in the bedside .
and these people are taking very much from our program .
one example .
we 're making an exercise that is called <unk> .
we put a big <unk> on the middle of the room , and we 're on the one of the people on the other side .
and i 'm going to ask a different question .
and every time you answered this question with the room , he answered that line .
and here shows what we all have in common whether we sit inside the prison , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of where the difference is , is the question .
i grew up in a called social <unk> , or i had a family school what already was in custody .
there is a lot of our participants in front of the line and just very few of our people .
one thing i like to ask us all of the game that all connects us the <unk> .
so i 'm going to ask you all of all the morning .
maybe we can get a little light in the audience .
i can see them .
it 's all .
that 's amazing .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to answer you a question , and if you 're going to answer this question , you 're just going to stand .
that 's what our line that we 're looking at .
i did in my life of illegal things i could have suffered .
if you 're answering this question , you 're answering this question .
it 's important to be drunk car .
and also , there 's also a small amount of <unk> .
and it does n't matter the driver of the driver 's <unk> .
okay .
and also , it 's also going to have a lot of labor to have the <unk> <unk> .
all right .
most of them .
we have a angels in the room .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you to sit down all the back .
in this question , when we look at the events , our people will come in love .
and many will probably have a lot of happiness .
happiness with parents , happiness with the environment that they were growing up with the friends , but fortunately they are not always being caught in the edge of the edge of the edge of the <unk> or even beyond that .
what are the results of our work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni found from <unk> in <unk> days .
it 's rapidly quick .
<unk> percent have already made one .
a third of the donor are <unk> .
and our <unk> is seven percent .
i 've already told the <unk> of seven percent in germany .
i 'm a <unk> .
a <unk> of energy costs in <unk> per year , <unk> dollars .
and it 's a nice <unk> , <unk> , which is a <unk> of seven percent of <unk> percent of the <unk> percent .
when my father and i started the <unk> , we 've been open to a lot of a lot of a lot of many <unk> .
i ran my great <unk> in a big corporation .
but i have to tell you , i did n't make a <unk> work .
we encourage our participants to take responsibility .
it 's responsibility , which is happening in your life , and all of all is responsible for what 's going to happen in your life .
not hide , nothing to <unk> .
because it leads to a whole new self-confidence , and enables them to build on again .
and therefore it makes me beautiful and proud if our participants report on the way .
so i brought you a little video .
<unk> .
so i became convicted of two years and eight months of dangerous .
i was convicted of <unk> <unk> against three years and 10 months .
i have traded a threat .
so , i have judgment from two years because of dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so through my part of participating in <unk> has actually changed my complete life .
and what was important for me was that the <unk> thing is being made .
because there was my absolute <unk> .
i was not <unk> , <unk> i 'm almost saying yes .
again , i 've got goals back .
i discovered perspective , i 've been looking at the front page .
and you 're going to go with a very different consciousness and self-esteem from the custody of the custody .
so far , it was more <unk> without <unk> goals , and then you 're still going back in anything .
that 's the wrong people together and not anymore .
well , the problem is that many of them have no <unk> than that .
this is the biggest problem , and then it 's automatically <unk> that you get back into the old <unk> .
you do n't know anything else .
through this <unk> of these <unk> cell , no matter , which is going to be offered to me , about me , over the whole way of thinking about me , over the issues that has been <unk> with the society that has been completely <unk> during this guy .
i 've been <unk> by my first woman .
and for about the six months , i 've been living together again with her .
so this means we started a new relationship .
and because i 've also changed under these whole <unk> and many other things .
i 've got a lot of stuff .
i 'm going to start with my identity .
so i 'm going to work in my life today , `` i 'll say . ''
i just put a <unk> on the <unk> .
you have to realize that it 's very , very , very many people in fact , for example , for example , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , i 'm even aware of that time , and actually , i know , i do n't know , <unk>
i 'm grateful for the idea that they do that .
i 'm grateful that they have to have trouble <unk> , and i 'm extremely grateful that i could be part of them .
and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , the whole people that are supporting this .
i 've been talking about a lot of people in the <unk> , and that 's always <unk> that 's good to do .
and that 's why i 'm going to do it .
and i think .
come in jail .
every one of you have something we can need .
whether you 're going to <unk> our participants in their <unk> , whether they 're going to come to whether they are in the frame of a financial support .
whether you want to have our program to a new <unk> , very <unk> .
please .
martin craftsmen and i are here .
and look at the conversation with you .
thank you very much .
<unk> , i have <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> in nepal .
in a time i was a <unk> .
you do things like this .
for <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> .
one sabbatical in the <unk> .
there are really many opportunities to do with <unk> .
you can do things like that .
anyway , i was <unk> <unk> .
with my work and so <unk> with the <unk> .
so i really have to talk about <unk> .
and not the real problem .
my problem i was <unk> , and i was right exactly what my life would be in 10 minutes , 30 years .
it was <unk> .
and this <unk> is frightening .
for the <unk> .
basically , i had a <unk> crisis crisis .
<unk> like private .
i just did n't know to go on the <unk> path ?
just make me comfortable ?
or what if i get back to the <unk> again ?
and look what happens .
and then what waiting for me .
that 's the thought .
i was free with free <unk> in this time .
like <unk> .
the tracker was essential to me in the most <unk> of absolute life .
you 're going to <unk> the world for free to the world , and they put the country in a very <unk> way .
but by <unk> , also very <unk> countries .
developing developing countries where there 's no more likely to see and say to be more than <unk> villages with nice villages with nice local people , even though they have nothing <unk> and joy .
and this is exactly the same one of these images and <unk> lives , but also a <unk> <unk> .
and that was exactly for me for a while for me .
i was what i did .
<unk> .
and also , i found a little <unk> from me to write about a country that i do n't really know .
that 's what i wanted to change .
i wanted to understand countries .
to write to <unk> articles .
and to breastfeeding my personal interest .
how do you know countries know ?
you can live with people .
people live on their homes .
not in the hotel .
so with the challenges and with the issues of people .
and by making people work .
at least , the answer i could give me on this question .
and i wanted to do that .
also , i wanted to make something wrong .
i wanted to make a contribution .
something good .
and this feeling has been even more <unk> .
i was in the world in the developing world , but nepal has been very touched by nepal .
there was a <unk> civil war there were not only more orphans , but many economic issues left behind .
with a year , with a annual average of <unk> annual revenue is nepal in south asia .
and importantly , to one of the two poorest countries of the world .
one quarter of the population lives below the poverty line .
nearly one fifth of the population has suffers from malnutrition .
forty percent of the adults can not read and write .
all of these facts connected to lots of personal stories and stuff that i met on this journey in a time i was ready and open for change .
and i wanted to do something about myself .
and for me , after my return of nepal .
i quit my job .
and <unk> for aid .
and i 'm going to go on a little bit of the answer that i got to do on my job .
because she was just a <unk> .
it 's about a serious application for <unk> international enterprise .
and not about a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> , the wait for <unk> in nepal , and to look at a funding .
hi ?
go ?
my job was really serious and good .
at least , i thought .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really <unk> .
and of course , there was pretty emotional response .
and fortunately , <unk> .
instead , i was quite a particularly intense sense of making what good <unk> are .
i 've used it as a motor to do my own business .
<unk> .
heart <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
a company that is basically what i 've been looking for .
that 's the possibility to continue a country different .
the possibility to know is a country right .
by the way i can live with people and work .
it can not work anywhere , but in listening .
in the way , you can use them to two words .
so karma and <unk> .
this is what the place that you can collect good <unk> .
you can do good .
this sounds pretty much more <unk> .
but is n't it .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development .
at least , we use a <unk> tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and tourism .
because the people who travel through their <unk> ,
they pay for your journey , like in another <unk> .
but they just travel differently .
they live with <unk> .
and the principle is not going to be much <unk> or even much more <unk> .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
so our participants are ever involved in the <unk> and interests in different projects .
we can have a <unk> of tourism in regions of areas that would not have a chance of <unk> <unk> .
because just the infrastructure is missing .
for instance , we can promote sustainable projects .
we can capture sustainable projects and finance .
so we 're targeted for a hundred percent itself .
they rely on donations .
and this is just the long time for our freedom of meaning of meaning .
starting with our work in nepal .
we have our engagement on uganda .
and now after four years , i 've got to get married and my husband , and i have a <unk> question .
let 's go on the <unk> ?
or what if we think bigger ?
now , when we do it even further .
if we do n't have social engagement and sustainable travel , and development in its character ?
and the individual <unk> .
or some particular individual <unk> .
that would basically a new tool .
a company that focuses on businesses .
but the same philosophy of the world 's philosophy like <unk> .
do we want to do that ?
was the next question .
<unk> new businesses ?
let 's do that .
we love entrepreneurs and their creative businesses .
because we 're going to <unk> <unk> .
because we talk the same language .
because we dream the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and that 's why we have a sister for this year .
<unk> .
and with <unk> <unk> , we <unk> creative companies in their development and <unk> that we need to support with very sophisticated people .
now , with the participants , we have the participants , entrepreneurs or employees from creative companies with individual development .
so the personal social and <unk> is <unk> .
and they were preparing for the <unk> .
<unk> again .
it 's a commitment to a meaningful <unk> of a meaningful number of energy .
he 's looking at a moment of a short time , or where you 're <unk> .
where you may have more profound prejudice .
where you may have to be <unk> flexibly to think about it .
and he shows what you 're doing right .
<unk> his strengths .
it 's the creativity that suddenly is great .
or is it the luxury of being discovered .
the <unk> things you ca n't change .
and the force to change things that you can change .
and you can change very much .
already , in very short time .
we know that .
one example .
these are <unk> rose <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
this is five of the <unk> women from uganda .
<unk> , and with talent .
they <unk> beautiful , <unk> <unk> for years .
and it did n't have happened for years .
because they did n't have the market for that .
because they did n't know how they can improve the quality .
because nobody told me what design may be asked .
we wanted to help these women .
and that 's why in this year , a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products out of poverty .
they give you a income .
one future .
we went back to our <unk> live .
and we start the first <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> of thousands of dna of our women .
<unk> is not just a year .
but enables us to make a lot bigger .
this first <unk> is social <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who wants to support the car for a chain , for the other , but he can go to us to the project .
he can travel to women and travel into action .
in the long , we do n't want to do five women 's work , or a hundred and a hundred .
and not only in uganda , but in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we 're working on .
but this is that <unk> is just a project of our integrated cycle of projects .
we work in all the central scales .
in the area of <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work is in just a domain is just too little .
what happens to kids when the women work ?
right .
so in nepal , we created in nepal and in uganda <unk> two <unk> centre .
everything goes into our cycle .
and the whole power is more sense of that every year .
participants in the different projects in the different projects .
and all the opportunities are always going to be in the common work .
and finally , i just want to take you on a journey .
and to conclude to close the eyes .
reset you in africa .
the rural heart of uganda .
you 're on a wooden dining room table .
and they are satisfied and <unk> .
you just have eaten with your <unk> lunch .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
this is a pleasant warm .
you 're <unk> the window .
and look at the <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand .
you <unk> your <unk> .
they have a thin layer of <unk> .
the children laugh .
and <unk> , for fun .
you 're not going to call you <unk> anymore .
<unk> .
you do n't know how late it is .
but if you 're going to stand up .
and the <unk> , they were just getting the children , <unk> .
at the end of the street is a big tree .
here you 're going to meet you with <unk> .
in the meadow of the forest , you get the new designs to talk about your <unk> .
how do you talk about your hands and feet .
later , the other women come from .
they smile you <unk> .
you have your english language of english .
under the tree .
open .
incredible that there is the internet here .
tomorrow 's kick with your coach .
you know .
the exchange is valuable .
and it 's also nice to speak again .
you <unk> music .
and the <unk> of <unk> .
mom 's `` <unk> '' in the courtyard , <unk> <unk> .
she sings a african song .
you 're relaxed and happy .
you can do the eyes .
each one of us can give us the <unk> into something new .
or at least for a quick time , the cube back to <unk> .
and look at what happens .
thank you .
before i 'm going to be interested in whether you 're the night that you 're going to be here already , somebody had <unk> the house .
i ca n't look at the light right now , but maybe somebody wants to be your hands .
here 's the <unk> ' <unk> .
two .
now , i mean , the <unk> , i do n't know , but it 's two , two , that 's beautiful , we 're already <unk> .
because i got a building , and the <unk> mountain in the east of the city .
that 's the building .
together , with 20 people , i 've been working on the <unk> last summer of six months .
and that 's why i 'm going to <unk> tonight here tonight .
well , well , maybe some of you may say .
what is it ?
<unk> are many .
but i want to explain it short .
well , what is the working on the <unk> ?
and then they <unk> in the park or like ?
just one small selection of questions that we know , my friends , colleagues have been asked when they experience that i 'm part of a initiative to tell you , something <unk> .
and all the expected of the time we had a <unk> into the series of <unk> <unk> .
and here 's about these <unk> <unk> , <unk> motivated and <unk> .
and in the privatization of these <unk> .
but who knows that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was not the elected <unk> of the initiative .
what we see here is a sign of <unk> in <unk> .
this is a public space that is just private , and therefore for a lot of people , i ca n't say , but it 's not in public hand , and just ca n't be used for public spaces .
we were a group of <unk> <unk> into the desire with <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and sustainable <unk> .
and we wanted to tell another <unk> .
we were a <unk> team , and i have to see a little bit , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , urban social -- and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , design , music , photography , <unk> and <unk> .
of course , with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our hopes and <unk> .
and we have to give us different skills but also on various networks .
and a creative part of the things that we 've done is that we 've done to realize <unk> .
we actually have to <unk> the <unk> .
but it went to us that we occupy the <unk> with stories and ideas .
we got to ask memory and images .
and from these memories and images try to develop possible perspectives of the <unk> .
and it 's really important to us that the process is getting <unk> .
we 've always known as a <unk> platform as a <unk> tool .
so the <unk> was a <unk> and emotional and after a <unk> .
in the experience that we have made , i 'm going to talk about tonight .
each city has <unk> places .
there 's a face a face .
and in many cases , these are <unk> and <unk> and become the result of the citizens as <unk> places .
they 're the dead places of a city because they do n't think of the way that we expect in a public space .
for example , we have <unk> <unk> .
and they 're going to get this , but actually the actually public role , neglected the urban places , it 's often <unk> .
initiatives , these are being able to revive these places , often often interest in its infancy .
what has to do with me , like some questions like me , some out of questions like me .
i mean , a lot .
these places are not only one face of our city .
no .
they are social places of our city , where our <unk> life is happening .
so , we 're going to have a lot of these <unk> ties to our neighbors , when we get to the path to the way .
and can this dive , if we just have a serious opportunity , and actually , in fact , when the spaces are designed .
and we just have more food <unk> .
that 's a form of connection , sometimes .
but with security , is a sense of community .
the more part i 'm going to have in such a public space , the faster and the more of this community .
and if i 'm not <unk> , this is what you might call the anonymity of a big city .
we got two challenges ago .
we can become aware of the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and commitment to their neighborhood , or in the <unk> <unk> .
how can it be transformed into creation ?
how can that be transformed into ideas ?
the privatization of the privatization and <unk> of these <unk> places and criticism against the increase , and actually not quite easily <unk> the same places .
now , imagine you 're sitting here , once you beat the newspaper and read next text .
love <unk> and citizens , we 're using them a <unk> , we want to give them three possible <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> , which has been designed for a little <unk> .
you 're allowed to pick up the idea of the idea .
and the stress is that most <unk> is <unk> .
would you go ?
would anybody from you to this event ?
not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds great .
there 's an opportunity to do what 's <unk> .
they are allowed to <unk> the way that this looks like this .
and as i said , sounds great for the first moment .
and i try to give me a explanation .
and in fact , because i think you ca n't really have a really connection or form or participating , <unk> .
first because classical <unk> often <unk> too late .
that means , they do n't have any opportunity to make a little bit of ideas or fundamental alternatives , but there 's been a lot of design , and they are already able to decide whether they 're <unk> or <unk> in the urban green space .
or , like a friend recently , what color is the trash of the trash .
second explanation <unk> <unk> is rarely beyond information and voting .
think about three <unk> <unk> .
we have what we want to show you , and you 're allowed to vote .
frustration and <unk> are often the consequences that i kind of somehow find .
anyway , i do n't want to make a decision about <unk> or <unk> if i had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but it 's also different .
despite the fact that the <unk> of the world 's <unk> have been going to experience a lot of talk , we ended up a lot of <unk> .
we made this experiences and i want to share with other <unk> .
i want to share it to another <unk> , in other projects , but it 's also about the city of the city , and the politics .
because of the ones that are the ones who should be in the <unk> and actually are responsible for these things .
so if you 're really interested in a participation , it 's really <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and then we need to have new <unk> .
not at the end of the <unk> i 'm all the way that you 're sitting in .
and that 's why i think , because i think <unk> is very important .
i 'm going to do that you all go to all , and i want to encourage you to give you an example of our example , to give you an opportunity .
and i connect to you because they are the ones who are the ones that can be a new <unk> <unk> .
so we have to look at the devotion to look at the citizens of mind , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and <unk> , <unk> ?
first , for example , commitment to <unk> .
in <unk> , <unk> , citizens on <unk> and different interests .
what we see here is a reconciliation that we invited .
what we see here are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation .
the goal has to be that all these conversations are on <unk> , so that is not the <unk> of interest , or the <unk> skills of the citizens of the citizens .
the citizens in front of the place is experts , they are experts for their neighborhood , which is missing what they 're going to connect with a place , which is the tradition of what 's missing .
the <unk> delta , especially in the city , we can do that to the project to the project .
in the case , in a particular case , you can be able to add other <unk> of those things that are based on the project that 's species-specific .
this is all going to do a <unk> , in which all the information is accessible to all that can be able to be the place .
so by the way that some of the catadores can be able to get a identification of the place .
a dialogue is also saying that the wishes of the people are actually taken seriously seriously .
and then if somebody says , i want to be a <unk> next to the market .
of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , <unk> are <unk> , but the goal has to be in <unk> , which is the right solution , which is also the right solution and perhaps in the <unk> , but maybe at a different place .
like that , that has to get out of the <unk> .
second point is a lot of different <unk> .
our <unk> is colorful .
one feels like that , if he 's going to be totally <unk> , <unk> group .
another one can be able to write good , but they do n't talk to the text .
you might find another kind of paper .
or create his ideas in <unk> <unk> .
what i want to say is to be different to different <unk> people .
for example , we have the opportunity to get that way , to look at what happens .
in the background , small exhibition .
we have the opportunity to give you the opportunity .
we had the opportunity to paint paint .
we had the opportunity to write .
regardless of the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had the opportunity to connect ideas to play ideas .
also , the possibility of <unk> <unk> , should be empowered .
for example , this can happen to a <unk> that can happen over <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> and transparent availability of results <unk> the dialogue under the <unk> .
in fact , we are diagnosed with the whole process of facebook , and on the one of them , independent blog , and it 's positive <unk> over a <unk> <unk> .
our third thing is <unk> .
you may remember thinking that the <unk> often was often late at the time .
in my <unk> event , there were <unk> <unk> .
now , the process is that the process is , and then it 's going to be early in the best of the best of your own self , what 's going to happen to <unk> area .
and when i have the dialogue , and i 'm going to get a point of one , which will come in a place for a place .
<unk> is also the <unk> itself .
and then , when does n't look at the beginning of the beginning , the <unk> of the time is so looking like this , but it 's kind of looked at the previous previous previous previous experience .
what happens now , if citizens of your city is <unk> and their city .
i 've already see in many projects .
i have an example from <unk> , which is probably known for many times .
in new york , just launched a project , there 's a <unk> project .
in <unk> <unk> , in six weeks , there are six dollars together that are allowed to do or at least <unk> .
now , the time has n't written in august , not unlike the idea of doing that .
the <unk> in new york in new york , i think i believe that i do n't have to say more because he has become the most important <unk> of the city , or <unk> .
in the contrary , the <unk> of the <unk> , there were already <unk> .
in <unk> , we have back back into germany , the citizens already have been able to get <unk> plans to a range of water .
the city was told to do n't need to do .
the four weeks of <unk> that we have for <unk> <unk> that are completely <unk> .
today 's the <unk> of the city .
during the side of vitamin d , it 's wonderful and the city of the city , the initiative that support the initiative , and it was backed by others .
in fact , in the other <unk> of your own <unk> on the street .
in rotterdam , a <unk> involved in rotterdam .
all right , so far , you want to say .
and then we just do so on .
but i think it 's good to make the city from responsibility .
why is that ?
one is because they should have a look at all .
during the <unk> , it 's the country , or companies to concentrate in a form of information in their form of information , the city is the responsibility for projects that are in the edge of the attention .
and also , of course , as the city of the projects , you have the projects , they have the same tool .
in fact , a <unk> initiative can be able to fill this one .
and our goal was , by the way , a temporary initiative , by the way , a temporary initiative , about a half a year , about half a year , the results and the results wanted to get to the city .
the current state was a <unk> <unk> in january .
it 's still a lot of negotiation .
and so sadly , we have the problem that we could n't make responsibility .
but we know , in any case , if the city has succeeded , when the negotiations are actually successful , that then a <unk> will happen .
in which form of life is even open .
to conclude , i 'm really convinced that a lot of projects that have been involved in their meaning , complexity or the cost of the city , have to be a chance you have to have a chance of satisfaction to produce happiness .
and if you 're just going to be in time with the citizens .
in a city and citizens .
and in the city and everybody that you 're sitting here tonight .
if we demand our leaders , and at the same time , the <unk> of the decision-making markets are not more than an <unk> , but as a <unk> .
that 's it .
yesterday , yesterday , we were in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and they came into the <unk> .
we talked about <unk> .
so this idea , even more recent opportunity to have , if it did n't work out in this life , it 's just so much second opportunity .
and we found pretty exciting .
and we were relatively quick that there are two things that we did n't want to experience .
this one is puberty .
the second thing was in the table even in the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you might remember even more <unk> of them .
so , in me , it 's now like this is the <unk> years ago , but the words are immediately instantly to me <unk> hands .
my neck <unk> together , and i just want to get back to it .
and i do n't know how it was to you , but i was the <unk> of the <unk> seriously , who was sitting next to me .
no idea what 's actually becoming .
you will understand it , my school , i was not beautiful , and after i had my last <unk> <unk> behind me , i was completely clear , never again .
and what i 'm going to say , if i go back on the year after the year , i spent some of the most beautiful days that i spent , i spent in schools .
and with big desire and completely <unk> .
how did it be ?
how could this happen ?
so the starting point is that something happens to do what i could do at all .
i got children .
so my wife got the children .
and that 's why they 've been the one that was to take these <unk> .
until the one day when she said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and you 're going to leave you today .
yes , <unk> .
and i opened the door , and i was sitting in this <unk> and <unk> , and i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
this is exactly what i looked like this was at the time .
and the <unk> is also like school , and i commit to me , human being changed .
and when i heard the teacher , you know , the children are not learning for school , but for it , for my life , i believe , `` oh my god , the sentence i did n't have been <unk> .
what is what we get from school , from this conflict , in fact , actually , in life ?
so many of us have learned pretty well .
what are you going to <unk> in your life , right ?
and maybe some people might know how the capital was written by the yugoslavia .
what is the rest of yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity in a very short opportunity is that i 'm going to do a lot of time , just that i can turn it on a button and get bad for me ?
well , i mean , i 'd have used to do it , but otherwise ?
and what says a <unk> of one point is a good doctor ?
whether it 's the <unk> , and whether it has the good <unk> properties ?
no way .
so , no way of life , not for school , we learn .
so if we look like this , like , about <unk> years , in the middle of the <unk> century , there 's what i 've done .
this is time in germany , and that 's the <unk> of the time that 's been <unk> .
and the school system , as we have it has the roots today .
and if we imagine time , it was actually that people did n't have access to the knowledge of your time .
and there were four or six years that they were being used to go in the school and with knowledge <unk> that had the only opportunity to get knowledge and the facts and the facts of their time .
today 's an <unk> more information in his pocket than the biggest library of time .
and the middle of the <unk> century , that was the <unk> of the <unk> .
that means some kind of changes in the world and there 's all people have need to help these new machines .
but at the same time , they need to have people who could wait and repair these machines .
and we needed people who could build these machines and put these factories .
maybe you can see it .
the <unk> school system that we have in germany now has its root in this time .
and it turns out there .
also , because it 's probably the way that i 've learned to work in the school for the assembly line , who stood on the assembly line , who stood for life .
let 's look at the future .
let 's look at the <unk> century where it 's , and look at the year .
the year was the year there was the first <unk> at <unk> .
and i was done with my school , and i thought , now , right now , you 're going to be on the first company .
yes , after some about the internet , i think , `` i 'm going to <unk> , '' and i 'm going to <unk> it .
and some companies are <unk> and getting bigger and bigger , and we are so beautiful , and some of the companies are used to us in the free case .
you look at two times in life .
and we had 30 years after a few years .
so , we had a nice growth , and we had so exciting experienced <unk> like <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know if you have concrete idea what these people do , but when i went to school , we did n't have the idea that it would be .
even when i did n't do anything like the internet .
and the children that we 're going to send in school that we 're going to do in 10 , fifteen , twenty , twenty years ?
the only honest answer is we do n't know .
what know what facts will need to be successful in these future jobs ?
and if you 're honest , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're in the future , in the future , i could give me the <unk> for me .
there are <unk> <unk> i read .
well , you have no idea .
how do we get back to life for life ?
what are the things we need to make children fit for life ?
and maybe a look at what companies are looking for employees .
that 's the <unk> of school , yes ?
the alumni of schools and universities are coming into the company .
and when you look like this , if you look like this , you look at an idea of classic <unk> , it 's first what the expertise .
so that 's what we want to do that , so the read , we 're looking for <unk> , we 're looking for 10 years of <unk> and 10 years , and they are 12 years abroad .
this is not going to stay in the future .
but maybe what schools could be , is the things that are always the important thing that are called <unk> <unk> , and i 'm sure that these <unk> will be the <unk> <unk> .
and you can summarize in the principle in three groups .
this is to a , company , employees , who are flexible flexibly , so that 's a one .
then almost all the companies are thinking about <unk> employees .
and then these companies are <unk> .
so we have <unk> <unk> thinking and <unk> .
let 's start with metabolic flexibility .
that 's relatively quick .
and if we look at the economy , what economy works , how quickly it changes .
<unk> , all the models are displayed on the internet on the head on the head .
there 's my employees that can do with this change .
there is my collaborator that are creative .
there is people who are <unk> .
that 's pretty the opposite of the <unk> in the factory of the <unk> of employees to the assembly line .
the second topic that the entrepreneurial topic is going to be relatively clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's about people who are taking responsibility .
first , for example , your own life .
but also for the big whole .
whether the company is , or as a society , we want people to take responsibility for the big .
and the third factor that <unk> , which is going to be most <unk> .
and when we remember the football <unk> , then there was this beautiful <unk> .
argentina have <unk> <unk> <unk> and germany has a team .
it was not bitter <unk> who won the <unk> .
that could create the same thing .
and somebody , that big innovator of our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was n't the one that invented the iphone , who invented the iphone , invented the <unk> , which does n't invented itunes .
and this was a team that has done because just the team that they could do that .
so for school , the three things that could convey three things that is about the day we 're learning for life .
but there 's another fourth point , and that 's almost more important .
and this is that learning .
if the only thing we can say about the future of the future is that they 're not capable of uncertain , and that 's the ability to learn new and fun to experience this learning of life that we 're going to be successful in the future life
and that 's about the school that is causing these things .
but where was i ?
i sat in this <unk> , and the children who have the children who know that this is not a <unk> event that you need to pay for .
this is the idea of time for the motto , but it does n't say anything about each one .
to point where the <unk> , because all of all the time they all get .
yes , i sat down , and what i 'm going to say , the <unk> of one of my children were still the funniest parts of the event .
less fun was it for me as a father when the stress is about <unk> and learning the whole family life .
even less fun is when the child is getting sick because in the school <unk> .
and finally , this <unk> or was a peak of that <unk> in this school .
it was n't a <unk> , it was like a <unk> , so far after the last hour , and in fact , we were the only parents who were invited .
and i 'm going to <unk> you , and the details of the time , we have to do our child , which is not going to do that .
but two years , but two years , where we have found out there , something that does n't work .
what do we do wrong ?
and we actually had the question is our child broken ?
and are we the only ones that is that ?
now , i 've been talking to the last two years since i 've been talking to the subject of many people , and noticed i 've been able to have you 're not alone .
there 's a lot of that , which is pretty similar , and that was two years ago , because i was just <unk> with <unk> <unk> , a new business , have been thinking about the journey where the journey goes , and in the night , we sat on the bar , and we sat on the bar on the bar , we sat on the bar , and we sat on the bar about private things .
and what i want to say , he 's almost the same story to tell me with one of his kids , he has almost experienced the same thing as we , and we had the happiness that we could have our kids out of school , yes ?
in berlin , there 's a little <unk> of different schools and we could even keep now private schools .
but can everybody out there ?
somehow , it was too little , just our children in safety , and this <unk> out there to let it be .
and after the impression that has been the impression for us since we have changed because we did n't change the right thing , well , we 're the first thing that 's going to do now .
only , how do we change as a <unk> system ?
the good news is that we deceived .
we are not alone .
but we 've found quite a lot of a series of great people who wanted to do what we wanted to do , which is a lot of school that will be .
it 's not that just the kids and their parents under the suffering , which happens to happen in the way .
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
when we look at the number of the world 's revenue , that has changed over the last 10 years .
now , can it be all parents going wrong wrong ?
that all the children are broken , and that teachers are broken ?
or can it be that we have a school system that does n't fit so much more than this <unk> , which is just not going to be right .
and we found a lot of people that went similar , and we found people who do n't have kids .
and they understood that they need to take responsibility for the future that they have to take responsibility for the future , by what we 're going to take our kids and the kids who are going to move on the way .
and we have the whole series of second second , there 's a whole series of great initiatives , and they want to change school , and there are <unk> schools , and there are really great <unk> , and there are almost all of teachers who are really focused and really changed .
and there 's even a kind of bold principal , which is also <unk> to the first step .
and how should we help a <unk> ?
we did n't have a concept that we could now have to help us .
but we can do a thing , we can go into these schools and we can go to these schools the school , and the parents , the teachers , and the students , and we can move into two days .
so there are people who have been working in the past more than each other , and learning to two days , what it means to work .
and that 's where the whole special challenge is very little challenge to solve them together .
and after two , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , this is a new <unk> , or given the <unk> for a <unk> high school at a <unk> school at a berlin school .
or they have concrete for <unk> issues that they have developed in their school .
within two days , around two days , the next day you can get in the next day .
but the most important thing is what happens to this two days , and that 's the power that i have so nice to me so beautiful that i had to spend schools in very early days , this energy that happens when the three things are going to learn
and if the three things are in common , which is what <unk> <unk> .
so just like <unk> thinking , when they experience a team .
then this is such a piece that <unk> .
and if we go back to the same time , and we 're going to come back to the <unk> school as a whole starting to change that there is perfect new culture .
and this is incredibly <unk> .
and i 'm going to be a state of thinking about school .
i 'm supposed to say , for example , you 're supposed to think about school .
and i 'm in front of the class , too , about school , talking about school .
talk about what you like , but they do n't like that .
they will be surprised how much <unk> you have , and how many people have experienced the same thing , but just do n't just talk about it .
let 's bring us every single school in germany .
let 's change the whole education system .
and let 's do this together with the school for a day for day , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because we just can do this .
thank you .
