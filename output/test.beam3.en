when steve lopez , funny times , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , one day , a day , a day of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , homeless , who had just lived on a violin who had two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because of <unk> article about it was a book , again , that 's a book , that 's a book that was <unk> , with robert <unk> , and jamie <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and that 's the fundamental career of a <unk> career in his <unk> schizophrenia .
<unk> left , hospital was <unk> , and 30 years later , he lived as a <unk> in the streets of <unk> <unk> in los angeles .
i recommend you to read all the book , to read , or to read about the film , not just understand the great bond , which is between these two men , but also , like the music that was going to make the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that 's the instrument that was allowed to get the <unk> , <unk> way to get the <unk> .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the <unk> disney hall .
he had a map of <unk> and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking in a very <unk> and <unk> clay , and hillary clinton , and in the way the dodgers would never make it in the baseball world , and that 's all of the first part of the first part of the first part of the first part of the first part of the first part of the first part of the <unk> <unk> fourth program .
and we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got a email in the state , which is that <unk> was interested in me .
i need to mention saying that <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it was already treated with <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been <unk> him .
and as a result , he 's now about these <unk> <unk> , and they 're all so bad , and he 's going to be in the streets of the streets of the streets of <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in exactly a <unk> , <unk> , when we started with the first grade in walt disney grade , and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and seemed completely lost .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and it was going to poison him in the sleep .
i had scared , not the way , but i had scared that i could lose it into a particular note , and that i could be able to destroy his relationship to <unk> and talk about <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk>
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , in <unk> eyes , a <unk> change in <unk> .
it was as though he stood under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose thought was a catalyst .
<unk> <unk> shaped in understanding in a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracle took his violin , and he started to play some clips of <unk> <unk> , and i asked me to play her , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , started from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he did n't only have a <unk> of knowledge of music , but it was also a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding of what i was just about my colleague from los angeles .
by making music , and over music , from this <unk> , confused man , who was <unk> by the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> musicians , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for <unk> , music is <unk> health .
because the music allows him to him , his thoughts and valleys with his imagination , and creativity in something that are real balanced .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that this is the natural creature of art .
and this is the reason why we make music : so that 's something that we have in all , deep , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity .
and the reality of the expression is that we 've got all of us all , and it 's going to be inspired and create us .
what <unk> <unk> , so the music took back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music took him back in a family of musicians , who understood him , and he found it back .
and i 'm going to get back with <unk> music , whether it 's wrong , whether it 's not related to the walt disney hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i grew up musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that 's stolen the <unk> .
i hope you express me .
so i 've known a lot of fish .
i just loved two .
the first , this was more like a passionate style .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , a book on the ground .
what 's a fish .
it 's better , he was in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> level of sustainability .
so you could be able to get it to sell him .
i had a relationship with a whole whole months .
one day , who called the boss of the company , and asked whether i could have an event with a event of the sustainability .
and of course , i said .
so here 's a company to solve what this incredible problem has become a chefs . how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans like we have <unk> the forests .
it 's hard to <unk> the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , who we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , it 's collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so , perhaps or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments . <unk> <unk> pollute the environment , most of you , most of them , and they 're inefficient , we have these images . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 .
that 's called 15 pounds of <unk> <unk> to get a pound .
not very sustainable .
it 's not very good .
so finally , finally a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to support them .
in the day of the event , i called the boss of the boss for the company .
let 's call him the hell .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right , you 're famous in order to grow in the ocean that you do n't have a little bit . ''
`` this is true . '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste of the fish is going to be concentrated . ''
and then he added , `` we 're essentially a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
one thing to be great .
`` <unk> to what ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . put on .
and in this evening , i was in bed and thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so , i called the next day , just for the event , it says ,
i said , `` well , what 's sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he did n't know that . he 's going to be <unk> .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a boatload answer , until i finally <unk> with the <unk> biologists .
let 's call it , `` well . ''
`` frank , '' i said , `` for example , are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , `` well , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much percent of your own business is chicken ? ''
in the assumption of two percent .
`` well , this is about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what is sustainable to feed chicken ? ''
there was a long pause in the leadership and he said , `` well , there 's too much chicken on the world . ''
i 'm betting me from this fish .
no , not because i am a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that 's me .
no , i 've got <unk> in this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after this entertainment after chicken .
this second fish , that 's another kind of <unk> .
it 's romantic kind of romantic , which you are , you know , the better you find your fish , you know , you love the fish .
i would have eaten it in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish for a fish .
she was in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so good , after <unk> ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
call him miguel <unk> . in fact , he 's <unk> .
and no , he did n't have a <unk> , and he 's not a chef . at least in the way that they do , and i understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner , right ?
she 's near the <unk> river .
until the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're in the <unk> , which is basically wetlands .
they were doing that by the country .
they built these complicated <unk> of mating , and they were abandoned water out of the country , and beyond the river .
well , they could n't make sure that was n't , not economically economically .
and green was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds in the birds , which is a lot of birds .
and there 's a spanish company in green company to be the country .
what did you do ?
they have the river of water .
they literally have <unk> <unk> .
instead of <unk> the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water .
they <unk> the channels .
and she created a 11,000 acres of acres -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> , <unk> , and his company completely <unk> the environmental destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything .
you just stare at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is <unk> channels and these dense , voluptuous , voluptuous .
i was there in a long time ago with miguel .
he 's an incredible fellow , three parts of charles darwin and a part of the <unk> .
okay ? so we were and fought in the wetlands , and i was <unk> and <unk> , and we 've got a little bit to my knee , and miguel is a <unk> .
and here he takes a rare <unk> landfill .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , there 's a pattern of <unk> that reminds him in the <unk> <unk> .
it turns out that miguel the largest part of his career spent in africa national park .
i asked him how he became a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i do nothing about fish .
i am a expert for relationships . ''
and then , he 's going to go and fall in more <unk> birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and you do n't understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of fish i had in the <unk> .
so , i was interrupted it . i said , `` miguel , how does it get your fish so good ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , phytoplankton , which is incredible .
but what are your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he 's going to continue to tell me that it 's such a <unk> system that the fish would eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , which is it , which is the fish stick .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there is no food .
most of a farm is , who does n't get your animals ?
later , i was going on in this site of <unk> , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , of course , '' which seems like , like any farm , which i 've ever been , `` how to be success ? ''
in the moment , it was a <unk> , too .
and we <unk> the corner and we had a lot of the most of the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of thousands , a literally <unk> <unk> .
`` this is success , '' he said .
`` look at your <unk> , pink .
she <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> you do n't your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> in birds .
now , last year , these <unk> birds were 18 than 250 different ways .
it 's the largest and one of the most important private <unk> <unk> in all europe .
and i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> , not the last one that you want to have on a <unk> ? ''
he saved his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> , not heavy .
this is a <unk> network .
they 're eating the shrimp .
the shrimp are eating phytoplankton .
so the <unk> , the belly is the way the system . ''
okay , let 's change the mental . one farm , which is not <unk> your animals and a farm , and a farm that has its success of your legacy .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , those flamingos should not be even in the state of the war .
they breed in a city , where the <unk> <unk> is better for the <unk> .
there 's <unk> miles to farm .
and they 're going to fly <unk> kilometers .
they do that , because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had an kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , miguel , fly <unk> kilometers to the farm and fly fly back to the night ?
do you make the kids ? ''
he looked at me , when i had a song in the tubes of <unk> .
he said , `` no . they do that because food is better . ''
i did n't mentioned the skin of my loved fish , the delicious , and i do n't like a <unk> . i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm not going to leave you almost .
and yet , when i tried to try and tries to try to try to multiply in <unk> , she did n't have <unk> <unk> .
they were <unk> and in fact , when you would take a bites from the ocean .
i mentioned <unk> , and he would <unk> .
he said , `` the skin looks like a sponge .
she 's the last authority before you get in the body .
she 's made of evolution to be <unk> <unk> . ''
and then he added , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , who do n't get their fish , farm . a farm that has its success in its success .
and then i realized that if he says , a farm , which has no <unk> , he had a lot of , and it 's huge , because the water comes from that farm from the river .
it 's a river , which led all the things that rivers are tend to have these things to lead them , chemical pollutants , by <unk> .
and when it was fighting by the system , and this leaves is clean , it 's clean , as it 's <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only one farm , which is not betting their animals , not just a farm , which is a farm in your health , but a farm that literally is a farm , and not only for these fish , but not just for you and me .
because the water is <unk> , it 's in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'll take it , and i should do it , because these <unk> , which is also telling me .
you could say that you 're a recipe for the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
now , what we need is a radical idea of agriculture , of agriculture , from one , which is actually <unk> .
but for many people , this is a little bit too much .
we 're not <unk> , we 're <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that the things are you who tell you the future of the food , someone says , `` hey people , i love pink flamingos , but how do you feed the world ?
how will you feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we do n't produce enough calories to produce the world more than feed .
one billion people will be dying today .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of <unk> illumination in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i do n't like this question because they have the logic of our <unk> , the last 50 years .
<unk> grain on <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> , chemicals on earth , the chicken on fish , and the whole time has just asked , `` if we feed more people , ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the business business of the american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> <unk> capital that allows exactly this production .
this is not a <unk> , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> country , not by pump , but by <unk> water , not by chainsaw , but not by <unk> and nets , and they do n't get in <unk> and nets , but by the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , do n't look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it 's never done something really good to eat .
instead , instead , the environmental model .
this is the one that 's in two billion years .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel ,
businesses that are not the worlds for themselves , businesses , rather than <unk> , businesses , businesses , businesses are growing , rather than only hard , farmers , farmers , but experts are <unk> .
because they 're the ones who are the experts for flavor .
and if i 'm really honest , you 're a better chef than i ever .
you know , this is right , because if the future is good food , you will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to talk to you today , it 's one of the data that we consume , it 's bigger than the sum of your parts , and rather than thinking about how we use information to how we use information , and we see how so trends would be able to see it , and we see so trends that would be
so what we 're seeing here is a typical park in age .
so the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter to a particular cause of a cause , let 's accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that 's because in the <unk> , the people on the <unk> are , and they have over the <unk> .
we can go on a step out and then bring up the data and see that <unk> , and cancer is the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we 're going to go on , and after age , we see 40 years or younger , and we see the other people that accidents are actually concerned about the people who are concerned about people .
and who looks like that , is true that this is true of men .
so you see that this looks like this looks of information , and data in this way , in this way that 's very often in a living room .
and if we can do this to raw data , why do n't do it for content ?
what we 've got here are the <unk> who have been <unk> in the <unk> .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
you can like to test it to my talk to my day .
with <unk> , you can get to get a decade .
you can jump into a particular year .
you can jump straight to a particular copy .
now , when i look at this , i see the athlete that might appear in this copy and the sports .
i 'm a lance <unk> fan , so i click on it , and i 'm going to show all of it , to me to talk to me in which surgery is going to be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> situation , i could think `` ok , what if i 'm going to look at all the subject ? ''
so i 'm going to go back , and i 'm going to get the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a idea of it , you know that if you put information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you 're not just looking at or not just or <unk> .
you do something that 's a little bit different .
it 's something in between , and we think it 's changing the way that information can be used .
i want to make a little bit more on what a little bit crazy .
what we 've done here is we took each individual <unk> , and they were <unk> on a little bit of <unk> .
the <unk> contains a short and a symbol for the area of it .
i 'm just going to show you the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
and immediately , we get an idea of the themes that are the issues of wikipedia .
now , i 'm going to choose the issue of <unk> .
now , after i 've been elected <unk> , i know that the <unk> who are <unk> at most of the year , the <unk> of the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single <unk> .
this is just to see when you step back and look at all .
<unk> on a particular of these <unk> , then i can go into the subject of time , `` time , '' <unk> people in the year , and all the time .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are <unk> . some of the science . some people are still less , from the economy , here 's my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , a ted prize winner .
so we can jump up to jump , and looking at all the ted prize in the ted .
you see , we 're looking at the first time in the web as if it 's really a network , not only from side , but it 's much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else could be a little surprise .
i just show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i do n't want to call a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can look at the <unk> , and we 're looking at this , and we 're going to look at these <unk> , and we 're going to bring these <unk> .
so i can go back a step back , and just jump to a specific <unk> .
so that 's why , because you just look at the looking at the looking at the looking at websites in this way , all the <unk> in the same way .
so i can see in my course , in a particular <unk> way .
so here 's the state of the entire demonstration i 've ever been going to go up .
and i can kind of all of all , what i 've been looking at now , again , again .
and , when i go back to it again , and i look at all , i can look at this , maybe i think , i think , maybe i was looking for my <unk> , and here , i looked for <unk> , and here 's my name of the humor , or here to live in life .
and from here , i can go into the side , and you 'll call it back .
it 's a metaphor that will be used again , and each time it 's bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
in the moment , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the curse in the <unk> .
we talk about `` <unk> in information . ''
what if we could turn these situation and the internet on the head , so that 's what we 're going to go to a one of the other things , and then you can go to lots of things , and then see what otherwise would be stuck ?
if we can do this , then this is going to be a <unk> , maybe a new source of information information .
and , instead , instead of moving in information , we can know it .
and when we know , maybe we can take the wisdom of it .
so i hear that , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> science fiction .
in my school , i went to school in school , every day , every day every day .
and my nose had always been in a book , a <unk> , which my thought of language in other worlds , and my inner language , <unk> curiosity .
and the curiosity also came in , when i was not in school , by the forests , traveled and <unk> , and they were <unk> , frogs , frogs and <unk> and fashion and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
i was totally <unk> , you know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of detail .
and my love to science fiction seemed to <unk> in my surroundings , because back in the late '60s , we went to the moon and early in the winter .
jacques <unk> came into our living room with his seminal <unk> shows that we had animals and places and places , and a world have been filled with us to imagine .
so that 's probably a really good thing to do this .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video video games , this <unk> <unk> with computer-generated imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had all of the time we had to read when kids read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the screen in our head .
my response to this is the <unk> and paint from aliens , alien worlds , robots , and all the things .
in math , i was caught the teachers , as i hid in the textbooks , <unk> , <unk> .
the creativity had to get out of it .
and what happened was something interesting . what was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows , was the idea of a unknown world in our earth itself .
certainly , i would never get a quiet world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely .
but there was a world i could actually be in the earth , and she was as amazing and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic and exotic , as i had read this books .
so i decided to be 15 ,
the only problem is that i lived in a little village in canada , a thousand kilometers from the next ocean .
but i did n't get it down .
i 'm betting my father , until he finally got a <unk> in <unk> in <unk> , new york , finding right on the other side of the <unk> , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in the winter in the winter in the winter in <unk> , new york .
but the ocean , but the ocean is a real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since the 40 years , the 40 years of <unk> are over the water . i spent about three hours of <unk> in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the <unk> ocean , so rich , the rich world , is to be so rich , how we really ca n't imagine it .
and the heart of nature is no barriers , which is in our own , <unk> human imagination .
until today , days , i feel the deepest awe of what i see on my <unk> .
and my love to the ocean is in the same psychotherapy as well , and the .
when i was a <unk> , it was the <unk> .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner line , telling stories , with my need to create images .
and as a kid , i had <unk> and so .
so , the path of the path , images and stories .
and of course , the stories i was <unk> from the <unk> , `` terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> , i could connecting my preference for the <unk> , and they 're connecting with the <unk> .
so , my two passions , my two passions .
something interesting happened in `` <unk> '' : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we took on <unk> animation ,
what 's came out was the first <unk> <unk> that ever been in a film .
so the movie did n't have money to be a money , right , he was just playing his <unk> , but i realized something amazing : the audience was on the world , like <unk> from the magic .
according to arthur , is the law are <unk> technology and magic .
so you saw something magic .
and that 's what i found is incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , this must be in the <unk> . ''
so we went to `` terminator two , '' my next movie , has a lot .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal . the success of the success had to come from how that effect come .
and it worked . again , we had a whole magical design , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we did n't have a little bit more money .
and from these two experiences , a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend of <unk> who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was called digital <unk> .
and the idea of this company was to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
and that 's what we did and give us a advantage of a advantage of advantage .
but in the middle of the '90s , we realized that we had in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we had started in the company , it was actually started <unk> .
i wrote this piece of the mouse , which is the bar of visual effects and <unk> effects in very new heights , with lifelike , expressive characters , and the <unk> should be <unk> .
but the bar <unk> , and the bar , and the people in my company , told me that we 're not able to do that in the way that we 're able to do that .
so i started that , and i made these other movie about the great ship , the goes on .
the <unk> <unk> , i sold the <unk> and julia and juliet , it became a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
but i would actually want to have the real <unk> of titanic .
that 's what i did .
this is the truth . the studio knew that .
but i 'm convinced you , by looking at the train , we call the real train .
we 're going to show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is incredibly important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i 'm going to <unk> them a expedition .
sound crazy . but this is back to it that your imagination can create a reality .
and we actually started a reality six months later , in a russian months , in a russian <unk> , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was the real titanic by a <unk> .
this was no movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really did n't know me .
and the whole thing was enormous . we had to build cameras and <unk> and everything possible .
and i realized how much these <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you 're going to go into this capsule , then you 're going to come in this dark , <unk> environment , where no hope is on saved when you do n't make it back .
and i thought , `` wow , this is as i would be in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was interested in the study of the deep deep ocean .
anyway , from the part of curiosity and science , it was all . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could n't give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside the <unk> .
in some of the next thing , i 've seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes , things that had never seen before , and for the science of the science , when we saw it , i had no words in the time .
so that 's what i was right now , and i wanted to be more .
and then i met a little bit of an unusual decision .
and after the titanic , i told me , `` okay , i want to put my <unk> in hollywood to be a filmmaker in hollywood and will be a while . ''
and then we started , we started to go to the <unk> , and they were working with <unk> .
we went back to the olympic titanic .
we took little robots that we had built a <unk> .
our intent was , to look at the inside of the ship , which is never been done before .
nobody had ever had the inside of the <unk> . you had no tools . so we developed the technology .
now , and there 's now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is quite like this <unk> , and from which i know that the band had played there .
and i 'm flying with a little bit of the ship .
i 'm actually <unk> it , but my mind is within the <unk> .
it felt when i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> , which i 've ever experienced . because before i was a vacuum , i 've always been able to show what the same was in the <unk> of the <unk> , i was left tired of <unk> , when we were
and this kind of was a precise replica of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
and she made this kind of <unk> that you can use such a <unk> and so that 's how to your own consciousness in the vehicle .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a little bit of view of what might happen in some decades , if you have <unk> , to do something like , in all kinds of things that i can imagine .
so after that led , we started seeing what we had seen in the bottom , really appreciate , for example , this <unk> , where we saw this incredibly astonishing animals , but that 's kind of alien , but there 's the scale .
they live with <unk> .
they 're not true in the sunlight because we 're doing this .
and so you see animals that are going to go to a 500 degree c , which is that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was very interested in the same time , which was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and to do nasa , and in the <unk> <unk> , and you 're going to go to russia , and they 're going to go to russia , from the mission of the <unk> of
this was fascinating .
but at the end , it was in the end of it , i was <unk> with us in the deep ocean .
and i took them with and <unk> access to the world , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people , people who were interested in the extreme situations . i took them to the vents for the vents so that they could look around , and so
we were doing <unk> , but we actually did science .
so the circle between my existence as a <unk> , then as a child , and the plays in reality .
in the course of these <unk> , i 've learned a lot .
i 've learned a lot of science , but i 'm now now think you have to think a director of a director , a leader , a leader .
but i do n't really understood a lot of leadership before i was doing this trip .
because of a particular point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what 's coming ? ''
these stinking films do n't bring us money .
we 're just playing the <unk> . it 's no turning back .
i think i think i think , i think of the titanic and `` avatar '' and `` avatar '' and would have a place in a towel on a towel .
i 've all these films , these <unk> , for a very little audience .
no fame , no honor , no credit , no money . what do you do ?
you 're doing it , and you 're going to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , you 're doing it . you 're making it in the <unk> , and because of the weird link , which is , when a little group of people are ,
because we 've done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked for years , and we 've got two to three months in the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have to be a view of each other , because you have a task to explain .
when you go to country , and you know , `` we had to do , and we had to do it , the <unk> , which is the whole technology , and the things that 's in the world 's <unk> , you know , it 's like the other people , '' and that 's like the other people , the other people , you know , it 's like the other people , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , the other people , you know , it 's like the
there 's a connection , a link to respect .
so when i was coming back to turn my next movie `` avatar , i tried to apply the same leadership policies , which is that you get his team and find out respect .
and it became really transformed .
so i stood back with a little kid on a little kid on a little kid on a little kid on the <unk> area , and we turned `` avatar with a new technology that did n't yet before .
it 's incredibly exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we became a long period of four years to a real family .
and by that way , my kind of way , my kind of thing changed .
there was people who thought we 'd have this <unk> , yes , in the planet .
and for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , which is the way that has changed .
so what can we have to conclude ?
what are we learned ?
i think the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the movements of your team is more important than the world 's <unk> .
and i get young filmmaker , who say , `` give me a advice , how i could do something like this . ''
and i say , `` do n't give you one .
and that 's another thing for you , do n't do you for yourself , do n't do you against themselves . but you take risks on you . ''
the nasa has a <unk> : `` fail is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study , failure has to be a alternative , because it guarantees it in a <unk> .
no big achievement , the innovation , was ever been looking at risk .
you have to be prepared to take these risks .
this is the idea that i 'd like to give you with the path . fail . it 's not a alternative , fear , fear . thank you .
today i 'm talking about energy and climate .
and that 's surprising , perhaps , because my favorite features of the foundation are primarily about vaccines and seeds , to provide things that we have to make and provide the poorest billion of a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , which is even more important than the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to be grown over many years . it 's too much more difficult to rain . the things are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be done as it can not be irrelevant .
it leads to the <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to rape .
so , it will be a climate effect for you .
it 's also important for them for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce one thing , the price of the cost is to <unk> energy in the most effective most effective .
well , the <unk> is about time .
in fact , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
the <unk> , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we 've got mad , <unk> materials , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , when we 're reducing the price -- let 's cut the price cut down -- we 're going to meet a new barrier , and they 're going to move to co2 with co2 .
co2 warms , the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the co2 <unk> , which leads to the <unk> , and these <unk> are some very negative effects . the effects on the weather and maybe worse , which is the surprising ecosystems to be able to adapt to these <unk> change , and then
now , the exact connection between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there is certain of how bad these consequences are . but they 're very bad !
i have asked the <unk> times : `` do we really get down to zero ?
does n't have half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we get near zero , is going to increase the temperature down .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than saying , we 've got a 3.5 meter of truck , who has to come under one three feet .
this is to go down to bottom , on zero .
well , we are <unk> a lot of <unk> , over 26 billion tons .
each americans are about 20 tons of tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it 's about five tons of tons of the planet .
and somehow we need to make changes that lower on zero .
it 's been <unk> .
only different economic changes are actually influenced by , and we need to have to be a reduction of disease , and to a reduction in zero .
and this equation has four factors . a little bit , they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- the co2 , which you want to get to zero , and that will depend on the cost of the human being in the service of the service , which is a human being in the average of the service , which is
so let 's look at each factor of one factor , and let 's think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers have to come to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let 's go through .
first , we have the population .
today , there 's a billion people .
and it 's on nine billion to go to nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , we could lower 10 percent to 15 percent , but we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that 's all the food that we eat , clothing , <unk> , heating .
these are very good things , and it means that means that services are moving to each other on the planet .
it 's great that this number is going to go .
in the rich world , in the upper world , we could have been able to make <unk> and less use , but in the average , that number is going to be going to double each year and double the number of
so here we see a very basic service . there 's the same light , so you can read the homework .
and these students did n't have it , so they go out , and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally good news .
we have something that does n't go up .
because of different successes in the <unk> , by other ways , in new ways of <unk> , there 's a lot of services , which is a lot of services to grow their goods in 90 percent .
in other <unk> , like the manufacturing process of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , it 's very much more very much more .
if we 're optimistic , if we 're optimistic , maybe a factor of three or maybe even have a factor .
but the first three factors , we 're now now from 26 billion tons , and that 's not just out .
so let 's look at the fourth factor , and this is going to be a <unk> -- this is the amount of co2 that will be <unk> .
it turns out to be the question , if you can get it on zero .
when you burn coal , no .
when you burn natural gas , no .
nearly every <unk> for electricity today today , except the renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i do the term , `` wonders , i do n't have the impossible .
the <unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the evolution of many of these wonders .
typically there is no <unk> , you need a miracle to a particular date .
typically , you 're just going to go back and some of them , not .
but in this case , we have to give up , and a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked me , how can i really <unk> ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration , which is the idea of people on ?
i was reminded me at last year , when i brought the <unk> , and somehow the people liked it .
the idea was really tangible , you know , you know that there are people who are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is one .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
and you have told me that you ca n't bite you . actually , you 're not going to leave the glass .
well , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they do n't all get much .
we need solutions , either one or many of us have a tremendous scale , and even though , there 's plenty of directions , which are many directions , where people are looking for five , i 'm really just five , that 's the big needs of
i have declined , <unk> , merger and biofuels .
and you might afford a <unk> contribution , and if you expect better than i expect , it 's great , but my boss here is that we have to give all of these five work , and we ca n't give up of them because they 're going to give us a significant problems .
let 's first look at the burn fossil fuels , the burning of the coal or natural gas or natural gas .
what you have to do is , maybe it might be simple , but it 's not . you need to get all the co2 , which is going to go out of the <unk> , and then there 's a pressure , and then there 's somewhere there is there .
there 's some <unk> , which is the <unk> of a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it 's going to get 100 percent of the co2 , is a big challenge , but the largest problem here is the <unk> .
who is going to make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally has a lot of billion times bigger than any kind of junk that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a hard <unk> .
next one : <unk> .
and there 's also three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question is to say that you can really feel wrong , despite the human state that 's not used for weapons .
and what do you do with it ?
because even though he 's not very large , there 's a lot of consider .
so three difficult problems that might be soluble , and that 's why you should work .
the last three of five one i 've summarized .
it 's renewables as they often be called <unk> .
and also , even -- although it 's great is that they do n't need a fuel -- you have some <unk> .
one is the <unk> that these technologies produce dramatically lower than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , a thousand place as a normal power .
and then these vents are <unk> .
the sun seems to be the whole day , they 're not going to be every day , and they 're not even <unk> .
so you have to have , when you have to depend on these vents , you have to have a way to get the energy in times when they do n't have available .
so there 's big <unk> . there 's challenges in transmission . if we say , if we say , if we say , is that the power of the country is not just the technology , you have to deal with the risk of where there 's the energy .
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i 've all kinds of batteries , which are made , the computer , mobile phone , <unk> , <unk> , which is , and i found out of the electronic energy , and i found out that all the batteries we 're going to produce each other , less than you could produce batteries , less than 10 minutes ,
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that 's going to be 100 better than the marketers of time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
that happens when you try to do this , these <unk> vents are about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest .
if you want to have 100 percent of it , you need a incredible <unk> .
now , where do we go , what is the right thing ?
one `` manhattan project ? how do we go to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of firms who are working on . hundreds of thousands .
in each of these five areas we need 100 people .
in many , you 'll say , they 're crazy ! that 's good .
i believe in the ted group , there 's a lot of , who are already engaged in .
bill 's big firms , which has a called a called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies making the great things and have interesting opportunities , and i 'm trying to support that .
nathan <unk> and i suppose a company , who might be <unk> to the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in <unk> ; willpower , <unk> .
the development has been in this industry for some time , so it 's no great surprise that some good concepts around .
and the <unk> means that instead of a part of the <unk> , which is a percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn 99 percent , the <unk> .
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it for a long time , but you could n't make a reasonable simulate whether it would work , but it 's modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , yes , yes , yes , yes , it looks like this , it looks like this .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it 's a lot more better .
in fact , you burn the junk , and you can even use the waste of these reactors as a <unk> .
instead of <unk> , you burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is worth <unk> , a little bit like a candle .
you see that there 's a kind of <unk> , often , as `` <unk> wave . ''
the enemy is the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that 's 99 percent . you have the part of it , so it 's called <unk> <unk> .
this is the u.s. u.s. companies for hundreds of years .
and when you 're cheap and simple , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's a example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let 's think about how we should measure our success .
how should our statement look like ?
well , let 's go to the target we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many of a 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it 's really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be generated in poor countries , and still is still going to be agriculture . hopefully <unk> and cement is completely clean .
so to reach these 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other note says if we use the <unk> technology , whether it 's in all developed countries , and we 're on the path to get them .
this is great important .
this is going to be a shift projection .
when we go back to the 2020 ?
it should be the two elements .
we should be using the <unk> use to get resources to the way . the less we <unk> , the lower is the <unk> and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note is the note that we have companies who do n't completely completely completely completely completely completely totally <unk> , just a moment , or even something less important , or even something less important , which is the <unk> of the innovation .
these are the breakthroughs we have to pursue with <unk> and we can measure that , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's a lot of great books in this topic .
the al gore called the choice and david <unk> , `` <unk> energy <unk> the <unk> air . ''
they 're really going to go through and create a frame , where this is going to be discussing , because we need to support for all sides .
there 's a couple of thing that needs to come together .
that 's a wish .
a very <unk> wish we invent this technology .
if you 're just a desire for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a <unk> , and the love i could choose , or i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , i 'm going to take .
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get these desire , the digging are going to dig between the long term and a range of people , between the united states between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost all of these two billion countries are going to be very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
for what ?
we need to use more <unk> .
when countries are doing in places like <unk> , you do n't just talk about co2 .
you should talk to these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous tiny money that are going to be spent for these cutting-edge approaches .
we need <unk> , co2 control , <unk> <unk> trade , and we have an <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we need to go to the <unk> and whole , and also the things that are going to be done by the government .
it 's a important wish , but i think we can meet him .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better to understand something -- first , you can give us a idea of scale of the investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , which is to get a great scientist , which we 've done , and even if we have tested some 10 million . and even if we could test our materials in a russian reactor , it 's just
the difficult step is the building of the first <unk> , another billion , which is the ground of the first place .
once the first thing is when he 's going to be like this , everything is quite clear , because the economy that is so different as we know .
so to understand the right thing , which is a vertical <unk> at the ground , which is a vertical <unk> <unk> , this cancer system , and then the process starts to the bottom ?
bg : exactly . now you have to be . now you have to be new into the reactor , so there 's a lot of people , so many of the controls , and many controls , this thing you can go wrong , and this thing you 're going to make it 's wrong and things that 's going to come up and do it . that 's not good .
but if you have a low-cost fuel , you can use it in 60 years -- think of a pillar -- you bury them , without all the <unk> .
and it 's there and <unk> 60 years , and then it 's done .
a <unk> , which is a solution to the waste .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the waste is : you can sit there -- there 's a lot of waste with this method -- and then you take it in the next thing and burn it down .
and we start using the garbage , which is already there , which is in these <unk> or <unk> of the reactors . that 's our <unk> .
so , this is what these reactors was , which is what we put in our fill and it will be reduced to the <unk> effect .
but while they were talking about these world about these opportunities ,
where is the biggest interest , what really do ?
bg : so now we have a place , and there 's a lot of more interesting <unk> for all of the names . there 's big interest in russia , and people in russia , india , china , and i 've met the minister of the energy , and talked about how to fit
i 'm optimistic . you know , you know , the french and japanese did something in the direction .
this is a flavor of a thing that has been done .
this is an important step ahead , but it 's like a faster , and some countries have this built built , so everyone is done , so everyone who has been done a little bit , a <unk> mechanism in our first .
in your idea : <unk> and probability really are actually going to call your life ?
bg : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent 20 years .
this is the <unk> that we 've introduced us the <unk> , which we have to have to do .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is doing good , and that 's a big wish that could be easy .
and fortunately , there 's dozens of firms today , and we need hundreds of these things that work , if their work work that work to be able to work for their channel , for example .
and it would be at the best , if it can make several , because you could use a mixture of it .
in each case , we need a solution .
are the great possible breakthroughs , is that the largest thing you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
it 's no longer , but the power is so much more important .
there are other innovative companies .
you know , we do n't know your work , not so good as these , but there 's the <unk> way , that 's another approach .
there 's a texture <unk> , which seems to be difficult , but maybe that 's going to tell us this .
and so , there 's different , but the nice thing is that a <unk> times a million times as much energy , and that 's why they can deal with the problems , and the cost of the problems , the footprint and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , the potential and the cost , and then the cost of the country , the potential and the cost , the potential and other things , and other things , the impact , and other things ,
if that does n't work what ?
have we have to be able to be square to try to make the <unk> stable stable ?
bg : if you get in this situation , it 's like a lot of heart attack , and what is you going to do ? what does you do ?
there 's a <unk> called <unk> , which is called different techniques to be <unk> warming , so we had 20 or 30 years to be taken us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope we do n't need that .
some people say , you do n't want to do n't work on insurance 's insurance , because you might be lazy because you 're going to be lazy , because you 're going to continue to save the <unk> .
i do n't know if you 're smart , if you get to the importance of this problem , but there 's a funny thing in <unk> , whether you have to have the things that 's going to get faster , or this innovation we expect .
<unk> : did you have a or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the scientific arguments are very little .
tell you that there are negative implications to do with the clouds , which is things ?
there 's very , very few things that you can tell at all of which there 's a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is so similar to aids .
you 're making a mistake now , and you pay very much later .
and so the idea of all , now , if you all have all kinds of <unk> problems , in something that has just later , which is that the investment is not so obvious , and in fact , the ipcc report report on the worst possible world , and say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry .
but my dream here is , if you do it , and at the same time , the global ocean is going to say , `` okay , i 'm not interested in the atmosphere , i 'm not interested in it , i wish it 's not to accept it , but i 'm going to accept it , but i 'm going to accept it because it 's cheaper than the previous method . ''
and that would be the answer to the <unk> point that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals , the other goals of malaria , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that 's going to continue to invest in the basis of resources , to invest in the way that we can do better .
bg : well , the real spending for research -- say , the u.s. spending have to spend 10 billion per year than you do today -- this is not so dramatic .
including other things not suffer .
and you get too large <unk> , and here 's reasonable people , if you 've got something that is not economic , and it 's trying to finance this . for me .
it 's because you 're very quickly , and funded by learning , and i think we should have more things that have more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get a very high school teacher , you can keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here could be five times so much for our energy without changing his lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even with <unk> .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research in the research ? ''
he 's still still , because of its former stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very low group , and that 's why it 's now the <unk> .
and this is a line i think of is appropriate .
the research , it 's just crazy as a <unk> .
bill , i think i 'm telling all of all people , if i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , there 's a little bit of ted , peter <unk> , called `` the <unk> . ''
the idea is quite simple . <unk> need to have the biggest <unk> structure of structure with 20 <unk> , ca n't get <unk> tape , ca n't build <unk> .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , even though it 's really easy , it 's actually really hard because it 's people really work very quickly .
and so i thought that this is a interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since then , i 've done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , <unk> , and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there 's something to share with the deep stage in the nature of collaboration .
now , usually the most people are looking at the <unk> themselves .
you talk about how it 's looking at how it 's going to be , <unk> power .
and then they invest in planning and organization , and they came and put <unk> .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> of the <unk> structures .
and finally , before you do n't have time more , somebody takes the marshmallow , and they put it gently on the top , and `` <unk> '' ! ' they put their work .
but then , what is , is , is that the `` <unk> '' is being <unk> , because the weight of the <unk> is that the whole thing is and <unk> .
there 's a number of people who have a lot more than a lot of <unk> , and under the worst , there are fresh <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused and they 're really confused and producing really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also a team of <unk> <unk> , and under the best , there are <unk> <unk> .
and that 's quite astonishing .
as peter , peter told you , they do n't create the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how does this come ? why ? what is that ?
and peter 's telling : no one of the kids are going to be in time to be time in the <unk> .
they do n't invest in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that is that <unk> were engaged , to find a real plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you do n't have time more and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> are different is that they start building the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , and that they 're going to <unk> the <unk> on the top , so that the way to repair the possibility of <unk> prototypes .
now , the kind of collaboration is that these kinds of collaboration as a core of a <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids get <unk> and what does n't work .
this is the performance of working with prototypes , but we see how different teams operate .
the average for most of the average is about <unk> , <unk> , provide half of the lawyers , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they 're understanding , and we 're using geometric geometric patterns to build the key to stable structures .
ceos are about average . but there 's interesting .
you get a <unk> <unk> on the team , you 'll be significant better .
it 's unbelievable . you see and see , `` this team is going to win . ''
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they 're leading the process , you understand him .
and this team that regulates their bodies and on the work is the performance of the team of the team .
so , to 3d skills and <unk> and the combination of success .
when you have 10 teams who have a typical system , you get about six , the robust structures .
now i tried a little thing .
i thought we were going to get the <unk> .
so i got a <unk> $ <unk> for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if you did n't have a <unk> high school , he would have worn home .
so is it not interesting that high school have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
now , what do you think ?
now , you understand the advantage of the <unk> .
so , from the same , bad team of a under the best .
it 's powered the highest construction in the least of time .
so there 's been <unk> lessons for us , and it 's about the power of it .
and you might like , why would anyone actually invest a <unk> ?
the reason is , i 'm <unk> digital tools and processes to help help teams , cars , video games , `` <unk> <unk> . ''
and what the <unk> is doing is , they helps to identify the hidden assumptions .
because open , each project has its own marshmallow .
so the challenge is to create a common experience , a common language , or a common language , and <unk> to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience that simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can be <unk> .
it 's a blog where you see how you build the <unk> .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples from all the world , how people are hawking and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think the construction is actually a <unk> sports .
it 's going to be all the senses that we 're doing all of our senses on the task , and we 're using our thinking , how to our senses , in the challenge , the challenge .
and sometimes a little prototype of these experience is everything it takes us from a `` <unk> '' moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so , we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time machine .
and everyone has to be in this room .
and you can go in the past , you can go in the future ; you can go to the future ; you ca n't stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i 'd like my friends in last time , and they wanted to go in the past .
i do n't know . they wanted back to the time before , before it had cars or twitter , or `` america 's <unk> . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of just find out to nostalgia recognition .
and that 's what i do .
i 'm not part of this group , i need to say .
i do n't want to be in the past , and i do n't , because i am a study .
it 's because the possibility of the planet is not going back to the planet .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most successful time that there was on this planet , no matter what 's scale you do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , opportunities .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> had died when they were 60 .
my grandparents ' shoes were this number of 70 .
my parents are the 80 in turkey .
so there should be better at a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not even people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a kid who is born in new delhi can not expect to live so long as the richest man on the world .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . smallpox has been <unk> billion people in this planet .
you 've got the demographics of the earth in a way , how it does n't have war .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we 've got them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases , millions of us , millions of us only have a generation only under one generation , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody know what that 's ?
so , we can be able to have modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people who are the aid of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look , whether it works if it does n't do it , one of the great risk of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they 've been talking about it .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world are hungry every day .
this number is going to go , and it goes very quickly , and that 's an <unk> .
and not just that , we have used our imagination to celebrate the world to celebrate the world .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , oil , gas , and it 's soon , and it 's soon as we do n't disappear from this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food , which is going to feed billions of people , without the country you live in .
i think we can make these world with energy , and it 's the world that do n't destroyed it .
i think that really , and no , that 's not a wishful wishful wishful thinking .
but this is me telling me at night -- one of the things that i think i 've never had a lot of all over the night . we 've been able to need science progress as well as well .
and we 've never been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and we 're in the verge of astonishing , amazing events on many areas , and yet , i really think we have hundreds of , 300 years ago , to find the education system , where we have progress in this things that we have to have over these things that are <unk>
people <unk> themselves in their faith , and that 's so profound that you ca n't release them .
it 's not even the truth of it .
and you hear , everyone has a right on his opinion , even a right on its opinion .
but you know what you do n't have right ?
you do n't have right on your own facts . <unk> , you do n't .
and i needed a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a article about vaccination for `` the new yorker , '' a little article .
and i was amazed at the end of the resistance to the resistance of the resistance to what the most effective thing in health in the history of humanity is .
i did n't know what i should do , so i did just do what i 'm going to do , i wrote a article and ran on .
and soon , soon i wrote a article about <unk> changed .
same thing is , just bigger .
people were crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about it , and i could n't understand why people thought that would be `` <unk> , '' why they believed that molecules in a particular rather than a random kind of
but you know , i 'm doing what i do . i 've got the article on it .
i mean , i am journalist .
we call it , we 're eating food that 's okay .
but this article made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it out .
and that 's because that <unk> , which were me crazy at all the time .
these were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so much .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we have a point where we do n't have the same relationship to progress in the progress .
we talk about <unk> .
we talk ironic , with little <unk> that is , `` progress . ''
okay , there 's reasons why , and i think of what reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of science , and there 's no reason why it should n't be so .
you can call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weapons , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we believed that they were still right . so , they were skeptical .
ask you ask , ask the evidence , require evidence .
do n't have a given thing .
but now there 's the evidence , if you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we 're not good at it .
and i can say that in the reason that we 're going to live in a epidemic of fear of fear , and hopefully it never never seen again .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that was <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
very scary .
a lot of studies were done to see whether it was true .
a lot of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no correlation .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't power because we believe in excitement , we believe what we see to see what 's going to make us really feel .
we do n't believe a bunch of documents from a <unk> , who are data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was <unk> .
and because of the fact that the fact , the u.s. is one of the only country on the world , which is immunization for <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand this . i do .
because somebody 's shoes here ?
has a single one in the audience ever see someone in the audience ?
it 's not really often .
happening is happening in this country , but 160,000 times in the world .
these are a lot of deaths from <unk> , 20 pounds .
but because that 's not happening here , we can have a <unk> , and people like <unk> <unk> are going to be around and <unk> from <unk> , like <unk> and larry king live .
and you can do it because it 's cause and correlation .
they do n't understand that these things seem to be in the same , but almost never ever be the same .
and that 's something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he 's <unk> of one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle , there 's not so much .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he 's just developed a pair of other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 kids per year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
now , this is good , besides that paul <unk> and says , and say how hard you are , and that people would just stop in the <unk> .
and that 's actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public language , he ca n't tell without armed <unk> .
he gets to go home , because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul did a <unk> .
i do n't need that , but it 's a lot of <unk> .
you get it up , you get back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and that 's going on .
we 've got in this country now .
and that will be worse , and pretty soon , kids are going to die again , because this is just one question of numbers .
and they 're not just dying in <unk> .
what about wet ? do we do this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine wrote a few weeks ago , and she says i 'm a little bit too <unk> .
nobody said that before .
they would not be their kid with <unk> , not .
<unk> .
why ? because we do n't have a <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country .
now , i do n't know , i do n't know somebody else in lagos , and running on los angeles , and it 's about a <unk> .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and it 's going to be long beach , and it 's going to come from this <unk> <unk> .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a <unk> disease , and we do n't know that , because the world works now .
this is the planet that we live . do n't do it as if it 's not .
we love it to lie . we love this .
have you all taken your vitamins ?
<unk> , a little bit of <unk> , you 're going to be able to get you down .
i know that they did this because half of americans do that every day .
you take the stuff , and you take alternative cure , and it does n't make any difference , how often we find that they 're useless .
the data is all the time .
they 're <unk> their urine . more they never never do .
this is okay , you want to do 70 billion dollars to dark urine .
i completely agree .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> business .
we hate a strong government . we do n't trust the system .
and that 's not us . our health system is <unk> .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely cool and <unk> ourselves to us that it can afford .
so we 're going to run away , and where do we go ?
we 're going to go into the poor <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is a serious thing , because this stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i 've got all kinds of little artifacts here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , because i do n't even know what that 's , but we give billions of dollars for it , it 's <unk> .
and you know what ? if i say that , and i would say , i like people and say , `` what does it look ? let 's do what they want .
so you feel good . ''
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
because it does n't care whether it 's the minister of education , `` hmm , i 'm going to avoid the evidence of the experts in mammography , '' or no <unk> who wants to treat their patients with
when you get out on this path where and magic and magic to replace the evidence and science , you get to a place where they do n't want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 400,000 his people to be because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> drugs are much more efficient than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can slow down .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than each other disease .
do n't tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have . they have .
now , the <unk> epidemic , in which we 're right now is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . you have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , each branch , every <unk> , has changed from people .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden .
there was no <unk> .
there was no first time . we 've done it .
we 've done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them has work and not .
we were rid of what did n't work .
now , we can do it , and of course , there 's risk . but we can do something like that , and we can do something like that , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people to prolong millions of people .
do n't you want to do that ?
i have to say that i do n't understand that .
we reject <unk> food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm listening is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we do n't want a huge fields with a thing that is wrong .
we do n't want to <unk> companies .
we do n't want that companies have seeds .
and you know what my answer is ?
yeah , you have right . fix it .
it 's true , we have a massive <unk> , but that 's not science .
it 's nothing to do with science .
it 's fairly , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it 's actually work and not , but the idea that we should n't allow science to do their work , because we have fear is a real end of people , and she 's got millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to grow 70 percent more food than currently .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
marcus : a <unk> .
you need this , and we do n't give them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that has half a billion people .
it 's like a potato .
it 's just a handful of calories . it 's <unk> .
it has no nutrients , it does n't have protein , and scientists just build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food and would n't be blind .
you would n't starve , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it would n't be <unk> <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask , why do we fight this ?
because we do n't want to <unk> genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , to hormones , our <unk> , better food , better food ,
it 's not about rice <unk> , it 's about getting people to get people at life , and it 's going to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do that , if we do so far , we have a guilty that we think , i think , not guilty , the high-tech diet .
there is no other description of what 's happening here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not worthy , and we have to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might say , `` do you want to go in this ridiculous time , and in the future ? ''
everyone 's . i want to be a case .
in the moment , they 're in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can do this time time for everything we want .
we can <unk> them , where we 're going to <unk> them , and we 're going to move them to where we want .
we have to have this conversation , and we need to think , but if we 're going to go into the time period , and we 'll be happy in the future , and we 're happy to have it .
i know that we can have it , and so far as it is about it , what 's what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
and for some time , i 've been interested in the <unk> . it might seem to be curious that a magician was interested in , it 's because i consider it as a deception that 's going to be true , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in a real thing , if someone believes in it ,
and with other words , <unk> <unk> , in some studies have shown in some studies , the <unk> , and that 's just because the person thinks about what 's happening with you , a kind of ... for example , is that the patient believes in the bodies that 's going to be
a deception is going to be a real thing , because somebody 's like it .
so we can also understand each other , i want to understand a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick who has at least since the 1950s .
i have learned it from the <unk> magic of the <unk> <unk> .
i 'm going to do it for them and then explain .
and then i 'll explain why i explain .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand they can study .
i 'm going to be the knife just in my hand .
i <unk> my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing goes down , and from him , i 'll just get my wrist on this wrist here .
in this way , you can see that there 's no time in anything . so long as i 'm going to <unk> here , nothing can come up or come around .
and the goal is quite simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is fine , it 's going to be <unk> through my naked physical <unk> .
in fact , it 's actually quite a place that i can shake it without being <unk> .
nothing goes in my sleeve or there 's no <unk> , and you can study everything .
yay !
now , this is a trick that i often <unk> little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot of deception , when you look at a deception , even though it 's a very simple trick .
probably many of you here are there in the room of this trick .
it works : the way it works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i 'm going to <unk> my wrist , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , and it 's a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist , is that the real secret of the illusion is .
and in the moment , where i 'm going to <unk> my hand , so you see it from the back , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position where he 's <unk> .
amazing trick ?
there 's somebody who would be no childhood .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i got myself , the fingers changes its position .
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't see here , there 's just three fingers : because the mind is and the way that the minds and the way that it is , you do n't know , you know , two , you know , you know , it 's not one , you know , it 's not one , you know , you know , it 's not one , you know , you know , it 's
but that 's what it 's now . and then , i open my hand .
of course , it 's going to be there , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , which is now there .
and if i 'm going to leave my hand , the same thing , the same thing , when i 'm going to whip myself up , it will be hidden through this movement , that the light is <unk> .
i take these hand away . and here 's the knife .
this trick , you can show your friends and the neighbors . thank you .
now , what about the <unk> ?
a year or so , i read a study that was really focused on it .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so that was an amazing thing .
so what it turns out , it turns out , when you provide a <unk> in a white pill in a white pill in a white pill , which is just a round , white pill , which has a particular measurable effect .
but if you get the shape , you know , in a smaller pill , for example , in a smaller pill , and these blue <unk> and a letters that 's actually more effectively .
and that , even though no <unk> -- it 's just <unk> .
but one white pill is not so good as a blue pill .
what ? i was really mad .
but it turns out that it 's not all .
when you take a <unk> , the more effective , it 's more effective than pills .
a colored capsule , which is yellow and at the other red is better than one white capsule .
it 's also a role .
one pill a day , not so much as three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact statistics . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is , is , ...
... that 's a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab the needle .
right ? one syringe with a <unk> -- a <unk> of a <unk> substance , which you 're going to be a patient .
this is a very strong image in your head . that 's much stronger than one white pill .
so this chart is really -- i 'll show you -- i 'll show you another thing when we have a <unk> .
so , the fact is that the white pill does n't seem so good like the blue pill , which is not as good as a capsule that do n't really work like the needle .
and nothing really has a really <unk> quality . it 's just our belief in us in us , which is the stronger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i suppose something obviously is obviously a deception , and it 's going to be a real way .
we know from the study that you have to go to the needle when it is to go .
this is a 18 inches of a long time . she 's very , very , very , very , very <unk> . and i 'll first put it a little bit very low .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> <unk> .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
so i 'm going to stick these needle in my skin , and they run through it until you get back to the other side .
if you 're bad , if you fall in a little bit , if you fall in <unk> -- i 've got this a couple of friends in the hotel room , and some people who did n't know , and it 's a woman
so i 'm going to show you , if you 're a kid , you 'll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , what , i 'm going to do the first <unk> part of here .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also see , but you can also want to do it , if you want .
so , it 's like , right here , where my meat starts to look at the lower part of my <unk> .
do i 'm really happy . does it crazy ?
and now , just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now , we 're in the same situation we had in the <unk> .
it 's about .
but now you ca n't count my finger , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , right ?
i know what the people think if you see this .
you say , `` okay , that 's probably not so stupid and <unk> itself , just to entertain us a few minutes long . ''
well , i 'm going to show you .
how this looks like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people say , `` okay . i do n't see that . ''
the people in the <unk> are going on .
let me show you about it .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can <unk> it .
i 'm sorry . if you 're evil , look , look at the way .
the back of the back or the day later , later , you see later , will say , `` well , yeah , it 's quite impressive , but if it 's a real thing , here 's a hole and there , if it would be real , ''
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yes , there 's it .
now , usually i would have the needle and it would be the needle .
i would show my arm and showing you that there is no wounds .
but i think in this context here , and with the intent , from a deception , i 'm going to make the needle in a deception .
we 're going to have a couple of time in the next days .
i hope you 're looking at it . thank you .
everyone talks about the happiness .
i have a couple of people who have the number of books in the book , which has been published in the age of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the title in the title of the
there 's a big wave of interest in happiness .
there 's a lot of <unk> .
everyone would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tides of the world , there are several cognitive quality , which are going to be impossible to think of happiness .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive fall .
this applies to <unk> , which is thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so disturbing how everyone else is like everyone .
the first of these traps is to fall a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word `` good word is not a useful word , because we use it in a lot of different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning , which we could have to limit on the limit , but in the big and whole , this is something that we 're going to give up , and we 're going to give up the complicated view of what 's going on .
the second trap is , and memory is , and memory is essentially , essentially it 's between happy to his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two different concepts , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that 's the <unk> of the fact that we ca n't think about a situation that affects well-being , without due to warp .
i mean , that 's a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to start with a example of someone who had a <unk> , which is a story , and [ unclear ] he said he was a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and there was a <unk> sound .
and then he added a little bit , really emotional , the whole experience .
but that did n't .
what it had been ruined by the experience of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music ,
she did n't <unk> , because he was the memory with <unk> ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was getting everything , and they had to keep it .
what we really says is that we have to think about ourselves and other people might think of two kinds of self .
there 's a <unk> self who lives in the present and the present way to experience the past again , but basically the present .
it 's the <unk> self , which is the doctor 's doctor , you know , if the doctor asks , `` do it hurts if i 'm going to <unk> it ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that , the <unk> and the story of our lives , and it 's the doctor in the doctor , `` how did you feel the question , ''
or `` what was your journey to albania ? '' or so similar .
these are two very different units , which is the <unk> itself , and the <unk> themselves , and the two of the things are part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that 's really what i think is a very basic response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we do n't just tell stories when we 're telling us to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we 're looking at from our experience is a story .
and let 's start with a example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who are <unk> .
i 'm not going to go into the details . it 's not more painful , but it was painful as these trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds to report .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask , `` who 's got more organized ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b has been <unk> . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain that had a patient , and more .
but now there 's another question : how very these patients thought they were <unk> ?
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient 's a lot of a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how she ends .
and there 's no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clearly .
but one of them is quite worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse is the , where the pain was quite on his peak . it 's a very bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we have asked these people to her <unk> , and too much later , `` how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was much worse for a than b to b .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
from the course of the <unk> itself , it clearly had a <unk> time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we 've done clinical trials , and it 's done , and it 's made , and it 's done , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , and it works , you could actually be able to <unk> the <unk> of the patient in order to put it down to him without <unk>
that 's going to be that the patient 's suffering , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you 've done a few minutes , you did n't have a little bit of the patient 's own a bad self , and you did n't have a much more comfortable in the patient , because you 've got a lot more better in the patient , because you 've given the patient a better story about his experience .
what is a story ?
and that 's true of the stories that the memory makes us give us and it 's true for the stories that we invent .
so , what a story is <unk> are <unk> , great moments and ends .
end is very , very , very important , and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the <unk> self live .
it 's a day of the <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to this moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most of our days of our life -- and i 've done this -- you know , the psychological present in the time , you know , about 10 seconds , you know , there 's about 3,000 million of them .
most of you are completely ignored from the <unk> itself .
and yet , you get some of the impression that what happens in this moments of the <unk> life .
it 's limited resource that we use in this world .
and as we use it , but that 's not the story that makes the most popular self for us .
so we have the <unk> themselves and the <unk> themselves , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the most of time .
from the course of the <unk> self , when you have a vacation , and the second week , the first week , the first week , the first time , the <unk> vacation is going to double twice as well nameless vacation .
that does n't work for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> vacation is less likely to expect to be a little bit more than the <unk> vacation , because there 's no new memories to get a new memory .
they did n't change the story .
and in this way , the critical variable , there 's a <unk> level of different threats itself , and time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> themselves are more than remember and tell stories .
it 's actually one of the one that makes the decisions , because if you have a patient who had two <unk> in two different surgeons , and you decides that the <unk> who has the memory that 's less bad , and that 's the surgeon that 's been selected .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this election .
in fact , we do n't choose between <unk> . we choose between the memory of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't normally think of our future .
we think about our future , memory .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> themselves , and you can think about the <unk> itself as a , which is the most part of the <unk> themselves in terms of experiences that do n't need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we 're going to get vacation a lot of the case , which is , we 're going to run mentally relative to the services of the <unk> itself .
and that 's a little bit difficult to justify , i think .
i mean , how very <unk> we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations for the dominance of <unk> self .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation , which we 've done a few years ago in antarctica , which was probably the best vacation i 've ever had , and i think i think in the relationship , i think about how often i think about other <unk> .
and i probably probably have a memory of these <unk> journey , i would say about 25,000 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i 've ever opened the folder my folder with 600 images , i spent another lesson .
well , these are three weeks , and that 's a half a half a year .
there 's the disagreement .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , like little <unk> , i have to do things like that , but even if you do it a real question , why do we give the memory of your weight to the weight that we give
so i want to think you want to think about a thought of thought .
imagine her next vacation , you know that at the end of the <unk> , you know , they 're not going to be a <unk> drug , so they 're not remember .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose another inch , there 's a conflict between your two ways of self , and you have to think about how conflict do , and that 's really obvious , because if you think of time , you think , and if you think of time , you know , and if you can think of the sense of memory , and if you could think of the sense of memory you could think of memory .
so why we choose the <unk> , which is that we have a problem , which is a choice between the two ways of self .
now , the two ways of self is going to be able to be two terms of happiness .
in fact , there are two concepts of the happiness we can use , one per face .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> yourself ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> themselves ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and by the way , we 're now able to get a pretty good idea from the happiness of the <unk> self .
if you ask for the happiness of the <unk> , it 's a very different thing .
that 's not how happy a person alive .
it 's how happy or <unk> the person is , when these person is thinking about her life .
very different concept .
everyone who do n't be different to these terms of the happiness , and i belong to a lot of researchers about well-being that have been a lot of happiness in the right .
the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> self , and the happiness of the <unk> self has been discovered in the last few years , and now you 're going to get to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , where more than a half million people have been asked about a million people who are thinking about her life and over their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started talking about the happiness of the two ways of self .
and the main reasons that we have , i think , is that they 're really different .
you can know how to be happy with his life , and teach them not much about how happy he lives alive and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation .
what that means is that if you would meet someone , and you would tell you you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know ?
well , you would have something about his scale , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone 's life has his life than eight pounds of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his <unk> .
so correlation is tiny .
we know something about what happiness is determines .
we know that money is very important , is very important .
and we know that happiness is being being engaged with people who are going to spend time we like , with people that we like .
there 's other delight , but that 's a dominant .
so if you 're lucky to maximize , you 're going to be able to make a very different things .
and the conclusion from what i 've said is that we do n't want to give us to give us a little bit more than a substitute of well-being .
it 's a completely different word .
well , very soon , a different reason that we ca n't realize about happiness is that we do n't think about the same things , if we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , you 're not the correct answer .
if you ask these question , you know that people have to be happier in california , if you have , let 's live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it 's not even important to the <unk> self , decides that are happy .
but , because the <unk> self is responsible , you can go to the end of california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track of what happens to people who are moving to california to become happier .
well , you 're not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you 're going to think you are happier , because if you 're going to think about it , you 're thinking about how many of the weather is in ohio , and they 're going to get the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we first got a few weeks ago , you know , you 've got a very interesting outcome that came from this <unk> survey .
is that something that you can give us because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : safe .
i think i think the most interesting results that we 've found in the <unk> survey is a number that we have absolutely not been being found .
we found this in terms of the happiness of the <unk> itself .
when we looked at how emotions with the income .
and it turns out that under 60,000 dollars of 60,000 dollars , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 20,000 , but it 's a big representative sample of 400 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they 'll be more happy , the poorer , you 're going to be .
and we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not a <unk> , but that lack of money , is certainly not in money , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , you get another story .
the more money you do is , the <unk> is it .
it 's not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american development , it 's about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this kind of scientific idea , i mean , everything seems to the head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country does n't take a kind of an idea how much of it would be based on policy ?
dk : you know , i think there is a <unk> of the role of environmental policy .
the <unk> is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , they 're going to happen in other countries .
people are , to realize that you should think of happiness if you think about policy .
it 's going to be a while , and the people are going to explore whether you want to explore , or whether you want to study <unk> , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
so how to happiness can be very different from how you think , and whether you think about it , or whether you think about it , or whether you think about the <unk> yourself , or whether you think of the <unk> themselves .
it 's going to affect policy , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you 're <unk> to measure the population of the population .
that 's going to be , i think , in the next few decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this is the subject , or i should not have the most exciting political debate in the track of the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i make video games .
i think now , i think about 10 years now , and my goal is for the next decade , it 's just as easy to save the world in the reality , to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to persuade more people , including all of all , more time with play more and <unk> games .
currently , we spend three billion hours a week with <unk> .
some of them might think , `` this is a whole bunch of time for games . ''
perhaps much time , if you think about how many problems we need to solve the real world in the real world .
but in fact , my research in the center for the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive this next century on this planet , we need to increase the time in change .
i think that the time needed a long time in 21 billion hours a week .
so this is the first thing , maybe first of us , so i think , i think , so i think it can be , so , if we 're going to do it : if we 're going to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts , global conflicts and obesity , for example , we need to play for the next week for the end of the next decade
no , i mean , really seriously .
why ? this picture is quite exactly why i think that games are so profound for survival of human species in the future .
this is a picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to make the feelings of play . so he has a camera on the players .
this is one of the classical expression of play .
if you 're not a player , you might not do some of the <unk> in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something , but also very much , very much concentration , it 's a lot of hard to solve a real hard problem .
when you 're playing , you see some <unk> here , who are <unk> on top of the top and the mouths are a sign of optimism .
this is a player who is on the edge of a <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know this . ok , ok , so we have some player here .
a <unk> victory is a result that has been so very positive that they did n't know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you reach it , they shocked that they 're actually capable of being able to be a <unk> victory .
this player is a short victory .
and this is what we have to see in millions of faces of the world when we take the <unk> of the next century to attack , the face of all odds at the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , let 's look at this face in real life when we face tough problems .
i call it as a `` living in life , '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok ?
this is me how i 'm the `` living in life .
this is a graffiti in my former <unk> home in berkeley , california , in my phd school , in my phd of art are better than in games than in real life .
this is a problem that have many player .
we think we 're not in reality as well .
and i do n't just have less successful , although this is one .
we 're going to get more in <unk> . i mean , in the context of the motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired by collaboration .
when we 're in a <unk> , i think many of us are going to turn us in our best version , anytime , and immediately <unk> , the problem is trying to solve the problem so long as well as long as we need to make it again .
and in the reality , when we fail , if we do it , we 're often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> . we feel threatened , maybe it may be <unk> , maybe it might be frustrated , or <unk> , or <unk> .
and these feelings we never have when we play games , there 's just not just not .
and this is what i wanted to do as a <unk> .
why is it impossible to be impossible to think , you could n't get easy ?
how can we use these emotions into the reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment to the collaborative problem .
and i 've found some things that can make the epic <unk> in <unk> .
so , first , if you put in one of these <unk> , especially of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters who are willing to get to them , and that immediately immediately .
but not just a mission , but a mission , which fits a perfect thing on your level of the game , right ?
so , you create that .
you never get one task that you ca n't solve .
but still the edge of their capabilities , so you have to work , but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you 're not around and simplicity . there 's always a very specific thing to do something important .
and there are tons of workers .
where they go to , hundreds of people who work with them to work with their epic mission .
that 's what we do n't have in the real life , this sense , that it 's a <unk> amount of <unk> .
and also there 's these <unk> story , these inspiring story , why we are there and what we have .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you 've got to be a level of the level , `` <unk> strength '' or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i did n't have a little bit , plus-one speech and plus-one crazy idea , crazy idea .
i do n't get in the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the <unk> like the world of warcraft is that it 's so <unk> , at the edge of a <unk> .
they 're just better than the reality .
until now , all the world of <unk> are <unk> million years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
this is not something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in the context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> began to go to it .
so , the first kind of commitment .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we 're going to spend in play , it 's just to make sense of the time in terms of the scale of human flourishing on the scale of human development .
but also , it 's the same way . because it turns out , because we 're using these whole time in play , in fact that we are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do .
we 're developing each other people .
this is the truth . i think i think .
so , look at these interesting statistic , who recently published a researcher in front of a scientist in the carnegie university , the average boy of a country in a country with a country in a country in a country with <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> to the 21 .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
first of all , for children , in the united states , the <unk> hours of the u.s. , which is the exact <unk> in school , from the five .
so we 've got a complete complete <unk> , on the young people who are learning how to be a good player , how everything else they learn to school .
and maybe some of you have the new book from malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> . ''
so you know his theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours .
she 's based on the great research of <unk> , that if we have 10,000 hours to have a little bit of a subject to the <unk> of a subject to the 21st century , we 'll be <unk> .
we 're going to be so good at what the most important people of the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what are the thing that are <unk> ? ''
because if we could find out that , we would n't have to have a human potential for human potential .
so many people we have in the world , which is at least one hour to spend a day .
these are our <unk> , 500 million people who are extraordinary in `` something . ''
and the next decade we have another billion players , which are extraordinary in whatever .
you know , if you 've never heard it .
the <unk> developed <unk> , which is save the energy and work on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so , the <unk> player 's world , especially in india , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have a whole billion player .
so i started to begin to think what it is to do this games to the way .
so here 's the four things i found . as a first thing .
ok , imagine how a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately , a challenge , with the faith that we have a <unk> hope on success .
and so , the player always believe that a <unk> victory is possible to be possible , and that 's always worth it , and that 's the same .
players are not around .
players are masters in the spiders of the spiders .
there 's a lot of more interesting studies that show us that we like people who are more than we played with them , even if you 've fled the bad thing .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust , to play a game .
and we trust that , someone spends time that the rules of us are going to have the rules that we have the same target and to the <unk> .
so the conversation allows you to grow up with ties , trust and each other .
and as we create a consequence of it , we 're getting stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why there 's a <unk> of <unk> , 22 hours per week , like <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we actually are happier , hard to work , when we do it or nothing .
we know that human beings , we know , we know , we know , we know , if we do hard , great work .
and the players are always willing to work hard , if you get the right job .
and finally , the <unk> is true .
players love to be part of some awe of the missions of <unk> .
here 's a <unk> , to back to the right light , you know all wikipedia , the largest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> of the world , with nearly 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information in the world of warcraft in the internet than about any other subject in each other <unk> of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge of the world of warcraft .
so , these are four superpowers who lead to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
there are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i 'm trying to do .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people have so much time and money in <unk> .
and he says , `` we 're going to be able to be less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and that 's an economist , so he 's logical .
and he says ...
it 's not like i ... i think i 'm playing games , i 'm a little bit more intuitive .
so he says that 's actually making sense , because player can get more in <unk> , and they can get more in a real life .
they can be stronger and more powerful social ties as a real life , and they get more feedback and reward in games as a real life .
so , he says it 's right now , that player will be more time in virtual world than in real world .
i 'm just going to make it , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event , which is six years ago .
there 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> . you know ?
this fantastic fantastic <unk> was <unk> .
and these were the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you 're familiar with the <unk> of the old greek <unk> , you might know that story . the story about how , and why , and why games were invented .
according to <unk> , <unk> , in the kingdom of a famine .
laennec , there was such a great famine that the king of the king decided to be a crazy idea .
people were done . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you took a extreme solution .
so she invented <unk> , loud <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , and they would take a national strategy . you would take food . you would play .
and they would be so much into the <unk> , there 's so fascinating and <unk> , <unk> productivity surrounded that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and on the next day , you would eat .
and according to the <unk> , they survived this famine , by the famine , by the end of a day , and they had a little kid .
likewise , i think , we 're playing games .
we 're playing games to escape the suffering of real world .
we 're playing games to avoid everything in the real world in the real world , all of the lives , and we 're going to get out what we need from the games .
but that does n't have no end .
this is the exciting thing .
according to <unk> , the famine were not much better , so the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a <unk> , and they had to be <unk> to a <unk> adventure .
she <unk> <unk> and made a new home . they were just so many people back how they had food , and they were looking at the rest of the rest in which they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> <unk> , which is later <unk> the <unk> empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so , scientists recently came to the idea that <unk> story are actually wrong .
and , geologists found the evidence of a global cooling , which took almost 20 years , which could explain the famine .
so these crazy story could be true .
you might actually saved her people by play , by using 18 years of games , and then they had this <unk> , and so that 's how much over each other civilization has saved .
so , we can also .
we 're going to play in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we 've been playing with <unk> years .
i 'm telling us , we 're ready for our own personal play .
so , they sent half of their civilization on the search for a new world , so i suppose my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be <unk> that half of us have spent a lesson every day with play , until we have solved the problems of real world .
i know you 'll ask , `` how do we solve problems in games ? '' and right ?
we have this banner in the office in palo alto , it 's going to understand how to understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best result , and then people are doing this idea , which is what we want to do this idea .
we 're going to provide <unk> <unk> and give people the opportunities to reach them .
i 'm going to show you three games that i 've designed to try and try to provide people in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where you have to get over a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it 's realistic , and they 're going to be able to be in real oil , and then they 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
we tested this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we 've got them in the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change because it 's good for the environment , or because we should be .
but when you 're in a <unk> adventure , and they said , `` we 're the oil . ''
this is an amazing adventure to go .
find out how they 're survival . the most of our players have done the game in play habits .
so the next olympics , we have a bigger , higher goal , so that 's higher goal , it 's just as a little bit more .
we have the game called <unk> .
what is a little bit of a <unk> is that the people have only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer called `` global <unk> '' , of course .
the call on players , you have a <unk> , we 've moved to a `` <unk> . ''
you know jerry <unk> , where there is the `` <unk> , '' you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it 's our task to create the future for energy , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players were playing eight weeks .
they found 500 creative solutions that they can read , if they call `` <unk> . ''
and the last game we take on the three . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you leave the game , you get from the world bank , the <unk> of the social <unk> , in 2010 .
we work with universities in the sub-saharan africa , and they 're going to learn a , social entrepreneurs .
we 've got a comic comic book . we 've got a level of the level of understanding , <unk> , sustainability , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
and i want to invite you all , to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in <unk> , which benefit from their own social enterprises to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happened next ?
we have all this fantastic player , we 've got games that show us what we can do , but we have n't going to be a real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that player 's <unk> human resources that we can use to work in real lives , and that games are a big meaning for change .
we 've got these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to provide narrow social nets , <unk> and desire to <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we 're going to play some great games together to survive on this planet .
and i hope you 're going to design me to play and play .
when i put in the next decade , i 'm sure to two things : that we can create any <unk> future , and that we can all play possible games .
so i say , let 's start playing games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you a little bit of telling me a few months ago a article for <unk> .
i 've always write my <unk> <unk> , but i was with the process of the <unk> , and i realized that i was never going to be in my life , which is the word `` disabled ''
i read the post .
`` <unk> '' : `` <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , rich , sensitive .
and i was looking at this list of a friend loud , and i had to look at first laughing , it was so ridiculous , but i was n't going to be <unk> , and they could n't get more <unk> , and i had to stop reading that <unk> <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that a copy has to be a very old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i started building school in school , and to build my point outside of my family sphere , also in terms of other children , and the rest of the world around me .
and so god is not using a <unk> experiment .
if i would have this post seriously , i would have a world like me as a person who would perceive me as a person who can perceive as a person who can be able to run their lives in <unk> , but i 'm going to be in the opportunities for opportunities and adventure and adventure i 've experienced .
so i immediately <unk> up the <unk> of 2009 , and we expect me to find a <unk> contribution .
this is the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it 's not much better .
specifically , the last two words of `` near near <unk> '' is called `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about what we think about people that we think about these words .
it 's about the values that put in these words , and how we build these values .
our language impacts our language and how we see the world and people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the printing force has a big force , because , what you might have loud ,
so what do we want to do , what do we want to do -- a <unk> person or a powerful person ?
just a human being used to call a child , you know , they might have <unk> and <unk> them .
would n't it be nice to open the doors ?
a person who has opened up the doors , my pediatrician was in the <unk> . <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , who ca n't think most americans could n't mean , so he became dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> was always very colorful , and she was just working with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to repeat these <unk> , and i 've got to repeat it , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- and i know that , i hated it . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine i 've even had a <unk> kid with dr. <unk> , and so i tried to stop these exercises , <unk> without success .
and one day he found me at one of my exercises -- these exercises were just italian and <unk> -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're so a strong girl and calf girl , and young girl , you 're going to get one day .
and when you do it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
and that was one of a simple quote from dr. <unk> , so i did n't want to make the exercises that i wanted to get the american <unk> girl in the ward , but he 's actually brought me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes .
and i 'm going to wonder how much his vision of me as a strong and <unk> young girl , and i could imagine a lot of a very strong , and i was looking at a strong , powerful and <unk> person .
this is just one example of many , like adults , in <unk> , the child 's imagination .
but as you 've been quoted examples from the <unk> prove that our language does n't make our language not a place , to imagine something that we would all want to see , to see each individual people .
our language <unk> of the social change , which is in many cases in a technological change .
of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of
so maybe that kind of technological change , because it has always been a different truth , which is that every person can be a very <unk> , and that the human ability to adapt , and the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability -- that 's a interesting story , because it 's a interesting story , because people are always going to tell me about it , and i 'm not going to give you a little bit of proof , and i 've never felt a little bit , and i 've always felt very uncomfortable with me , and i felt very uncomfortable with people from people to answer the questions of people , and i think , and i think , i think that 's what i think
this sentence from odds live in the idea of the idea that success or happiness depends on the idea of a challenge , without being supported by being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
but the truth is that we change us . of course , we are the challenge of the challenge , whether it 's physically , emotionally or even both .
and i 'm telling you that this is good .
dilemma is no obstacle that we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to get better to see better .
odds are easy to our lives .
and i tend to be interested in order to transform against the physical self .
sometimes i realize that he 's very presence , sometimes it 's not to see , but it 's all the time .
and i 'm not going to do n't i 'm not going to do it the impact , or the <unk> of the <unk> of a person .
there are odds in the lives and challenges , and they 're just real , and each person 's going to be different from it . but the question is not , but the question is not , whether we get to odds or not , but not
so we 're not only responsible for the people we love to preserve <unk> , but they 're also going to prepare for it .
and we do n't want our children , if we give them the feeling that you ca n't fit .
you 've got to get two things , you know , you know , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be , to be a medical fact , a <unk> , and to be a social opinion , whether i 'm being disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and disability , with me , with me to get me , is that the world is all always to describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are on the heart , and you know , hard truth to their medical response to the quality of the quality of the quality of life , or even a prediction to the quality of life , we have to have a grave that we do n't have to have the foundation that there is actually disabled .
maybe this is the current concept that 's just going to be a broken , and how we repair the repair , for each one of a greater disability than the conversation in the arts .
if we do n't treat a human being , and not all of their forces and expertise , we 're going to be able to be able to be able to have a level of the natural struggle that you have to have another disease .
we <unk> a person who has a value for society .
so we need to look at the <unk> , and we focus on all the realm of human possibilities .
but most important is that there 's the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , there is a connection .
we should n't get these <unk> times , or historically , we should n't try to avoid them , nor should you go under the carpet , but it 's about the odds of odds .
it may be more about to give you sure that we do n't necessarily overcome frustration , but that we 're open to a motor , to put them to use a <unk> and dance .
and maybe we can make it godless as something natural , selfish and useful models and useful , and they feel so much as <unk> .
in this year , we celebrate 200 of the birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in something very true of human character .
i would make it so this : not the most powerful way of his way , and not the <unk> of his way , but that 's the change in the way to adapt .
it 's the conflict .
not only from darwin , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , from the fight from human spirit , to turn themselves .
so again , change and destruction are the great person of people .
and maybe we just know , from what wood we 're <unk> , if we 're really excited .
maybe that 's the sense of odds , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can imagine something like itself .
we can not innovate a new meaning that 's beyond hard times .
maybe we can be adversities as change .
innovate for a change that we have not adapted .
i think the biggest damage we have to have to have the opportunity is to believe that we should be normal .
i mean , who is normal ?
there is no normal thing .
the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would be the normal . and would you want these poor , gray person to learn if it could really have really ?
i do n't think it 's not .
it would be great , if we find this paradigm of normal versus the strength or the strength , to make it a little bit dangerous , and so we can release the forces of a lot of kids , and they invite them to be a very special and precious capabilities in society .
now , <unk> found that we have people from the members of our society , and have a <unk> , useful and create a contribution .
now , there 's been evidence that 's the americans ago , 60,000 years ago , and people with <unk> physical injury , and maybe that would happen in the people that would be precious to society .
they did n't look at these people as being broken and useless , they were treated as something special and precious .
one couple of years ago , i was in the city i grew up in a `` <unk> , in the northeast zone in pennsylvania , and i was a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear how a guy behind me , `` well , if this is not a <unk> . ''
and i call myself around and see the older man . i did n't know who he 's .
and i 'd say , `` excuse me , sir , you know ? i ca n't remember them . ''
and he said , `` well , you ca n't remember me .
when i first saw her , i got out of your mother . ''
oh , so .
and then , it 's made it , but of course , it did .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i had from stories of my mother over this day , because of course , of my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew my man who brought me to the world , not .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet of her , and i only had a couple of toes on the other foot , this stranger had to be wrong .
he said to me , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say , `` i had to say that you could never run , and never would be so much like the other people who could never live a <unk> life , and you 've just got me just lying . ''
so really extraordinary , i found that he had <unk> my whole childhood , whether i had a <unk> in the second grade , whether i had my fellowship at the <unk> , whether i had my fellowship at the <unk> , whether i had my fellowship at the <unk> of the <unk> or one of my favorite <unk> <unk> , and he used this clips to teach his students , <unk> in the <unk> medical school , and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> factor , the potential of the human being .
you ca n't seem to stress how crucial of this factor can be for the quality of living .
and dr. <unk> told , he said , `` i 've learned that kids , if you 're not going to say anything else , if you 're only going to get a little support , if you get kids , if you 're going to get a little bit of support , when you get kids , then kids can have a lot of
you see , dr. <unk> has been changed .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how anyone were doing with it , two different things are .
and i have changed my thinking in the course of time , if you had asked me in the age of 15 years , whether i had my prostheses from flesh and bone , i would n't have a second .
i wanted to be normal way to be normal .
if you ask me tonight , i 'm not so safe .
and that 's happened because i had something with my legs , and not even in this experiences .
and maybe that change could also happen , because i 've lived so many people who have open doors , rather than one of people who were looking for me , to me or me to be a idea .
you see , it 's really just a person who 's just showing you a person who can show you how they can make their forces , and they are .
if you can allow somebody to activate its own forces -- the human spirit is so versatile -- if you can make it , and for someone in a critical moment , you 're opening up to these people , then they 're a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word `` <unk> '' in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means something that is that in a one , that 's the potential .
again , what potential is we want to look at this ?
in the '60s , in britain , in britain , it was done in <unk> .
they call this `` <unk> <unk> '' in the united states , we call the `` <unk> . ''
the students are <unk> .
and the a students are <unk> <unk> , the better teacher , etc .
and they 've got a <unk> period of students with a wonderful period of <unk> , and it was told you , they were told you , they were <unk> , and they were very smart , and after these three months , you had written
and of course , there 's a heart attack from listening to the heart of the <unk> , they 're just enough .
and then it was also the three months .
but only the ones who are still in school , except by the students who had been <unk> school .
the crucial thing about this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
you just said that the student was being a student , and they 're the students with the note , and they have been taught them and they 're being taught them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind , the broken mind , broken mind , and he does n't find more . he does n't find a little bit more . he does n't know our natural , difficult curiosity . and our innate ability to imagination .
but if we create it , to support the human spirit of being alive and hoping to find themselves and other people to be beautiful , and then we 're going to be able to be able to be able to make our forces really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i 'd like to end with a poem , which is a <unk> poet named <unk> in the 14 century , and the poem is called `` the god , '' and that 's the god knows , `` the god , '' not the god of the <unk> , but the god knows , he 's just
come , dance . thank you .
