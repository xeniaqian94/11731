when steve lopez , new york times , a day of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came out of a man , a african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , who had a violin who had two strings .
many of you will know the story of the story , because of <unk> papers later , again , with robert <unk> , as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> as steve <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , and whose <unk> career has been <unk> through his <unk> adolescence .
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> and 30 years later , later , he lived in the streets of <unk> row in los angeles .
i 'm going to keep you all the way to read , <unk> book , or to read the film , so they do n't just understand the wonderful connection that work between these two men , but what the music has helped this connection , and how they were able to make this instrument , when it was to get this instrument , the <unk> of the <unk>
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he just had a map of <unk> and <unk> symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking in a very <unk> and <unk> sound of yo-yo ma , and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never get into the baseball series of series , and this is all of the first violin for the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
we came to talk to talk to music , and a few days later , i got a email in the state that <unk> was interested in me .
i have to mention <unk> that <unk> a medical treatment , because it has been treated with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has been his whole life .
now , as a result , he 's particularly prone to these <unk> <unk> , and they are so bad , and he <unk> days in the streets of <unk> row , always this <unk> and the <unk> of his mind .
and in exactly a <unk> , <unk> , when we started with the first class in walt <unk> , <unk> hall , and he had this <unk> flickering in his eyes and was lost .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and someone wanted to poison in the sleep .
i was scared , not the network , but i was frightened that i could lose it that he could lose him into one of his conditions , and that i could go to <unk> his relationship with <unk> and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk>
so i just started playing on .
i played the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and when i played , i fell in <unk> eyes was a full change .
it was when he stood under the influence of a invisible medicine , a chemical reaction , that was a catalyst for a game .
<unk> <unk> form in understanding into a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and as a miracle he took his violin and started to play some clips of <unk> , and then asked me to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started talking about music , starting from the stream of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he did n't have a <unk> about music , but with her close personal relationship .
he was talking about her passion and a understanding that i just know about my colleagues at the <unk> of los angeles .
because he was playing music and talked about music , was from this <unk> , <unk> man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for <unk> , music means health .
because the music allows him to be the thought of the thoughts and terror with his imagination and creativity in something that 's true .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that the nature of art is .
this is the reason why we make music : we have something that exists deep inside our inner lens through our artistic animation through our creativity .
and the reality of this tells us all of us all of us , and it 's inspired by us .
what <unk> <unk> , the music came back into a community of friends .
the <unk> of music brought him back in a family of musicians that mind his own talent and <unk> it back .
and i 'm always going to get with <unk> music , whether in walt disney hall , or in <unk> <unk> , because he remembered why i 've become musicians .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have stolen the <unk> <unk> .
i hope i hope me .
so i 've known many fish .
i just loved two .
this first , this was more like a passionate about .
it was a nice fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a book on the menu .
what 's a fish .
even better , he was <unk> in <unk> <unk> of sustainability .
so you could feel that you can feel like to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
one day , the head of the company called the head of the company and asked if i could be in a event that could be the sustainability of farm .
`` of course , '' i said .
here 's a company that was trying to solve what this incredible problem is , how do we keep fish on our <unk> ?
in the past 50 years , we have <unk> the oceans like we have <unk> forests .
it 's hard to <unk> the destruction .
ninety percent of the big fish that we love , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so , it 's going to be or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments about it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them , and they 're inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are required to get a pounds of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
not very good .
so here 's one company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
at the day , i called the head of the <unk> of the company in the company .
let 's give him clear .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` only just about the facts are right , you 're famous for the ocean that you do n't have an environmental environment . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far outside that the trash of our fish is being distributed . ''
and then he added on , `` we 're basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> , '' what 's your mind ? ''
`` sustainable proteins '' he said .
`` great '' i said .
and i was in bed , i was in bed , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the process of time .
i said , `` well , what are the sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he did n't know that . he 's going to do the answer .
now , i <unk> with a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a boatload answer , and i finally finally <unk> with <unk> biologists .
let 's give him clear .
`` <unk> , '' i said , `` what are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , `` <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . ''
i said , `` how much percent of your own business is chicken ? ''
we may have two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what is sustainable to feed chicken ? ''
there was a long break , and he said , `` there 's just too much chicken on the world . ''
i <unk> this fish .
no , not because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that 's me .
no , i actually have <unk> in this fish , because i swear to chicken , the fish after this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , that 's another kind of <unk> .
it 's the romantic kind of romantic , which you know , the better you know , you know , you know , you love the fish .
i first ate him in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist , had been talking about this fish .
she has a kind of <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost <unk> blue .
the chef had <unk> him .
twice .
astonishingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste a fish so good after he became <unk> ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
we call him miguel . actually , <unk> .
and no , he does n't have a fish and he 's not a chef . at least the way that you and i understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corners .
it 's close to the river of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they were growing up on what 's basically wetlands .
they made it by <unk> the country .
they built these complicated consequences of channels , and they were <unk> water out of the land , and beyond the river .
well , they could n't do that that worked , not economically .
and green was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did you do ?
they have the river of water .
they literally <unk> the lever .
instead of <unk> the water , they used the channels to <unk> the water again .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a republican cotton <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- <unk> and his company completely completely <unk> the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this .
they look at the horizon , the one million miles away , and all you see are <unk> channels and these <unk> , <unk> .
i was n't a long time there with miguel .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles and a part of the <unk> .
okay ? there we were and fought us through the wetlands , and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knee , and miguel holding into peace in peace .
here he picks up a rare <unk> .
now he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and this is the pattern of <unk> reminded of the <unk> .
it turns out that miguel the biggest part of his career has spent in the <unk> national park .
i asked him as a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish .
i 'm a expert in relations . ''
and then he 's going to go to the <unk> of rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and i do n't understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was love .
and my head became weak about that <unk> piece of <unk> fish i had at the <unk> .
so i was struck him . i said , `` miguel , how come your fish so good ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , phytoplankton , the relationships that is incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
well , he 's going to tell me that it 's like a <unk> system that the fish eat what they eat in the wild .
the applause biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's totally <unk> .
there is no food .
the one of the farm is that not <unk> their animals ?
and later , i went on that site , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , which seems to be like that , which seems like every farm , which i 've ever been , `` how does it be success ? ''
in the moment , it was like a <unk> cap of <unk> .
and we had a bow to the corner and offered the most incredible time , thousands and thousands of thousands and thousands of thousands , a literally <unk> <unk> .
`` this is success , '' he said .
`` look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> do n't your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> .
now , last year , this is 18 birds , more than 250 different types .
this is the world today , and one of the most important private private rainforest has become in all europe .
i said , miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> that you want to have on a <unk> pot ? ''
he <unk> his head , no .
he said , `` we 'll build <unk> , not terrible .
this is a <unk> network .
they eat the mantis shrimp .
the shrimp are eating phytoplankton .
so the <unk> of the head the <unk> the system . ''
okay , let 's think about the model . a farm that ca n't feed your animals and a farm that measures your success of your predators .
a <unk> , but a <unk> .
well , and by the way , this flamingos , i should n't even be there .
they breed in a city <unk> where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
each morning , they fly <unk> miles to <unk> .
and they fly through <unk> miles .
they make it because they can follow the white white line of the <unk> <unk> .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , `` miguel , fly <unk> miles to the farm , flying <unk> miles back ?
do this for the children ? ''
he looked at me when i had a song in the whitney of houston .
he said , `` no . they do that , because the food is better . ''
i did n't mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i do n't like any <unk> . i do n't like them . i do n't know them .
it 's this <unk> taste , <unk> taste .
i will never leave it almost .
and yet , when i try to cross it in <unk> , she did n't have <unk> at <unk> .
they <unk> sweet and pure , as if you would take a bites of the ocean .
i mentioned miguel and he <unk> .
he said , `` the skin works like a sponge .
she 's the last resistance to turn into the body .
she has evolved in evolution to make <unk> <unk> . ''
and then he said , `` but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . one farm , a farm that ca n't feed your fish , a farm that measures its success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no <unk> , he <unk> a huge amount because the water does come through this farm from the river in the river .
it 's a river that leads all the things that rivers are , they tend to lead them with chemical pollutants , <unk> by <unk> .
and if it 's fighting by the system , and this leaves is open , water is clean , when it 's <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that does n't feed their animals , not just a farm that 's going to measure your success of your account , but a farm , the farm is literally a <unk> , and not just for those fish , but for me .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i think they should do that , because these <unk> , which is always <unk> .
you could say that you 're a recipe for the future of the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
now , what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , which is actually <unk> .
but for many people , this is a little bit to radical .
we 're not <unk> . we 're <unk> . we are lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we 're talking about regional food .
and if you say that the things that is the future of the future of food , someone says , `` hey people , i love the pink flamingos , but how will they feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we are producing enough calories to feed the world more than feeding .
one billion people will be killing today .
one billion -- that 's more than ever -- because of <unk> disparities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i do n't like this question , because it 's the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years .
<unk> grain on <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> on earth , chemicals on earth , and the whole time has been simply <unk> , `` when we are spending more people cheaper as well , ''
this was the <unk> . it was the <unk> . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
so we should call them what it is , a system of <unk> , a system that spider <unk> <unk> , which is the exactly the production .
this is not a system , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is under threat today not because of <unk> , but <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> land , not by pump , not by <unk> water , not by <unk> and nets , but by fish , but through fish .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we make conditions allow each community to feed itself ?
to do this , not look at the <unk> of the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are , and it 's never produced good for the food .
instead , instead of the ecological model .
this is that on two billion years of <unk> .
look , miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not going to be the worlds of business , businesses , business institutions , businesses , businesses , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , rather than <unk> , farmers , but experts are <unk> .
because they are the ones who are the experts for taste .
and if i 'm honest , you 're a better chef when i ever be .
you know , that 's right , because if the future is good , it 's delicious .
thank you .
if i want to talk to you today is that the full of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of your pieces , and instead of thinking that they can think about it as we can use information , and we see things that would be <unk>
so what we 're looking at is a typical case of old <unk> .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter to a certain cause , say , accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that creates .
and it 's because of the <unk> islands , on the <unk> , and they are on the <unk> .
we can go out , and we can go back and see the data and see that <unk> and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , when we go on , and after age , we say 40 years , or we want to see that crashes even have the cause people have to worry about .
and who 's going to see that this is true of men .
so you can see that this is the view of information and data in this way of swimming in a living in a living system .
and if we can do this for raw data , why do n't it for content ?
so what we have here are the <unk> of every one of the individual <unk> that have ever been printed in print .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
you can like to test it into my talk to the talk .
with <unk> , you can jump into a decade .
you can jump into a particular year .
you can jump on a certain kind of copy .
so when i look at here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the sports .
i 'm an unfortunate armstrong fan , so i 'm going to click on the way to me all expenses already .
now , if i want to make a <unk> view , i could think , `` okay , what if i 'm going to look at me with me . ''
so i go back to a step back and <unk> the way .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a idea that if you put this kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you 're not just looking for .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it 's something between , and we 're changing the way that information is used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit about what a little bit crazy .
what we 've done is , we took each individual <unk> , and they <unk> on a little summary .
the <unk> contains a quick and a symbol of the area that you get .
i just just show the top 500 of the <unk> <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a impression about the issues that are about wikipedia .
now , i 'm going to choose the topic of <unk> .
now after i 've been <unk> , i know , the <unk> of the people who are <unk> in time , `` humans of the year . ''
this is really important because this is a insight that is not in a single <unk> .
this is just when you look at one step back and look at all .
<unk> on a particular one of this <unk> , i can then go back in the topic of time `` humans '' and look at all together .
now , when i look at all these people , the majority of these people are <unk> , some of the science . some of them are less , coming out of the economy . here 's my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , a ted prize winner .
so we can go to <unk> the ted prize .
you 're looking at the first time in the web as though it 's a net , not just page , but more <unk> .
and so i want to show you what else might be a little surprise .
i just 'll show you the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i want to call it a browser ; it 's really no browser , but you can look like websites -- and we get these <unk> to each one .
so i can go back to a step , and look at a specific <unk> <unk> .
that 's why because you just look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look of websites that can look at the same way around the same way .
so i can zoom in a certain kind of <unk> .
here 's the first demonstration that i have been going to go back to this .
and i can look at all of what i 've been looking at today , again .
and when i go back a step back , and i look at all of all , i may have my new process of my <unk> , and here i was looking for <unk> , and this is going to bing , or here for live labs .
and here i can go into the page and put them back .
it 's a metaphor that 's already used again , and every time it makes a shot bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
right , in this world , we think that data is curse .
we talk about the curse of the <unk> .
we 're talking about `` <unk> in information . ''
what if we could turn these situation , and the internet on the head is that instead of going to go from a lot of things , and see patterns that would be stuck in .
if we can do this , this takes place , maybe a new source of information .
and instead of being just going to move in information , we can know that .
and when we know , maybe we can even pull the wisdom of it .
so i hear that thanks very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my school , i went with the bus to school every hour .
and my nose got involved in a book , a <unk> , which is <unk> in other worlds , and <unk> me to <unk> and <unk> curiosity .
and that curiosity also showed me that i was always in school , when i was the forests of the forests , and `` samples and <unk> , frogs and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , all after the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limitations .
and my love to science fiction seemed in my environment , because back in the late '60s , we flew the moon and exploring the deep deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that are animals and places and places that we had never been able to have imagined .
this is pretty good at that <unk> <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw draw . i could paint painting .
and there 's a lot of video games nor video games with <unk> imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
so , we had to all the time when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> them on the screen in our <unk> .
so my response is the drawing and paint from aliens , alien worlds , robots , the <unk> and all that .
in the math , i was always caught by the teachers , the <unk> , <unk> .
the creativity had to go out .
and what happened was something interesting : what was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows that was completely unknown world here on our earth .
now i would never would never get a alien world with a spaceship . that seemed quite unlikely .
but here 's a world that i could actually go in the earth , and she was just as amazing and exotic as i was able to just read this books .
so i decided i was 15 , <unk> .
the only problem is that i lived in canada , a thousand miles away from the next ocean .
but i did n't let me <unk> .
i <unk> my father , until he finally had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , in the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in <unk> , new york .
but the ocean , a real oceans , i got two years later , when we moved to california .
and since the 40 years , over 40 years , i 've spent about 6,000 hours below water , 500 hours of that in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the coastal oceans , so rich as we can actually hardly imagine .
the idea of nature does n't know , in contrast to our own , <unk> human imagination .
so for the time i 'm thinking about the day days , i feel popular awe for what i see on my <unk> .
and my love for the ocean continues to rise to the same intensity as well as well .
when i <unk> a profession , it was the <unk> .
that seemed the best way of telling me to tell stories with my need to create images .
as a child , i had constantly <unk> and so forth .
so , films were the way of the way , pictures , and stories were together .
of course , the stories i was <unk> , `` <unk> , '' `` <unk> , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> , i could connect my preference for the <unk> and diving the <unk> .
so green are my two passions .
something interesting happened at `` <unk> '' : to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of sense of liquid <unk> , <unk> animation , <unk>
what happens is that was the first <unk> <unk> that was ever in a movie .
so the film did n't have a money , he 's actually <unk> his <unk> , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience was like the magic of the magic of this
arthur robert clarke 's law is known to distinguish <unk> technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that has got to be involved in the <unk> . ''
so we went to `` terminator 2 , '' my next film , still much more on .
together , with <unk> buildings , we created the guy from liquid metal . the success was off of how this effect would come to .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the impact in the audience was the same . but we have a little more money .
from these two experiences , a very new world has reached a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , with my good friend <unk> <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> . she was `` digital <unk> . ''
the idea of this company was that the phase of <unk> processes with <unk> <unk> , and to start with the same with digital <unk> .
and so that 's what we did , and that 's what we 're doing is that we were looking for a market condition .
but in the middle of the early years , we realized that we had in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we had the company -- to start <unk> .
i had this piece called `` avatar , '' the bar of visual effects and <unk> effects should be <unk> with the realistic human , expressive characters , and the <unk> should be all the <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar went back , and the people in my company told me that we are not able to do that .
so , i go to the same time , and i made this other film about the big ship , and it goes down .
the <unk> , i sold this `` romeo and julia to a ship . it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate film .
but i really wanted to <unk> the real train the titanic .
that 's why i made the film .
this is the truth . the studio did n't .
but i convinced me , i said , `` we come to the train . we call the real train .
we 're going to show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> them to finance a expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that , that your imagination can create a reality .
in fact , we created a reality of six months later in which i went into a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and the real titanic <unk> through a <unk> .
this was not a movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , this really struck me .
and this is really enormous . we had to build cameras and <unk> and everything .
and i fell , like this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you ascend into this capsule , you 're going down into the dark , hostile environment , where not hope is going to make it back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as i was in a <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep ocean .
anyway , from the part of curiosity and science , it 's all . it was <unk> , it was imagination .
and there was a experience that i could n't give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a nature of the visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
in some of the following us , i 've seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , even things that had no one before , and for the science for the science , when we saw them , i had no words .
so this is really <unk> , and i wanted more .
and so i met a certain unusual decision .
after the success of the success , i said , `` okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood and <unk> for a while . ''
and then we started to the <unk> , and they went to <unk> them with <unk> .
we went back to the train <unk> .
we took little robots that we had built a <unk> <unk> .
our purpose was to look at <unk> and look at the inside of the ship .
nobody ever had the head of the <unk> , and i did n't have any cure for that . so we developed the technology .
and there i 'm now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see that <unk> , which is quite similar , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> of the sidewalk off .
i actually <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the <unk> .
it felt like i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i 've experienced , because before i took a corner , i already knew what was going on in the <unk> of the <unk> institute , because i walked months of <unk> <unk>
and that was a complete copy of the ship of the ship .
so this was a highly strange experience .
she made me this kind of <unk> that you can use such <unk> and so much your own consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
this was really extremely profound .
and maybe a little view of what may be going to happen in some decades , if you 've got to study some things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine .
so after these led , we started to learn what we 've really appreciate , for example , where we saw these incredibly surprising animals . that 's kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with the help of <unk> .
they do n't exist in the sun , the way we do .
and so you can see animals that will be right next to a 500 level that they can survive .
at the same time , i also became very obsessed with <unk> , that was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up in the people who are interested in the space , and they 're going to do with nasa , and they 're going to do right now , and they drive to russia , looking at the mission of the <unk> of all of them , and go to the international <unk>
this was amazing .
but at the end of the end , it was that i took me on the deep ocean .
i took them access to the world to the world , <unk> , <unk> , people who had been interested in such extreme situations . i took them around , so they could go around and test instruments and so forth .
we were <unk> , and actually science , actually , <unk> , <unk> .
this is the circle between my existence as a <unk> , then as a child , and the connection is in reality .
in the course of these <unk> , i 've learned a lot .
i 've learned a lot about science . but i think i think you have to think a director has to lead a director , a leader is a leader , or like .
but i do n't mind much of leadership before i <unk> that .
because of a particular point , i said , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? ''
the stinking movies do n't make money .
we 're going to play the <unk> . it 's not a <unk> .
everybody thinks i would be between `` titanic '' and `` avatar '' and would have caught the <unk> on a towel on the beach .
i have all these films , these <unk> , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you 're going to do the challenge to the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that you are . you 're making it , and because of the weird connection that comes when a little group of people play a team .
because we 've done all this with only 10 to 12 , the years of years ago , sometimes we were two to three months in lake .
and in this community , you realize the most important thing that you have thought that you have a difference that you ca n't explain .
if you go to land and say , `` we had to do it , the <unk> , and the amount of things , '' you ca n't explain the other <unk> , and that 's like `` the other people , '' and in the other people , or with the women , and in the women , you can never come back to
there is a connection that creates respect respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film , i tried to apply the same leadership role , which is that you <unk> his team and <unk> your respect .
that became the dynamics really changed .
so , i stood again with a little team on a <unk> area , and we turned it `` avatar . ''
it 's terribly exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we became a period of four years to a big family .
and it changed my way to make movies completely .
there were people who said we would have gotten this <unk> <unk> , and it 's actually <unk> on the planet .
for me , it was more a more <unk> way to do the job that changed the outcome .
so what can we close to all this ?
what are we learned ?
i think the <unk> is the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a power that can actually create a reality .
and the thought of your team is more important than all the <unk> of this world .
to me , the young filmmaker , who say , `` give me a advice that i can do . ''
and i say , `` do n't you do yourself .
that 's going to get others for you . do n't give you yourself , bet not for yourself .
nasa has this <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study of the art , it does n't have to be an alternative , because there will be a <unk> problem .
no important endeavor , the innovation was ever dealt with risk .
you have to be willing to take the risks .
this is the thought that i 'd like to give you to the path , it 's not a alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
today i 'm talking about energy and climate .
and that 's surprising , because what 's surprising is because my <unk> of the foundation are mainly about vaccines that are available to vaccines and seed to allow the things we have to invent and have to make the poorest two billion of life .
but energy and climate is extremely important for these people , just even more important than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> is not going to grow over many years , and we 're going to be too much better , and things are going to change how to change your <unk> environments .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
so , will a climate matter of them .
also , the <unk> of them is very important .
the fact is that if you could reduce the price of the price to the cost of the most effective most effective .
well , the <unk> is about time .
in fact , the <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> , the industrial revolution in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the 20th century , and that 's why we have guilty , <unk> <unk> , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation in the rich world .
but if we 're going to reduce the price -- let 's make the price -- we make a new barrier and these barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warms up the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually clear .
they <unk> the source of co2 , which will lead to the <unk> , and the effects of the weather on the weather and perhaps worse , which is the kind of thing that the natural ecosystems , that the natural ecosystems ca n't adapt to adapt and <unk>
now , the same connection between a <unk> , and the process of <unk> and the other follow , there are some <unk> , but not very many .
and there are certain <unk> about how bad these consequences will . but they 're extremely bad .
i asked the <unk> times , `` i really have to get down to zero ?
does n't have half or a neighborhood ? ''
the answer is : until we get to zero , the temperature will continue .
that 's why it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than saying that we have a 3.5 <unk> truck under one three meters of bridge , and that can be able to be <unk> underneath .
this must be in the bottom , on zero .
now , we poke a lot of <unk> from 26 billion tons .
everybody americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
the average is about five tons for every planet .
and somehow , we need to produce changes that are reduced to zero .
it 's been <unk> across .
only different economic changes have been influenced by the same and we have to go to <unk> increase and <unk> to zero .
and this equation has four factors . they have a little bit of <unk> . they have the amount of links that you want to get to zero , and that 's going to be used by the number of people , the average energy in the average , the average energy for the average , and the average of the average , the average energy for each service and the co2 that will be <unk> .
so let 's look at each factor of one factor , we think we get to zero .
it 's probably a very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but we 'll go through this .
first , we have the population .
today 's seven billion people .
and it 's looking at nine billion to move nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> are , we could reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but we see the slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this is all the food that we eat , clothing , heating .
that 's very good things , and <unk> means to make these services accessible to every planet .
it 's great that this number is rising .
in the rich world , the upper billion , we might be able to make a <unk> and less use , but in average , this number is going to rise every year , and thus double the numbers of the services to develop a person .
here we look at a very fundamental service . there 's light light to read the homework ?
and students do n't have it , so they go out and read your <unk> under the <unk> .
well , in efficiency , e , the energy per service , there is good news .
we have something that does n't go up .
because of a different successes of the <unk> , through other <unk> , through new services , there are a lot of services , their energy will reduce 90 percent .
in others , as the manufacturing process of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , is very much smaller .
in the whole , if we 're optimistic , we may get a reduction in order to get a factor for three or perhaps a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we are now from 26 billion of perhaps <unk> 13 tons . and that 's not enough .
so let 's see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a <unk> -- that 's the amount of co2 that will be <unk> .
the question is that you can get to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every <unk> of the electricity today , co2 today , except renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do is to create a new system .
we need collusion .
if i do , i do n't have the impossible .
<unk> is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
and the people who contributed to many of these miracles .
usually there is not a miracle that you need to need a miracle to a date .
you 're just going to look at the end and some of you , others .
in this case , we have to have <unk> and a miracle in very short time .
well , i wondered , how can i really <unk> this ?
is there a natural gas mask , a demonstration of people on the idea of people here ?
i remembered the last year when i got mosquitos and liked the people .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know that people living with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell here .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be in the environment of the environment .
so here 's a few natural fireflies .
you have told me that you ca n't bite you . actually you wo n't leave the glass of the glass .
well , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they do n't all get a lot .
we need the solutions , either either the one people have a huge scaling and incredible <unk> , and even though there are many directions , i 'm just looking at just five , which can do this big needs .
i have poison , <unk> , fusion and <unk> .
and this may have a moderate contribution and if you get better than i expect , but my name is that we have to be in all of those five work , and we ca n't give you from them because they have <unk>
let 's look at the burn of fossil fuels , the <unk> of the coal or natural gas .
what you have to do , it seems easy , but it 's not it . you 'd have to have all the co2 coming out of the <unk> , <unk> pressure , and then you have and hope that it stays there .
there 's a few <unk> , which is on 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it 's going to get a big difficult thing to produce a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the <unk>
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times bigger than any kind of junk you can imagine with <unk> and others ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a hard <unk> .
next : <unk> .
that 's also three big issues , the cost of the cost , all in <unk> countries , and the question that you really feel like that you can really feel bad , despite the human cooperation that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
and even though he 's not very big , there 's a lot of attention .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that 's why to work .
the last three three of the five <unk> i went on .
they are the renewables as they 're going to be called <unk> .
and even though , it 's great is that they have no fuel -- they have some downsides .
one is the <unk> that these technologies get dramatically dramatically than the <unk> of <unk> .
these are <unk> , you talk about many <unk> , 1,000 times more area than a normal power station .
and this <unk> <unk> .
the sun does n't seem to be a whole day , it 's not all day , and as the same <unk> is not all the wind .
and therefore , if you have to depend on these vent species , a way to get the energy in times when they 're not available .
so there 's big <unk> . there 's challenges on the transmission . if we say , if we 're going to say that the energy source is outside of the country , you do n't need to do the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy is from
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i 've got all kinds of batteries , which are made , for cars , cell phones , <unk> , and that 's what i use to the amount of energy , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , compared to the world , and i found that all the
so we need a big breakthrough , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches of time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
and this is what happens when you 're trying to get these hydrothermal vents about you , we have 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to have 100 percent of that , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
manhattan project ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is many companies that are working on .
in each of these five areas we need 100 people .
you 're going to say , you 're crazy . this is good .
i think here in ted group there are many , who are already involved in .
bill has a number of companies , which one called <unk> has the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies doing great things and have interesting opportunities and i try to support that .
nathan <unk> , and i have to fund a company that , may surprise the nuclear approach .
there are some innovation in <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has stopped a time , so it 's not a big surprise that some good concepts cholera around .
the <unk> principle is that instead of a part of the <unk> , which is a percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent of the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you thought about this for a long time , but you could never be able to predict whether it would work , but since the modern supercomputer , you can see , yes , it 's like the right <unk> .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it 's a lot better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the trash of the waste of today than <unk> .
instead of <unk> the head , you just burn it . a great thing .
so the uranium is used to use a little bit like a candle .
you can see it 's a kind of <unk> , often as `` <unk> wave . ''
it really does n't solve this .
here 's a picture of the place in kentucky .
this is the waste that 's 99 percent . you have the part of which is called <unk> <unk> .
the data for hundreds of years .
and if you get inexpensive and simple , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's a example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get ahead .
let 's start to measure our success .
what should we look at ?
well , let 's go to the goal we have to do , and we talk about the <unk> .
a lot of talk about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it 's really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be generated in poor countries , and they still have a little farming , and hopefully it will be <unk> and cement .
so , to get that 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely .
the other note says that we 're used to use the <unk> technology in all developed countries , and we 're on the way to get them to the rest .
that 's great important .
this is going to be a key part of this .
when we go out there , what 's going to look at 2020 ?
it had the two elements again .
we should be able to use the <unk> to get reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing reducing the way to the way , the less and less we <unk> , the less <unk> will be the <unk> and <unk> the temperature .
but in fact , this note of the things that we 're going to do is build the big <unk> , just in the same way , or even a matter , or even something less important as the other ones that are the <unk> of innovation .
this breakthroughs to pursue technology , and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this topic .
al gore `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> <unk> the <unk> air .
they really go through and create a framework that can be discussed , because we need support of all sides .
there 's a few people to come together .
that 's a wish .
a very <unk> that we invent this technology .
if you just allow me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a <unk> , and i could choose the wish , or i could choose this wish , <unk> <unk> ,
this is the biggest impact .
if we do n't get this wish , the dig between the <unk> between the long and <unk> are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich countries , and nearly all of these two billion will be very much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what are i doing ?
we have to use this for more <unk> .
if countries in places like <unk> , you should n't just talk about co2 .
they should let me talk to this <unk> , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous money that 's spent for this innovative approaches .
we need <unk> , we need co2 , water supply , trade food , trade buildings .
we have to spread the message .
we have to make a dialogue <unk> and <unk> , and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it 's an important wish , but i think we can meet him .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , you can give us a notion of scale of that investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , we have to get all the big scientist , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we put our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it works in the <unk> of the
the difficult step is the first <unk> , to find another billion , the <unk> and the place of the first of that .
once the first finished , if he can go like that , everything is all clear , because the economy , the economy is so different as we know them .
so to understand the right : this means deep in the ground is a vertical column of nuclear <unk> , that used to be <unk> and then the process starts to work on the bottom ?
bg : exactly . now , you have to be new to the reactor , so there 's lots of people , so many people , and many of the controls , and many of the controls , and many of the controls , and many of the controls , which is going to go wrong , and this thing you 're going to go wrong and get things .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can turn it for 60 years -- think of a <unk> -- which is <unk> , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's there and <unk> 60 years , and it 's done .
a <unk> , the self is a solution to the trash .
bg : well , well , well , what happens to the trash : you can sit there -- there is much less junk with this technology -- you take it and put it in the next reactor and <unk> it .
and we start by taking the junk that already exists in these <unk> or <unk> in the reactors .
so this is what you 're going to do is a problem , which is what we 're going to fill in our fill and get the <unk> impact during this process .
but while they 've talked about these world about these kinds of opportunities .
where is the biggest interest in which really do ?
bg : now we have n't invented a place , and there 's a lot of more interesting <unk> for all the names , and there 's big interest in russia , india , china , china , and i have met the minister and talk about how this is
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese did something .
this is a nuance of one thing that has been done .
this is a big step ahead , but it 's like a faster and some of the countries have built this building , so everyone that has done a very fast thing for our first .
in her idea : <unk> and probability really is being into life ?
bg : now we need one of those <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to use 20 years .
that 's kind of the <unk> that we have demonstrated the <unk> that we have to do .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything goes all right , and this is a big wish that could easily be easily .
and luckily , there 's dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , the same thing that work that works for your pilot for your pilot .
and it would be the best if it can produce several , because you could use a mixture of it .
in fact , we need a solution .
what the big breakthroughs , is this the biggest you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the <unk> .
that would be without the <unk> , but it 's even more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we do n't know their work like this , but there 's the <unk> approach that 's another approach .
there 's a liquid molecule that seems something difficult , but maybe the one that will tell us .
and so there 's different , but the nice thing is , but the beauty is that a million times a million times as much energy , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems that are the radiation , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact , the impact on the country , so the impact on the country , so the impact on the country , so the impact on the country , so the impact on the country , so the impact on the country , so the impact on the country , so the impact on the country , and the impact on the country ,
if that does n't work what ?
we have to be <unk> to be <unk> to try to keep the <unk> stable stable ?
bg : if you get in this situation , it 's when you have a lot of heart attack , and what you do ? you might need a <unk> or like this .
there 's a <unk> that is called <unk> , which is happening with different techniques to get global warming , so we get 20 or 30 years back to us .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we do n't need that .
some people say , you should n't really work on insurance because you 're going to do a fake , so you keep going to eat because you know that you 're going to save a <unk> .
i do n't know if you 're smart , if you 're going to be the importance of this problem , but it 's now a discourse in <unk> , whether you have to have the things that are going to get faster , or those innovation needs more than we expect .
<unk> : have you have two games for the way you might have to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the scientific arguments , are very little .
say that there are negative effects that move things around ?
there are very , very few things that you can say at all of that one .
the <unk> here is like about aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay very much later .
and so the idea is now , now , if you have all kinds of <unk> issues , you know , what 's going to be -- and this is that the investment is not so clear that the investment is not so clear , and there are people who do n't necessarily think about the rich world , and say , `` okay , this is not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty is to worry .
but my dream here is , if you can do the co2 , and the skeptics say , `` okay , `` okay , `` okay , `` okay , `` okay , i do n't know that it does n't matter that it 's not a co2 , i would do it , but i will accept because it 's cheaper than the previous way . ''
and that would be the answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all of these time and energy use the co2 to solve the co2 , all the other goals of malaria , the <unk> of malaria , and so forth that it 's a dumb waste of resources , to invest money that we can do .
bg : well , the actual profits for research -- say the u.s. u.s. per year than you do -- that 's not so dramatic .
there 's no other things to be suffering .
you get to a lot of people , and you can disagree with the sensible people , if you have something that is not economic , and it 's trying to finance the most of the waste .
because , it 's very short about a brief , and funded the learning curve , and i think we should have to try to be more things that have a potential less expensive .
if you get the <unk> , you know , a very high <unk> , you can just keep the wealthy .
i mean , each of us could spend five times as much for our energy without change his lifestyle .
the bottom two billion is a disaster .
and even <unk> is thinking .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is that the research is not going to do more people ? ''
it 's still , because of his earlier stories , with the <unk> of the <unk> , but he understood that that 's a very common group , and therefore he 's going to get the <unk> .
and this is a line that i think that i believe is appropriate .
the research , it 's crazy , it 's crazy .
bill , i think i 'm going to talk for almost everybody , when i say , i really hope that your wish is being true . thanks very much .
bg : thanks .
a few years ago , here , peter <unk> <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> . ''
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> , the biggest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , ca n't get tape , about <unk> thread and put a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and even though it 's really easy , it actually really hard to work very quickly to work very quickly .
and i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since , i 've done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there 's something to be involved in the nature of nature of collaboration and i want to share with some of them .
normally most people start to <unk> themselves .
you talk about it is what it will look like , they 're going to power them .
then they invest a little time and organization , and they put them out .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> of trees .
and finally , shortly before you do n't have time , somebody takes the marshmallow and you put the <unk> on the top , go back a step back and <unk> your work .
but then , almost , almost always , is that the `` <unk> '' is being <unk> because the weight of the <unk> is that the whole thing is time and <unk> .
there 's a series of people who have <unk> much more <unk> than others , and below the worst , <unk> .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused and they are really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there is teams of <unk> , and there are <unk> alumni of <unk> .
and that 's pretty amazing .
what peter told us is not only the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you may be wondering : how is this ? why is this ?
and peter told me , `` none of the children are investing at the time of law . ''
they do n't invest in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and in fact , that <unk> were trained to find a real plan , ok .
and then we realize .
then what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you do n't have time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what 's going to do is that they start building the marshmallow and building prototypes to build prototypes to the marshmallow of the <unk> that they have a chance to repair <unk> prototypes .
and in fact , these kinds of collaboration as the heart of a <unk> .
and with each time , the children get instant feedback , which works and what does n't .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , but we even see how different teams are doing .
the average , most of the average is about <unk> , <unk> , the half of the lawyers are more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
<unk> is the highest that i 've seen .
and why ? because they 're understanding and <unk> geometric patterns of building the key to stable structures .
ceos are something about average . but this is interesting .
you 're going to be a copyright <unk> of the team , you will get significant better .
it 's incredible . they 're seeing and see this team will win . ''
you can predict this . why is this ?
because they have special abilities .
they 're leading the process , you understand him .
and this team that regulates and the job is going to be significantly greater <unk> .
for example , and <unk> and the combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical <unk> , you get about six , the stable structures .
now , i tried a very exciting thing .
i thought we get the same <unk> .
so i offered a <unk> <unk> for the winner .
what do you think about these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if somebody had built a <unk> construction , he had carried out at the price of it .
so is it not interesting that high testosterone have a strong effect ?
we <unk> this exercise with the same students .
what do you think about this ?
now , she understood the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
this is the same thing , bad team of a under the best .
they produce the highest construction in the least .
so there are <unk> lessons for us about nature of <unk> and success .
you like , why would someone make any time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i <unk> digital tools and processes to help teams , video games , video games and <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> does is , they 're helping them hidden assumptions .
because open , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge , a common experience , a common language , or <unk> , the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience that 's so simple exercise .
and those of them , they 're interested in .
it 's a blog where you can make the <unk> .
there 's a <unk> place there .
you find crazy examples of all the world how people get rid of the system and <unk> .
there is also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is the construction of a <unk> sport .
it 's going to be able to make us all our senses on the quest and we 're able to use our thinking , like our feelings , and our feelings , in the challenge that 's us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all of what it needs to bring us from a `` <unk> '' moment to a `` <unk> . ''
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
so we would like this as we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a machine machine machine .
and everybody has to go into this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; they ca n't stay in here and now remain .
and i wondered what they would choose because i 've been asked my friends in last time , and they wanted to go into the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back in time before there were cars or twitter or america , or america 's <unk> .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of <unk> to nostalgia is thinking .
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say .
i do n't want to do in the past , and that 's not because i am an example .
it 's because of the planet is not going back to this planet , they go ahead .
so i want to do in this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that has ever been on this planet , what is you going to do it : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities .
there was never a time like this .
my <unk> were dying as they were 60 .
my grandparents were this number on 70 .
my parents are 80 to iraq .
so , so there should be a nine at the beginning of my beginning .
but it 's not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that is born in new delhi is expected to live as long as the richest man on the world 's 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth as well as it has no war .
they 're away . they 're gone .
we <unk> them . <unk> .
in the rich world , in the rich world , millions of us only have under a generation of us , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
does anybody even know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billion people , which is successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method to try to explore whether it works if it does n't do that , one of the most great achievement of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , that 's the good news , because there 's a few other issues , and they were already mentioned .
and one of them , despite all of our achievements , for all of our achievements , a billion people on this world is getting hungry every day .
this number is rising , and it goes very quickly , and that 's a shame .
and not just that , we used to destroy our imagination , that the world is sustainable .
drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and if we do n't go from this chaos , we end up .
so the question is : can we do this ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the land that they live in .
i think we can feed the world with energy that is not destroyed at the same time .
i really believe this , and no , that 's not a wishful thinking .
but this is me going to wake up me at night -- one of the things that i 'm going to wake up at night . we 've never had science progress as well as well .
and we 've never been able to make a reasonable <unk> system that we can do today .
we 're on the verge of amazing , amazing events on many places , and but i really think we have to go hundreds of , 300 years ago to find the enlightenment , where we have progress , in which we 've done progress in which we 've been fighting over these things , more
the people <unk> themselves in their faith , and that 's so deeply , that you ca n't free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion , even a right on the opinion of progress .
but you know what they do ?
you have n't right on your own facts . <unk> , you do n't have .
and i took a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a article about immunization for `` the new yorker , '' a little article .
and i was surprised to cross the resistance to the resistance of resistance to what 's going on the end of health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what i should do , so i just did what i 'm doing , i wrote a article and the <unk> .
and it 's soon i wrote a article about <unk> changed .
same thing , only bigger .
they were crazy .
so i was written about a article , and i could n't understand why the people thought that would be `` <unk> , why they believed that molecules on a certain kind of <unk>
but you know , i 'm doing . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i 'm journalist .
we go , we 're eating , we eat , this is okay .
but this article did me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it out .
and that 's because these <unk> were crazy all at all .
these were <unk> people , educated people , <unk> people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and this has been <unk> .
but then i thought , you know , be honest .
we 're on a point that we do n't have the same relationship to advance the same thing .
we talk to <unk> .
we talk ironic about little <unk> : progress .
okay , so there 's a reason for that , and i think that the reasons are .
we have faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science , and there is no reason why that should not be .
you can call a few names and you can understand people .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions , and there are problems that we thought that they were always quite <unk> .
ask questions , demand the evidence , demand for evidence .
do n't you have any given .
but now it comes , if you have a evidence , you need to look at this evidence , and we 're not good at it .
and i can say that we 're going to live in a epidemic of fear that i 've never seen and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story ago , a terrible story that <unk> the <unk> with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
very frightening .
lots of studies have been conducted to see whether this was true .
a lot of studies should be done ; this is a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s from the united states , from sweden , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference because we think we see what we see to see what we need to do that we 're really comfortable .
we do n't think about a bunch of documents from a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was <unk> .
because of this fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries on the world , in the rate of <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> , and we should feel ashamed .
it 's awful .
what 's happening is that we could do that .
well , i understand this .
because somebody 's someone <unk> ?
have a single one in the audience ever see anybody die ?
not very often .
in this country , in this country , but 160,000 times on the world in the last year .
these are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
but not because this is not here , we can replace it up , and people like <unk> <unk> are <unk> and <unk> from platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they are not connecting and connection .
they do n't understand that these things seem like , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he just developed a few other people with a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , this is good , except for example , that paul <unk> and says , `` how valuable you are , and that the people should just stop inevitable .
and he actually says this .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul <unk> in a public <unk> , he ca n't reveal without <unk> <unk> .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a <unk> .
i do n't need that , but , <unk> is essential .
you continue to go back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and it happens .
we 've got in this country now .
and that 's worse , and quite soon children will die again , because this is just a question of the numbers .
and they 're not just going to die .
what about <unk> ? take this . why not ?
one of me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i 'm a little bit of <unk> .
nobody ever heard this before .
she would not make her child against <unk> .
subtle .
why ? because we have <unk> , and you know what ?
we had no <unk> in this country .
today , i do n't know , perhaps someone 's going to come up in lagos , and this is just going to los angeles , right now he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours , it lands and <unk> a car , and he gets to long beach , and he 's going to visit one of these <unk> tonight .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a <unk> disease , and we do n't know , because the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . do n't like it .
we love the <unk> . we love this .
have you all <unk> your morning ?
<unk> , a small <unk> , that 's going to help you get you .
i know you did that , because half of americans are doing that every day .
they take this stuff , and they take a alternative cure , and it does n't make any difference how much we find that they are useless .
the data came back all .
they are <unk> your urine . they 're going to do almost .
this is okay , i want to like to do 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
and i agree with you .
it 's dark . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> industry .
we hate a strong government . we do n't have faith into the system .
and we should not . our health care is <unk> .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing and <unk> itself to us .
so we 're running away , and where do we walk ?
we 're walking into the poor of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of artifacts here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , <unk> , i do n't know what this is , but we give billions of dollars for this , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? when i say the people on and say , `` what does it matter ? let me do what they want .
that 's how they feel good . ''
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
because it does n't matter whether it 's the health care of health , says , `` hmm , i 'm not going to assume the evidence of mammography , '' or some <unk> that wants to treat his patient with <unk> .
if you 're going to get out on this path , where belief and magic evidence and science , they get to a place that you do n't want .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> drugs are much more effectively more effective more effective than the <unk> drugs that we know that they can eat the way of aids .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than each other of this disease .
please do n't tell me that these things have no consequences .
you have them . you have .
well , the <unk> epidemic that we just face is that absurd struggle between the <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , each branch , every <unk> , has been changed by the people .
you know , there were no <unk> in paradise .
there was no restaurant chains .
there were no <unk> . we did this .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of that has worked and some of them .
we got rid of what does n't work .
now we can do this . and of course , there is risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that can help millions of people , millions of people ,
do n't you want to do this ?
i have to say that i do n't understand .
we reject <unk> food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm listening is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want a huge huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we do n't want to patent companies .
we do n't want to own companies .
and you know what my answer is this ?
yes , you 're right . fix it .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but it 's not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not a idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow us to do their work , because we fear is a real dead end , and she 's holding millions of people .
you know , in the next 50 years , we need 70 percent more food than at the moment .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they need it , and we do n't give them .
and why ? <unk> changed .
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff like for example .
<unk> is something a half billion people .
it 's about the potato .
it 's just a bundle of calories . it 's <unk> .
it does n't have nutrients , it does n't have any protein , and scientists are building all that in that .
and then people could eat the food and would n't be blind .
would n't be starvation , and you know what ?
it would be nice . it would n't be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and everything i can say is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , ask us : why do we fight this ?
because we do n't want to <unk> genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our silly passion for hormones , our faith on greater food , better food , unique food .
it 's not about rice flying , and it 's about getting people to get people alive , and it becomes the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we do so far as far , we do n't have guilty that we do n't want to be guilty , <unk> colonialism .
there is no other description for what happens .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not a <unk> , and we have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , `` you want to go in this ridiculous time and go into the future ? ''
right . i want to do that .
right now , in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine time for everything we want .
we can tell you where we want them to <unk> them , and we 're going to move them where we want .
we have to lead these conversations , and we have to think , but if we get into the time machine , we will be relieved to do that .
i know that we can , and here are something that 's going to be what the world takes place .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i 've been interested in the <unk> . it may be funny that a magician was interested in that , because , as i think , as `` a deception that 's going to be true , if someone only exists enough . ''
in other words , <unk> have shown a measurable effect , the <unk> , and that 's just because the person thinks about what happens to your mind is a <unk> or a kind of -- in the <unk> , for example , the patient thinks that the patient thinks that the patient thinks that the patient thinks that the patient thinks about it ,
a deception is going to be true because somebody happens .
so to let us understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental magic trick .
and i 'll show you what he works . this is a trick that has been at least at the 1950s for children .
and i 've learned it from the <unk> magic of the <unk> <unk> in the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for you and explain it .
and i 'll explain why i 'll explain him .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand you can study .
i 'm going to keep the knife in my own .
i <unk> my sleeve .
and to make sure that does n't make any sleeve or out of him , i just get my wrist on here .
in this way , you can see that you ca n't move anything . as long as i 'm going on here , nothing can go in my sleeve or see .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything is going to get well , that becomes <unk> through my bare physical sphere .
it 's actually so <unk> that i can shake it , without <unk> <unk> .
nothing goes into my sleeve or does n't get <unk> . and they can study everything .
yay !
now , this is a trick that i 'm going to <unk> a lot of little kids who are interested in is magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look at , even though it 's a very simple trick .
now , many of you now know here in the room here .
so he works .
i think that knife in my hand .
i say , i 'm going to make my wrist on that , to make sure that no surprises , or <unk> , and that 's a lie .
the reason i 'm going to <unk> my wrist is that the actual secret of the illusion is .
right now , where i 'm going to <unk> my hand of you , so you see them from the back of the back here , this finger , my <unk> , is just there , where he was in a position that 's like <unk> .
amazing trick ?
there 's someone sitting in the back , that 's not a childhood .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i <unk> me , the fingers changes his position .
and now you could talk about why this one is a deception , why you ca n't see , because the mind is because the mind and the way that the mind is , you know , it 's not one of them , two , two , three , but you see .
but this is not going to do this , and then i open my hand .
of course , it 's being caught there , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , through my body <unk> , that 's now .
and when i <unk> my hand , the same way , when i <unk> me , through these motion is hidden that the fingers went back .
i take this hand . and here 's the knife .
this trick can you show your friends and your friends . thank you .
well , what does that have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that really did me really <unk> .
i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and therefore that was an amazing thing .
because it turns out this : if you offer a <unk> in the form of a white ball , the form of <unk> , that 's just a round , white pill , which has a certain results .
but if you get the shape , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , in a smaller pill , and that 's the blue <unk> and a letter that is actually <unk> more effective .
and that , despite any of these <unk> -- they 're just <unk> .
but a white pill is not so good as a blue pill .
what ? that 's really crazy .
but it turns out that this is not all .
if you get <unk> , it 's more likely to get <unk> .
one colored capsule that 's on a end , and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the <unk> is a role .
one five thousand times is not like three pills -- i ca n't remember the exact statistics . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
that 's what the <unk> play play .
and the form is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to grab the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a couple of <unk> substance of a <unk> substance of a patient .
this is a very strong picture . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .
this is really the graph really , i 'm going to show you another time when we have a <unk> .
so the fact is that the white pill does n't seem so much as well as the blue pill that does n't work like a <unk> like a capsule that does n't work like the needle .
and it does n't have any really <unk> property . it 's just our faith in us to get a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i 'm going to take something obvious , clearly a deception is , and it 's a real thing .
we know from the study that you have to switch to the needle when it is to go .
this is a 18 inches of <unk> . it 's very , very , very <unk> . and i 'll start a little <unk> .
this is really my meat . it 's not a <unk> <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
now , i 'm going to stick this needle in my skin and push them through the other side .
if you 're going to fall , if you fall bad -- i put this a few friends on the room last night in the room room , and some people who i did n't know , and it 's a woman that has been a <unk> .
so i suppose , if you 're going to be a good , you 'll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what i 'm going to do the first <unk> of this .
you can see it in the same way , but you can see , you can also be able to see if you want .
so , it 's like that , which is exactly where my meat starts to make a little bit of <unk> i 'm going to do .
really i 'm sorry . does it make this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now , we are actually in the same situation that we had with <unk> .
you know .
but now , you ca n't count my finger , right ?
so , i 'll show you . that 's one , two , three , four .
well ,
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , `` okay , that 's not that stupid and <unk> itself , just to give us a few minutes for us . ''
well , i 'll show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and they say , `` okay . i did n't have seen this . ''
the people in the <unk> are in now .
let me show you close to you .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can <unk> this .
sorry . if it 's bad . i mean , they 're going to go away .
and the back of the back or the one later , the little bit of the video later , you will say , `` well , that 's pretty impressive , but if it would be real , he would see , here 's a hole , here if it would be real , it would be surprising . ''
okay , let me a little blood for you .
yes , it 's .
usually i would have the needle the needle .
i would tell you my arm that there is no wounds .
but i think in this picture here and with the intention , from a deception , i 'm going to just get the needle in there and go from the stage .
we 'll look at the next few days .
i hope you 're looking for . thank you .
everyone speaks about happiness .
i have a few people <unk> the number of books that have been released with `` <unk> '' in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there were much more .
there 's a big wave of the interest in happiness .
there 's a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all the flood of these flood , there are multiple cognitive <unk> , which are very impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk is mainly from these cognitive cognitive cognitive materials .
this is true for <unk> , which is thinking about their happiness , and it 's for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so <unk> like everybody else .
the first of these fall is a <unk> , complexity admit .
it turns out that the word `` happiness is not a useful word , because we apply to a lot of different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we could have to shrink it , but this is something that we have to be , and we 're going to have to take the complicated view of what well-being .
the second trap is a sense of experience and memory : basically you 're going to be between life and happily in your life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and this is the most part of the fact that we ca n't think about a case that affects well-being without being stressed .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to start with a example of someone who had had a <unk> , one of my lectures , [ unclear ] in the [ unclear ] . ] he told him a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and the end of the <unk> of the recording was a <unk> <unk> .
and then he added to it , really emotional , that 's all the experience of experience .
but that 's not .
what it 's experienced was the memories of experience .
he had the experience .
he had six minutes of music .
she was not <unk> because he was <unk> with a memory , the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything that he had to get .
what this really says is that we could think about others and about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> itself that lives in the present , and the present is able to experience the past again , but basically the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , the doctor 's the doctor -- you know when the doctor asks : `` does it hurt if i <unk> here ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and the <unk> itself is that the <unk> , and the story of our lives get upright , and it 's the one of the doctor <unk> the question , `` how did you felt in last time ? ''
or `` what was your journey after albania ? '' or something like this .
these are two very different units , the <unk> itself , and the <unk> itself , and the two pieces of <unk> itself is , and the two of the <unk> is part of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
well , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this is starting with a very fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately immediately .
we do n't just tell stories to tell us to tell stories .
our memory is telling us stories that 's going to keep us a story .
and let 's start with one example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who are <unk> .
i wo n't go into detail . it 's not painful , but it was painful as this trial was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds to report .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask , `` who of two did have suffered ? ''
and this is a very simple question .
the patient b has more suffered . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had had a patient b , and more .
but now there is another question , `` how much did these patients think that they have suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient had a much more <unk> <unk> than the patient b .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story ends .
and not that stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is that clearly ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the worse , the worse , when the pain was completely at the end of his peak . it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we have asked those people for their <unk> , and also , `` how bad was the whole thing about this ? ''
and she was much worse for a than a b for b .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
from the point of view , b had an <unk> time .
well , what you could do with the patient , and we 've done in clinical trials , and it has been done , and it 's worked , and it would actually actually be used to be the <unk> of the patient 's going to get the tubing inside of him .
that will lead to the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you make this a few minutes for a few minutes , that <unk> itself is to be a bad self , and you have the <unk> self is a much better , because now you have given the patient a better
what is a story ?
and this is true of the stories that creates the memory and it 's true for the stories that we invent .
and what a story is <unk> are <unk> , great moments and ends .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end of the time .
now , the <unk> itself is continuously continuously .
this is the moments of the <unk> , one after the others .
and they ask , what happens to this moments ?
and the answer is just easy . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i know that -- you know , the psychological present for psychological is about about three seconds , you know , in a day , there 's about 600,000 . most of them do n't do anything .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet you somehow get the impression that they should count that what 's happening during this moments of the <unk> life .
it 's the limited resource that we consume in this world .
and as we use them to be important , but that 's not the story that keeps the most hidden itself for us .
so we have the <unk> itself , and the <unk> itself , and they 're really different .
the biggest difference between them is the value of time .
from the point of the <unk> itself , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly like the first week , the <unk> vacation is twice as well as a <unk> vacation .
that does n't work for the <unk> itself .
so for the <unk> , a <unk> vacation is hardly <unk> to the <unk> vacation because there 's no new memories .
they did n't change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is slightly different from a <unk> itself .
now , the <unk> itself is more than thinking about and stories .
it 's actually the one that makes the decisions , because if you have a patient , you know , we have two <unk> kids in two different people , and you decide what he 's supposed to do is the memory that the memory is that the
the <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
actually we choose between <unk> . we choose between experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we usually think about our future .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at that , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> itself , and you can think about the <unk> itself as one , the way that the <unk> itself does n't need to do the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that when we 're going to get a lot of the things that is , which is , we 're going to do a vacation in the services of <unk> itself .
and that 's a little difficult to justify that .
i mean , how much of our memories of our memories ?
this is one of the main reasons for the dominance of the <unk> itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we 've done a few years ago that i was quite a couple of years ago that i had ever had the best vacation that i had ever had , and i think , in the relationship , i think ,
and i 've probably have the memories of these <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever opened the folder that i could have spent about 600 images i would have spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and this is a half a year .
there 's a disagreement .
well , i like a little extreme , you know , like a little bit of memory , but even if they 're going to make a real question . why do we give the other weight on the weight of the weight that we give
so i want to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the <unk> , your images are <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug , so they will not remember .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a different nightmare , there 's a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how they 're going to decide , because if you think of the sense of time , you get the answer , and if you could think about the sense of memories you could think of
why we choose the <unk> that we 're saying is a problem with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self is two words of happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can use for one per self .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask , how happy are the moments in life of life itself ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a very complicated process .
what are the emotions that are measured ?
and , by the way , we 're now able to get a fairly good notion of happiness at time .
if you ask for happiness , it 's a very different thing .
that 's not what happy is alive .
it 's like satisfied or <unk> the person when this person is thinking about your life .
very different term .
everybody who is not unlike the study of happiness , and i am a lot of researchers about well-being that <unk> the study of happiness .
and the distinction between the happiness of the <unk> itself , and the happiness of <unk> itself has been recognized in the last years , and now you get to measure the two x-ray .
the <unk> organization has been a world survey , with a half million people have been wondering about what they think about her life , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the two types of self .
and the one of the main lesson that we think i 've learned is that they are really different .
you know how someone is satisfied with his life , and the teaches people really do about how happy he lives and vice versa .
only to give you a sense of correlation that correlation is correlation .
what that means is that if you would meet someone , and you would say , `` oh , father is a <unk> , how much people know about his greatness ?
well , you would know something about the size , but there is a lot of uncertainty .
you have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has his life as eight of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> itself .
so that 's connection .
we know something about what determines happiness .
we know that money is very important , to be very important .
we know that happiness mainly meant to be satisfied with people we like to spend time we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is a dominant .
so , if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self , you 're going to do very different things .
so the conclusion i 've been told here is that we really are not going to be relatively <unk> than a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely different word .
well , very short , another reason that we ca n't think about happiness is that we do n't think about the same things when we think about life and if we live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question that people have to be happier in california if you 're , let 's live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself , and it 's not even very important for the <unk> itself , the decides that are happy .
but , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can end up with the end , some people could pull down to california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track what happens to people who happens to california , to become happier , happier .
now , your <unk> itself is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . they 're going to think you 're happier , because if you 're going to think about it , you 're thinking about the weather of the weather in ohio . and they will feel that they get the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of that hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you very much .
now , when we have a few weeks ago , you know , you know that there were a pretty interesting results that came from this <unk> survey .
is that something that you can give us to do is because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : safe .
i think that 's the most interesting thing that we have found in the survey survey that we did n't have to find .
we found this in the happiness of the <unk> itself .
when we looked at a <unk> , how feelings with income .
and it turns out that under a year , under 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big representative sample in a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are <unk> , and they will be more happy , the deceased .
so we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what happens is , clearly , money is not an <unk> , but that lack of misery is likely to get some misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other itself , the <unk> itself , they get another story .
the more money you have a happier of the happier .
that 's not for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it 's about life , freedom to happiness .
if people would take this principles seriously , i mean , it seems to make everything we think we believe in terms of <unk> and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians think that the country is generally taking a question as seriously , and that would make it based on policy ?
dk : you know , i think that is a <unk> of the role of the argument in politics .
the <unk> is going to be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , she 's going to happen in other countries .
and people are to realize that they should think about happiness when they think about politics .
it 's going to be a while , and people are going to discuss whether they 're going to explore , or whether they want to study <unk> , and we have to explore this discussion pretty soon .
so , how to become happiness is very different from how you think and think about the <unk> yourself or whether they think about the <unk> themselves .
this will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you have to measure the <unk> of the population .
that 's what i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this topic is going to be , or at least , at least the most interesting debate to be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thanks , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane <unk> . i design video games .
i think about 10 years for 10 years , and my goal is to make it just as easy to save the world in reality as they 're in <unk> .
i have a plan for that , and i 'd like to convince more people , including everybody , more time to spend greater and <unk> games .
now , we spend three billion hours a week .
some of you may think , `` this is a whole bunch of time for games . ''
maybe a little time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
in fact , in my institute , the idea of the future , is exactly the opposite to <unk> .
three billion hours per week is not close enough to solve the issues of the world .
in fact , i 'm convinced that when we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i have computing that the age of the 21st billion hours per week .
this might be a little bit of things that might be a little bit <unk> , so i 'm going to do it : if we want to solve the hunger , climate change , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , for at least 11 billion hours a week
no , i really mean seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty exactly why i think that games are so important for the survival of the human species in the future .
this is the photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to catch the feelings in games . so he had a camera on the players .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
if you 're not a player , you may not prevent some of the <unk> in this picture .
you 're probably going to see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also very much concentration , a <unk> problem .
if you 're playing , you see some <unk> here , the <unk> eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows on the top .
this is a player that 's called the outskirts of a <unk> <unk> .
wow , you know that . ok . so we have a few players here .
a <unk> alarm is a result that 's so <unk> that they did n't know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you get it , they are shocked that they 're capable of being able to be . this is a <unk> victory .
this player is short to a <unk> <unk> .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces on the world when we take the source of the next century , the face of all odds on the edge of the edge of a <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we look at this face of the real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it , `` in life i 'm bad . '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? ok ?
that 's what i am in life i 'm bad .
this is a graffiti in my former school in berkeley , california , where i was in my thesis in my thesis , and i looked at why we are better than in play .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think that we are not so good at the reality .
and i do n't know less successful , even though that 's going to be .
we 're going to get more . i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean in the context of motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired by collaboration .
when we 're in a <unk> , i think that many of us are turning in our best version , and immediately , the problem is going to solve the problem of solving it , like to try to try it .
and in reality , if we fail , when we poke on obstacles , we 're always feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> . we feel threatened , maybe depressed or <unk> .
these feelings have never play when we 're playing games , they 're not just playing .
and this is what i wanted to study as a <unk> .
why is impossible , to think , you could n't just get everything ?
how can we spread these feelings from the play ?
so i looked like to play the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment to the collaborative environment .
and i noticed some things that can make the epic <unk> in <unk> .
so first , if you get in one of those <unk> , all of the world 's world , there 's a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and it immediately immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission , which is perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
so they create this .
they never get a task that they ca n't solve .
but still on the edge of your skills , so you have a lot , but there is no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you 're not around and <unk> . there 's always a very specific important thing .
and there are lots of collaborators .
now , where they 're going to go , hundreds of people to work together to work with you , to explore their epic mission .
that 's what we do n't have in the real life , that feeling that in a <unk> amount of employees .
also , there 's this epic story , and this inspirational story is why we are there and what we have .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you have a level of level , and <unk> strength , '' or <unk> intelligence .
this constant feedback is not in the real life .
when i leave this stage , i did n't do it : <unk> crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i do n't get into the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of the <unk> like the world of warcraft is that there is so powerful , time in the edge of a <unk> , that we would rather spend our time in these <unk> .
they 're just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of <unk> are working together to solve the virtual issues of <unk> .
this is not something bad .
maybe it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context : <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> started to go .
so the first kind of <unk> <unk> .
okay , so if we talk about how much time we spend a lot of time , it just makes sense when you 're looking at the time of the scale of the human flourishing looking at what is extraordinarily .
but also , because it turns out , because it turns out that we can use this whole time to play , actually , actually , what we 're able to do as people .
we 're going to connect us , so you 're different .
that 's the truth . i think .
let 's look at this interesting statistics that recently published an example from an researchers in carnegie mellon university , the average man of today has spent about 10,000 hours to 10,000 hours with <unk> .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of the time , for children in the u.s. , <unk> hours of <unk> , the exact <unk> of the school that they spend in high school , from the five grade for high school -- if you never do .
so , we have a complete <unk> <unk> , on the young people that mean , what it means to be a good player , how all you learn to school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> . ''
so you know his theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours .
she 's based on the great science of <unk> , that when we spend 10,000 hours with a little bit of <unk> in the 21st century , we will go to <unk> .
we 're going to be so good at what the most significant people of the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what exactly are <unk> <unk> ? ''
because if we could find that , we never would have been able to have <unk> human potential .
so many people we have in the world , at least , at least , at least we spend at least one hour a day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinary good in `` something . ''
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are very good in what are always .
you know , if you have n't heard it .
the <unk> , <unk> , the energy are saving and work on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so a player on the world , especially in india , china can play online .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
we have a total of 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what this is to address this games .
here 's the four things i found . as first : <unk> .
ok , imagine the extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the craving to do immediately , a challenge , with the belief that we have a <unk> hope for success .
player always believe that one of the <unk> is possible , and it 's always worth it to try and the same .
player ca n't sit .
players are experts in spiders of spiders .
there 's a lot of more interesting research , which show us to people more than we played with them , even if you were <unk> .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with a game .
we rely on the fact that somebody 's time playing with us is that the rules are going to be <unk> that we have the same purpose and go to the <unk> .
so , these are the games of ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we 're building stronger social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic .
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of <unk> is 22 hours a week , like a <unk> .
the reason is that if we 're playing , we 're actually happier to work hard as if we do n't do it .
we know that when human beings work directly , if we do hard work .
and they are always ready to work hard to work if you get the right job .
and finally , <unk> meaning .
players love to become a part of the awe of the satisfaction to be <unk> .
here 's a <unk> , to back the right light . you know all wikipedia , the biggest <unk> of the world .
the second largest <unk> of the world , with nearly 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
you have <unk> more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than about some other things in every other <unk> of the world .
they 're creating a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , these are four collar that are leading to a single outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
there are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world .
that 's the problem i 'm trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied why people are doing so much time and money in <unk> .
and he says , `` we will not be able to be less than one <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and this is an economist . so it 's logical .
and he says ...
not as i am -- i think i find games , i 'm a little <unk> .
so he says that makes sense , because player can be able to go more than in real life .
they can become a lot of social relations with real life , they get more feedback and reward .
so , he says , right now , it 's the right sense that players are going to be more time in the virtual world in the real world .
i just agree that is logical .
but it 's definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that uses 2,500 years ago .
there are these <unk> , from <unk> , you know ?
this fantastic <unk> was <unk> .
and these were like the first of people developed <unk> .
and if you 're familiar with the mechanics of the old greek <unk> , you may know the story about how and why games were invented .
<unk> <unk> were games , in the kingdom of the kingdom , in the kingdom .
in fact , what we had was such a big famine , which was the king of <unk> decided to do a crazy idea .
<unk> . people fought .
it was a extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so she invented , loud , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy . you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much into the <unk> of <unk> , because games are so fascinating and <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they were able to eat nothing .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and <unk> , it survived that famine for 18 years to eat in a day and the next <unk> .
so , i think , <unk> games .
we 're playing games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we 're going to put games into the real world that does n't work in the real world in the real world , and we get in the real life , and we get us out of what we need to play .
but that does n't have to be the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
<unk> <unk> has been <unk> to 18 years , so the king , a last <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they played a <unk> , and the winner had to break down a <unk> adventure .
they were leaving the quest for a new home , and they were looking back to a new home , and they had so much people like food , and looking at the rest of the time they could thrive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but latest <unk> show that the <unk> <unk> , that later , the <unk> rich , the same dna like the old <unk> .
so scientists came to the notion that <unk> of the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found this evidence of a global cooling , it took almost 20 years , which could explain the famine .
so this is the crazy story .
you may actually saved their people by playing games by making 18 years in games and then had these <unk> and then learned that they had saved the whole civilization .
so we can .
we 've been playing with 1994 .
this was the first <unk> of the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were <unk> for 18 years , we 've been playing with 16 years .
i would argue , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so they sent half of the civilization on the search for a new world , so i take my 21st billion <unk> per week .
we need to focus on that half of us have spent an hour per day to play , until we have solved the issues of the real world .
i know you will ask , `` how do we solve the issues of the real world ? '' and exactly this question i have my job to work on the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our office in <unk> alto , like we should understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best outcome , and then people want to make this idea in reality .
we ask ourselves <unk> <unk> and give people the opportunities to achieve .
i 'll show you two games that i designed to try to try to try to make people live <unk> in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a <unk> that you have to get across .
the <unk> is invented , but we 're invented , so it 's going to be <unk> , and they 're actually making your real life , so if you 're going to do it , and they 're going to cross the oil , and they have to get it up , and they need to figure out how they 're going to make their real life , and they ask them to get their real life , and we ask them to fill it true , and we ask them to do it ,
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we have accompanied them since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you 're in a <unk> adventure , and they 're told , `` we 're going to do this . ''
that 's a fascinating adventure to go .
find out how they would survive , most of our players have maintained in the game <unk> habits .
so we have a bigger game for a bigger point of time , more of the best goal in the world .
we have a game called `` <unk> '' on the future .
starting to start is the computation is that people just have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer called global <unk> <unk> , of course .
the call on the players , the sign , we created almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where there 's the `` <unk> '' and you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the <unk> , and it 's our job , food , food , hunger and the future of social justice .
8,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 kinds of creative solutions they can read if they look at `` <unk> . ''
and the last game we bring in three . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you get the game , you get from the world bank , `` social <unk> , '' at 2010 .
we are working with universities in the sub-saharan africa and store them to learn social <unk> .
we have a comic book , we have <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , sustainability and ingenuity .
i 'd like to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , all in the world , all of the world , all of the world is able to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .
i 'll come to the end .
i want to ask you a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree that gamers are human resource that we can apply to work in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have this whole total superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to create strong social networks , <unk> and demand for <unk> .
i really hope we 'll play very strong games to survive on this planet .
and i hope you will play with play and play .
and if i 'm going to get back to two people , i 'm sure that we can create any <unk> future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let 's start the <unk> games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something that a couple of months ago was written by a written article on <unk> .
i always put my <unk> <unk> , but i was done with the process of <unk> , and i fell in my life that i 've never been <unk> in my life , which is really <unk> the word `` <unk> . ''
i read you the one .
`` a kid , '' <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> : healthy , strong .
i had this list to read this list of a friend of reading and i had to really laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was just <unk> , and i had to stop <unk> , and i had to listen to read , and i had to listen to read , and i had to listen to read , and i had to listen to the first of this <unk> <unk> .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , i thought that the copy has to be a <unk> .
but in fact , it was a braille on the early 1980s , when i started in elementary school , and started to build my self sphere of my family sphere and form in terms of the world , also in terms of the world , and to the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i did n't use a <unk> .
would i have been a little bit serious that would be born in a world like me as a person who can perceive me , but i 'm going to do today , but i 'm going to do for the odds and i 'm going to have the opportunity for the opportunity that i 've experienced .
so i immediately <unk> the <unk> of 2009 , and i thought that i find a <unk> contribution .
here 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
it 's not much better .
in particular , the last two words <unk> me , near <unk> , `` well , '' `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about what we think about the people that we 'll describe with these words .
it 's about the values that are put in these words and how we build these values .
our language impacts our thinking and how we look at the world around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the <unk> , have really believed that the <unk> is a big force , because what you can feel <unk> .
so what are we going to <unk> -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
in fact , just a person who is supposed to call <unk> as a child , you know , they 're <unk> , and they will <unk> ideas .
would n't it be nice to open the doors ?
a person who opened up the doors was my pediatrician in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> in <unk> .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , that name , like you can think , most americans were not exactly whether he was called dr. p. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> was going to fly very colorful , and was just about kids like created .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , pretty good -- to my <unk> .
i had to make those kinds of exercises and <unk> these <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated it , and i hated it . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine i even have a <unk> child with dr. p. art , and so i tried to stop these exercises , without success .
and one day he saw me in one of my exercises -- these exercises were just <unk> and boats -- and he told me , `` wow , you 're like a strong , <unk> girls , you 're going to pull one day .
and if you do it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i tried to make the exercises that i wanted to do with my mind , but he actually <unk> me to see my everyday eyes with new eyes . so it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i 'm going to wonder about how much his vision of me as strong and <unk> young girl shaped my self , and i could imagine as a strong , powerful and powerful people .
this is just a example of many , how adults can prompt the imagination of a child .
but as a result , look for example from the <unk> evidence that we do n't have any room to imagine what we would all wish to do : it would be able to see every single one , to see than a powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that caused in many cases of technological change .
and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course ,
so maybe this kind of technology is also going to be clear , because there 's always a different truth , which is that every person can be very <unk> and very <unk> , and that human ability to adapt to the biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- this is a interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me , and i 'm going to tell you something : that sentence has never been <unk> to me , and i believe i understand why .
this sentence from the idea of opportunity to be fought in the idea that success or happiness is to address a challenge of being used to become a <unk> experience , as if my life would be so successful , because i could perceive the kinds of life with my disability .
but the truth is that we change us . of course , we are the challenge of the challenge , whether they 're physical , emotional or even both .
and i would say that is good .
so odds are not simulated debris that we need to <unk> to our lives .
it 's easy to contribute to our lives .
and i tend to look at odds than my shadows .
sometimes i realize that he 's very present , sometimes he 's hardly to see , but it 's constantly at me .
and i do n't want to do that the impact , or the severe part of the <unk> of one people .
there 's an opportunity in life and the challenges that are real real , and every person 's real and any person is going to deal with it , but the question is not , whether we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be clear , but not , but as we can see .
so we 're not just responsible for the people that we love to keep people , but they also have to be able to get to that clear .
and we do n't think of our kids , if we feel that they ca n't adapt .
you have to distinguish two things : to one of the medical fact , for the medical fact , and for the other hand , the social opinion about whether i 'm a child or not .
and to be honest , the only real and an disability i had to make me apart , that the world is constantly telling me with this definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are looking at the hearts and to give them the cool thing about their medical response to the heart of the quality of life , or even a grave to the quality of life that you expect , we have to be <unk> that somebody 's <unk>
maybe that 's the process of the process , which is just going to be the same is that in a broken , and how we repair the repair for every single disability than the medical school .
if we do n't treat a human being <unk> , and not all its forces , and acknowledge , we 're going to create in addition to the natural fight , maybe you may have to make another disease .
we <unk> a human being on our society .
so we have to look at the <unk> , and we have to focus on all the realm of human opportunities .
but most importantly , between the perception of our intelligence and our great <unk> .
we should not be <unk> or denial , we should not try to avoid them , but we should go under the carpet , but it 's about the odds of the odds .
maybe i 'm going to be more likely to make sure that we do n't necessarily have to contribute to innovate , but we 're open to the car , you 're going to put them to <unk> a <unk> and maybe dance to dance .
and maybe we can do it , opportunity to see something natural and useful , and feel that it does n't feel that <unk> .
in this year , we celebrate 200 of charles darwin , and as he wrote a 150 years ago , darwin , darwin , in my eyes , a very real character in human character .
i would be so educated , not the most powerful the most powerful , of course , but the <unk> of his way , can adjust the best changes .
that 's the conflict of creativity .
not just from the darwinian work , we know that the ability of humans , to survive , and <unk> , from the fight of human spirit , to turn into conflict .
so again , change and <unk> are the great ability of people .
and maybe we know from what wood we are <unk> if we really become <unk> .
maybe this is exactly the sense of success , an perception of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can listen to ourselves .
we can fight against an new meaning that goes beyond the heavy times .
maybe we can do harm as change .
and intervention to a change that we still have adapted .
i think the biggest damage that we have to do ourselves is that we 're supposed to be normal .
i mean , who is normal ?
there is no normal species .
you have the usual . the typical . but it 's not the normal . and if you want to know this poor , gray person if it really would be ?
i think i wo n't .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of the normal versus the sun , or the strength to make it even a little dangerous day , and we can release the forces of a lot of children , and they 're in the <unk> of society .
in fact , <unk> found that we have people from the members of our society , useful to be useful and a contribution .
there is evidence that 's <unk> , 60 years ago , there 's older years ago , and people have altered iran with <unk> physical , and maybe it happened to the people that would be valuable to society .
they did n't look at the <unk> and <unk> , they were considered something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in the city where i was raised in a <unk> zone in the northeast zone , and i stood there to a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear a guy behind me , `` well if this is not <unk> . ''
and i stand around , and i see this older man . i did n't know who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know me ? i ca n't remember it . ''
and he said , `` well , you can hardly remember me .
when i first saw them , i got it out of your mom . ''
wow , so .
and of course , it 's <unk> .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i knew about this day , of course , because of course i was very typical to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mom was in vacation , and i knew my parents got to the world , not .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet had a <unk> , and i just had a couple of toes on this and a few toes at the other foot , he had the <unk> , that strangers had to do the bad news .
he said to me , `` i had to tell your parents that you 're never going to walk , and never would never be like the <unk> child , or that you could never make a <unk> life , and they have just <unk> me . ''
in fact , i found that he had been collected by my entire childhood , whether i was in the second grade in the second grade , whether i had my legacy of <unk> , or he used to teach my fellow <unk> , and he used to teach his students to teach his students , and the <unk> medical school
and he called this part of his <unk> of his x , the potential of the human being .
you ca n't realize the question of the quality of life .
and dr. <unk> told me , he said , `` i learned that children , when you 're not going to be a little bit , and if you just get a little support when you get kids , you can get a lot of kids . ''
look , dr. <unk> has changed his mind .
he was understood that the medical diagnosis of diagnosis , and how anybody are doing two different things .
and i have changed my thinking of time when they had asked me at the age of 15 years , if i had my <unk> against meat and bone , i did n't have a second .
i wanted to look at the same time .
if you ask me , i 'm not so safe .
and this is happening because i 've experienced something with my legs and not despite this experiences .
and maybe this change could happen , because i just experienced so many people who have opened up the doors , and to face people , rather than to face people , which <unk> me to focus on me .
look , it really takes one people who can show you what they can show your powers , and they are .
if you allow someone to activate his own , the human mind , the human mind is so <unk> -- if you create this , and for someone in a key moment , you 're very good teachers .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word `` <unk> '' in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means something that is that the potential <unk> .
again , that 's the potential to look at this ?
in the '60s , in britain , <unk> were transformed into <unk> .
they call this `` <unk> <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call that `` <unk> . ''
students get <unk> .
and the a students get <unk> <unk> , and the better teachers are getting so forth .
they then have a <unk> period of students with a `` <unk> '' and a <unk> . it was told you were <unk> that they were very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote this
and of course , it 's going to hear the heart of listening to the heart that the reverse was told the <unk> , they 're just enough .
and it was just like the three months .
but only the ones that were still in school -- apart from the students who had <unk> <unk> .
crucially , in this study , the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
they were just told that the students and that are the students with the class , and they are used to do them and treated them .
the only disability is a <unk> mind , the broken , has no hope , has no hope more . he does n't find our natural object , <unk> curiosity . and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human spirit , to hope to find itself , and other people to find beautiful and other people to be curious , and then we put our powers of our powers .
if a mind is about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i 'd like to end up with a poem that was written by a <unk> poet 's poet called <unk> in the 14 century , and the god says , `` the god knows , '' `` the god knows , '' `` the god knows , '' `` the god knows the god , '' `` every child knows , not the god knows , but the god knows about the god , but the god knows about the god , but the god knows that only about the god knows , but the god knows , he 's just going to say , he always says , he always says , `` come up with me , he just says , `` come up with me , he 's always holding me . '' he 's just <unk> .
come , dance with me . thanks very much .
